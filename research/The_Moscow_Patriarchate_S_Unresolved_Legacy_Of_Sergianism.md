# The Moscow Patriarchate's unresolved legacy of Sergianism

Since the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, Orthodox theologians have repeatedly called for the Moscow Patriarchate to formally condemn both communism and "Sergianism" - the church's subordination to atheist state power. Three decades later, these condemnations remain conspicuously absent, with profound implications for Orthodox ecclesiology and the church's spiritual authority. The Moscow Patriarchate's continued veneration of Soviet-era collaborators, combined with its current relationship with Putin's regime, demonstrates what critics call an unbroken chain of "Sergianist" compromise stretching from 1927 to today.

## The theological roots of Sergianism

Metropolitan Sergius Stragorodsky's July 29, 1927 Declaration fundamentally altered Russian Orthodox ecclesiology by pledging the church's "absolute loyalty" to the Soviet regime. The Declaration proclaimed that Orthodox believers must recognize "the Soviet Union as our civil motherland, whose joys and successes are our joys and successes and whose failures are our failures." This went beyond mere civic obedience - it theologically bound the church's identity to an atheist state actively persecuting believers.

The immediate Orthodox response was dramatic. Up to **90% of Orthodox parishes initially rejected the Declaration**, with approximately 2,500 parishes joining Metropolitan Joseph of Petrograd's resistance movement. The underground "Catacomb Church" emerged, with theologians like Hieromartyr Theodore Andreyev declaring that Sergius had violated the church's fundamental marks of unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity. The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) formally broke communion on September 5, 1927, declaring Moscow's administration "enslaved by the godless Soviet power."

Orthodox theologians identified Sergianism as an **ecclesiological heresy** - a distorted understanding whereby the church serves the world by conforming to it rather than transforming it. Boris Talantov, who died in Soviet prison for his writings, explained that Sergianism created "a false separation of all the spiritual needs of man into the purely religious and the socio-political," requiring believers to support socialist construction while claiming this didn't affect faith.

## Voices demanding condemnation since 1991

The Soviet collapse created unprecedented opportunity for the Moscow Patriarchate to repudiate its compromised past. Instead, a pattern of institutional silence emerged, punctuated by individual voices calling for repentance.

**Fr. Gleb Yakunin** (1936-2014) became the most prominent critic, gaining access to KGB archives in 1992 and revealing extensive church-state collaboration. He exposed the code names of hierarchs including Patriarch Alexius II and published materials showing the Moscow Patriarchate as "practically a subsidiary, a sister company of the KGB." His January 1994 "Second Open Letter to Patriarch Aleksi II" continued pressing for institutional repentance. The church's response was to defrock him in 1993 and excommunicate him in 1997.

**Zoya Krakhmalnikova**, imprisoned for publishing Orthodox samizdat, wrote influentially about "The Bitter Fruits of a Sweet Captivity" in 1989. She argued that opening churches while maintaining Communist Party subordination served no spiritual purpose: "Unless we return to Christian civilization, we will not renew our society."

ROCOR maintained its theological critique throughout, with scholars like **Vladimir Moss** defining Sergianism as "ecclesiological heresy" alongside ecumenism - both representing "a single assault on the existence and the dogma of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church." The 1983 ROCOR anathema against ecumenism explicitly linked it to Sergianism's legacy.

Contemporary voices continue the call. In 2022, **286 Russian Orthodox priests** published an open letter criticizing church support for the Ukraine war. Academic analyses like Ondrej Rac's 2024 paper examine "the problem of Sergianism" in current Moscow Patriarchate ideology. Various True Orthodox jurisdictions refuse communion with Moscow, maintaining it remains in "Sergianist schism."

## Glorifying collaborators while canonizing martyrs

The Moscow Patriarchate's post-Soviet approach reveals a troubling selectivity. While canonizing New Martyrs who died resisting Soviet power - including Patriarch Tikhon (1989), Metropolitan Benjamin of Petrograd, and Tsar Nicholas II (2000) - the church simultaneously venerates those who collaborated.

Most significantly, **Metropolitan Sergius remains honored without qualification**. In 2017, Patriarch Kirill dedicated a statue to Sergius in Arzamas, praising him as someone who "worthily passed his way of the cross as a Patriarch." The local governor called Sergius "a true saint of our land." No synodal decision has condemned the 1927 Declaration or repudiated Sergianism as problematic.

Patriarch Alexy II defended this position in 2001, calling accusations of Sergianism "artificial" and claiming Sergius made "a courageous step by which Metropolitan Sergiy tried to save the Church." This contrasts sharply with ROCOR's historical position, which refused to recognize Moscow Patriarchs from Sergius through Alexis II as canonical.

Unlike the Catholic Church's 1949 "Decree Against Communism" declaring communist sympathizers excommunicated, **no Orthodox synodal decision has formally condemned either communism or Sergianism**. Individual patriarchs may criticize communism - as Kirill did in 2021, calling it responsible for "hundreds of thousands lawlessly executed for their faith" - but institutional condemnation remains absent.

## Contemporary Sergianism under Putin

The Moscow Patriarchate's relationship with Vladimir Putin demonstrates what scholars term "neo-Sergianism" - contemporary manifestation of church subordination to state power. The parallels to 1920s Sergianism are striking and systematic.

Patriarch Kirill has described Putin's rule as **"a miracle of God"** that corrected Russia's "historically wrong path." In 2025, he praised Putin for creating church-state relations "without precedent in our nation's history." This echoes Sergius's 1927 language about the Soviet state's "joys and successes" being the church's own.

The church's support extends to military actions. Kirill blessed the 2022 Ukraine invasion as a "metaphysical struggle" and "Holy War," telling soldiers that "sacrifice in the course of carrying out your military duty washes away all sins." The March 2024 World Russian People's Council officially declared the invasion aimed at destroying Ukrainian independence - a theological justification for territorial conquest.

Financial dependencies reinforce institutional capture. The church receives **"multimillion state subsidies"** through major state corporations. Metropolitan Tikhon, reportedly Putin's confessor, receives funding from "almost all state corporations." Since 2010, nuclear weapons commanders have signed cooperation agreements with the church, integrating religious ceremonies into military institutions.

The "Russian World" ideology, architected by Kirill, provides theological framework for this subordination. Defining territories of "historical Russian influence" as spiritually unified under Moscow, it justifies expansion and intervention - precisely the kind of ideological service to state power that characterized original Sergianism.

## Theological consequences for spiritual authority

Orthodox canonical tradition holds that failure to condemn manifest heresy compromises ecclesiastical authority. Canon 15 of the First-Second Council praises clergy who cease commemorating heretical bishops, while Apostolic Canon 45 requires suspension for those who "merely join in prayer with heretics."

The theological principle draws from St. Maximus the Confessor's resistance to Monothelitism. Even when all Patriarchs supported the heresy, St. Maximus maintained that communion with heretical hierarchs resulted in gracelessness: "What Mysteries, then, can they perform? Or what spirit will descend upon those who are ordained by them?" The Sixth Ecumenical Council vindicated him, condemning the compromised patriarchs.

Contemporary Orthodox theologians argue that **unrepented Sergianism creates ongoing canonical irregularity**. Without public renunciation of heretical positions, formal condemnation of past teachings, and conciliar validation of repentance, the church remains under the shadow of its compromise. Some argue this affects sacramental validity and apostolic succession, though Orthodox positions vary from "economic" recognition of irregular sacraments to complete "rigorist" rejection.

The international Orthodox response reflects these concerns. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew called Kirill's war support "damaging to the prestige of the whole of Orthodoxy." Over 400 Ukrainian priests called for an international tribunal against Kirill for preaching "heresy" through Russian World doctrine. Baltic Orthodox churches condemned this "highly dangerous ethno-nationalist ideology."

## Conclusion

The Moscow Patriarchate's failure to condemn communism and Sergianism since 1991 represents more than historical oversight - it constitutes ongoing ecclesiological compromise. By venerating collaborators while failing to repudiate subordination to atheist power, then recreating similar patterns with Putin's regime, the church demonstrates what critics call an unbroken chain of Sergianist betrayal.

Orthodox theology teaches that truth, not power, determines canonicity. The theological arguments are clear: without condemning past heretical compromises, the church remains under their influence. The Moscow Patriarchate's continued institutional silence, despite decades of calls for repentance from theologians, clerics, and other Orthodox churches, suggests that the "bitter fruits of sweet captivity" identified by Krakhmalnikova continue to poison Russian Orthodoxy's spiritual authority. Until formal condemnation and repentance occur, the shadow of Sergianism darkens not just Moscow's past, but its present and future.
