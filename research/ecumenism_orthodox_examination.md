Welcome to the Orthodoxy Extended Podcast.
*00:00-00:02*

In this extended podcast, we will be examining the phenomenon and the movement and the dogmas in the contemporary ecumenical movement, what we call ecumenism from an Orthodox perspective.
*00:03-00:20*

God bless.
*00:42-00:43*

Welcome back.
*00:43-00:44*

Glad you're joining us on this Orthodox Ethos Extended Podcast.
*00:44-00:47*

Tonight we are going to be examining the ecumenical movement, in particular, the phenomenon and the religious teachings found in the movement of ecumenism concerning the Body of Christ, the teaching on the Body of Christ, the Incarnation throughout the ages.
*00:48-01:06*

Let's go right into it, and we've got a lot to cover and a lot of questions I'm sure will be examined.
*01:07-01:12*

This is the weekly Tuesday night lecture that we have.
*01:14-01:20*

Every other week we are here presenting the Orthodox teaching, the Patristic teaching, on the book of Revelation.
*01:20-01:26*

And every other week that we are not doing that, we are here and presenting on a variety of topics.
*01:27-01:31*

We have covered a number of topics that are connected and related to tonight's topic.
*01:32-01:37*

Several weeks ago we had an examination of 10 contemporary, heretical, and innovative ideas making their way around the Christian world, but also affecting the Orthodox Church, you'll want to check that out in the Orthodox Ethos YouTube channel.
*01:37-01:54*

For all of those who are following us on Crowdcast or Facebook or whatever the format and platform might be.
*01:55-02:02*

This will continue in that vein, but we'll look particularly at the history, aspects of the history, aspects of the dogma, aspects of the teachings found, And we'll examine them in the light of the patristic teaching and the scriptures.
*02:03-02:17*

And I think everyone will be edified.
*02:18-02:20*

Now, those of you who spent a lot of time already doing research, there will be aspects tonight which are going to be fairly introductory, because we have a very mixed audience, so we'll begin with some basics.
*02:21-02:34*

Nonetheless, we'll look deeply at the spiritual and theological implications of the teachings concerning the body of Christ that are found and adopted by some Orthodox Christians from Orthodox bishops and theologians.
*02:36-02:50*

You can see on the screen symbols that are ubiquitous now in the ecumenical movement, and we have passed the 22nd year of the new century We have passed far away from the original origins and intentions of those Protestants who began the Ecumenical Movement.
*02:52-03:21*

We'll talk about that, but it's important to note that this is a fluid and very fast advancing movement, which is spilling over into all kinds of new ideas all time.
*03:21-03:33*

We did a presentation and we posted a paper on the orthodoxethos.com website concerning the perennialism or the perennial wisdom and the school of philosophy and theology and religious thought called perennialism.
*03:34-03:56*

And we examined that in a conference and posted that.
*03:57-04:00*

So this is also something that you'll be interested in.
*04:00-04:02*

There are a number of other topics, or rather, other papers that we've presented over the years that touch on ecumenism.
*04:02-04:08*

A few of them will be quoted tonight, but there's much more out there.
*04:08-04:12*

So if you did a search, you do a search and look at, put my name and ecumenism or ecumenical movement, or dogma of the church, you're going to run into a number of papers that will be of interest to you if you want to continue on and do some more further research.
*04:12-04:27*

And we talk about especially the question of the boundaries of the church and the mysteries of the church.
*04:27-04:33*

And we'll touch a little bit on that tonight, of course, but for more in-depth research, you'll want to continue on the orthodoxethos.com website, where most, if not all of that has been posted over the years.
*04:34-04:46*

So let's look at the first thing to remember always when we approach such an important topic as which touches on our salvation and the salvation of the We have to be cognizant as Orthodox Christians that we are followers of the Holy Fathers, and only when one follows the Holy Fathers does one come to the truth of the gospel.
*04:47-05:13*

These things are inseparable.
*05:13-05:14*

You want to be a disciple of Christ, you have to be a disciple of the Holy Fathers, a disciple of the saints throughout the ages who Christ has lived and worked through and spoken through again and again and again, and they're a choir of harmonious choir of wisdom that God has inspired for the salvation of the world.
*05:15-05:31*

So it is impossible to come to know the truth or to grasp theology in any other way, but by following the saints, following the holy fathers of the Orthodox church, this is a famous quote will be become a standard here in our presentations as we examine every, every Tuesday examine a contemporary subject like the phenomenon of ecumenism.
*05:31-05:54*

Now, let's begin at the beginning, and let's look at this very briefly and touch on some basic aspects of the dogma of the church before we examine the ecumenism as a dogmatic outlook on the church and on the salvation.
*05:55-06:10*

Remember some basics.
*06:11-06:12*

Now, when we go back to the beginning of the church, the founding of the church, we could talk about different ways about the church and its founding, but it is certainly true to say that the Church began with the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.
*06:13-06:29*

And if you would just read the Scriptures, right there, there is a witness to the order of things that we have to follow if we are going to understand where Christ is and where we need to meet Him in order to be saved.
*06:29-06:41*

And it says in the first verse of chapter 2 of the Acts of the Apostles, "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place." Now that might seem fairly straightforward and basic and almost a given, but it is no longer a given, brothers and sisters.
*06:41-07:04*

It should have been and always should be for every Christian, but it is not.
*07:04-07:08*

Because what is being said here is, the phrase is "epitoaphtho" in Greek, in one place, and that is a phrase used in patristic literature in a way to denote the Eucharistic synaxes.
*07:08-07:26*

So what we have here is two things that are standard and presuppositions for the presence of Christ in His Church, and that is "one accord", which of course means "of one mind and one heart", which means the Orthodox faith.
*07:27-07:42*

It means that they are of one mind in Christ.
*07:43-07:45*

They have the mind of Christ and they are together united in Christ.
*07:45-07:48*

And of course, that means the confession of Jesus Christ and all that that entails.
*07:48-07:52*

There's no division and unity and question of faith.
*07:52-07:55*

There's no disunity here.
*07:56-07:57*

They are one accord.
*07:57-07:58*

And they're in one place, which is of course the Eucharistic synaxis.
*07:59-08:02*

In other words, they're there around where they were holding the divine liturgy and praying and communing with God.
*08:02-08:09*

These two things are inseparable.
*08:09-08:11*

the Orthodox faith and the Orthodox Eucharistic synaxes.
*08:11-08:15*

Where they exist, there is Christ and the Church.
*08:16-08:19*

When either one are missing, there is not Jesus Christ and His Church, the body of Christ, the Eucharist.
*08:19-08:26*

It cannot exist apart from the Orthodox faith, and the Orthodox faith cannot exist as a way and a truth and a life outside of the Eucharistic synaxes, outside of the communion of all of one mind.
*08:26-08:41*

So these things, you might say, well, which goes first?
*08:41-08:44*

Well, it's the cart before the horse.
*08:44-08:46*

Which, those things are inseparable.
*08:46-08:48*

They're two sides of the same coin of the reality of life in Christ.
*08:50-08:53*

So this is where we begin.
*08:53-08:55*

These are the precepts and these are the givens that unfortunately, over the last 500 to a thousand years in the West have been unfortunately doubted or thrown into great disarray in terms of understanding because they have rejected so much of the deposit of faith, and so now we can talk about unity in Christ without any reference to the one faith or any reference to the Eucharist.
*08:55-09:19*

Of course, this is just baseless and delusional.
*09:19-09:26*

This doesn't exist out of what's been revealed and given and passed on throughout the ages.
*09:27-09:31*

And just quickly, one last point on this, and that is they are filled, Having been in one place, with one mind, one heart, one faith, one Lord, one baptism, we're going to see that from the Apostle Paul momentarily, they were filled with the Holy Spirit, and then, of course, they began to speak.
*09:32-09:51*

In other words, to prophesy, to teach, and to preach.
*09:52-09:54*

See, the order of things.
*09:55-09:56*

The one faith, the one Eucharist, the one Spirit bringing forth the preaching of salvation in Christ, and the Spirit speaking through them.
*09:56-10:07*

And without those things, the Spirit, we have no basis to believe or understand that the Spirit is speaking through someone.
*10:08-10:14*

So it is a given from above, the unity that we live and those who do not have it seek, it is not something that can be created in time, it's not a created thing, it's an uncreated reality that one enters into.
*10:14-10:31*

Unity is a given.
*10:32-10:33*

He gives and is given in the church.
*10:34-10:37*

He Himself, Jesus Christ, is the Kingdom of God.
*10:37-10:41*

He Himself is the unity of the body of Christ.
*10:41-10:43*

He's the one in communion that keeps it all together.
*10:43-10:46*

And of course, that's from above.
*10:46-10:48*

It's on high, given to us.
*10:48-10:50*

We ascend in every Eucharist to heaven.
*10:50-10:53*

And there in the internal now, the ever-present today of our Eucharistic life, we have unity, and only there.
*10:54-11:05*

And so, and through there, I should say, unity is found only through Christ in the Eucharist.
*11:06-11:12*

So it's a given.
*11:12-11:13*

It does not say we are seeking it in any place.
*11:13-11:16*

No one has ever said that we can seek, in other words, to find, to create, as if we, when you lose it, you cannot recreate it, you cannot fashion it anew between human beings, it is a given.
*11:16-11:30*

So there is, according to St.
*11:30-11:32*

Paul, one body, the Church, the body of Christ.
*11:32-11:35*

One Spirit, the Holy Spirit, which descended at Pentecost.
*11:35-11:41*

Even as you're called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all, and in you all, He is the unity of all the believers.
*11:41-11:55*

So that unity is not something that's invisible, but it's quite manifest.
*11:55-12:03*

And it must be manifest, because that is the implications and the reality of the Incarnation, that He came, but He did not abandon us.
*12:04-12:13*

He will be with us, He says, throughout the ages.
*12:14-12:17*

Right?
*12:17-12:17*

He is present with us.
*12:17-12:19*

"Go therefore," He says, "and teach all nations," that should be make disciples of all nations.
*12:20-12:24*

"baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them, having them..." They have been made disciples, which is the whole process of the catechumenate, purification, baptism, death and resurrection, communion, uniting themselves to Christ.
*12:26-12:41*

They become disciples in that process, and then they are taught all things, to observe all things, all the commandments.
*12:41-12:48*

In that context, again, in that context, our life in Christ is led and enjoyed and understood.
*12:48-12:56*

These are the givens.
*12:56-12:57*

He gives and is given in the mystery of the church and in the mysteries.
*12:58-13:02*

It's He who is imparted.
*13:03-13:04*

Whenever you say one person is baptized, that immediately means the church.
*13:04-13:09*

It immediately means Christ.
*13:09-13:10*

There's no such thing as a mystery, a sacrament, outside of the mystery, the sacrament of the church.
*13:11-13:18*

Those things are the same thing.
*13:19-13:21*

They are the manifestation of the church.
*13:21-13:23*

St. Nicholas Kavazla says the Church is known in the mysteries, so it is not possible to know the Church, the Body of Christ, Christ Himself, outside of the mysteries.
*13:23-13:34*

The mysteries of the Church are in the self.
*13:35-13:37*

Anyone who speaks about one being baptized or communing outside of the Pentecost, right, what we just said, first the faith, the Eucharistic assembly, Anybody who says, well, outside of that, there is Christ gives Himself and is given.
*13:37-13:54*

Then they have confused and they've departed from the very basics here of the scriptures.
*13:56-14:01*

It's a given, and in that context, we become disciples.
*14:02-14:05*

In that context, we're taught.
*14:05-14:06*

In that context, we are able to carry out all of the commandments by the grace of God.
*14:06-14:11*

"Teach them all things," He says, "whatsoever I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world." He is with us always.
*14:12-14:19*

The Incarnation continues.
*14:19-14:21*

He did not come and leave.
*14:23-14:24*

He took us with Him into heaven, and He returned again on Pentecost, and He dwells in His body, the Church.
*14:25-14:32*

He is the Church.
*14:32-14:34*

He is the Church.
*14:34-14:35*

It's not that He has us, or that we are the Church, but He is the Church, and we are His members, because the Church is the body of Christ.
*14:35-14:44*

These things are inseparable.
*14:45-14:46*

They're impossible to be understood in parts, in pieces, piecemeal.
*14:46-14:53*

It has to be understood all together.
*14:53-14:56*

This is the nature of unity in Christ.
*14:56-15:00*

You cannot divide these things, you cannot disintegrate them.
*15:00-15:04*

There's no way to be partially in Christ.
*15:04-15:09*

There's no way to be partially pregnant.
*15:10-15:11*

This is the phrase I use to drive home the absurdity of talking about a partial communion or a partial participation.
*15:12-15:24*

Either you're in the body of Christ, members made so by the mysteries, or you are not.
*15:25-15:32*

Now you can be a follower of Christ.
*15:33-15:35*

You can strive to love him with all your heart, soul, and mind, but the actualization of membership and dying and rising is not something that you or I or any human being can actualize on his own.
*15:35-15:51*

Again, it is a given that we have to enter into.
*15:53-15:55*

It is a revelation that we have to accept and embrace, and we have to submit ourselves in time and space, here and not there.
*15:56-16:04*

Christ came in a town in Palestine, in Bethlehem, in a particular place, to a particular virgin, Mary, in a particular time.
*16:04-16:14*

And that same incarnation in reality is true throughout the ages, that the Church is here in a particular time and space.
*16:15-16:22*

Why is it so important that the Churches be built, that the altars be erected, that people attend the Temple of God, if it doesn't matter, and we can relativize it and talk about partial participation and partial communion, and all the rest, which is what is so predominant in the ecumenical movement today and ecumenism.
*16:23-16:42*

And all of that is a confession on the part of the enthusiast of ecumenism that they don't have the revelation, the given, that which is passed down.
*16:42-16:53*

The fact that they have to seek it, the fact that they feel that they are only partially participating in it, that they have a disintegration of the reality of the incarnation means that they're confessing they don't have it.
*16:53-17:03*

A reformation is not necessary for that which is, and always is, and is present.
*17:04-17:10*

We don't need to reform anything that Christ has revealed, and He has promised that He will guide and be with us into the end.
*17:10-17:16*

That's the test that this is true, that it's the same Christ throughout the ages, yesterday, today, and forever.
*17:16-17:23*

The same Christ.
*17:23-17:23*

That Christ is the body of Christ.
*17:24-17:26*

That's some other Christ.
*17:26-17:27*

People in the Western world say, "I am a disciple of Christ," but not of the Orthodox Church or of the one Church or the Body of Christ.
*17:27-17:34*

And that is impossible.
*17:35-17:36*

That's not according to his revelation.
*17:36-17:38*

That's not according to 2000 years of church tradition.
*17:38-17:40*

There are unfortunately many sincerely held, sincere Christians, people who are trying to follow Christ, in that sense, being a Christian, because of course, to be a Christian truly is to put him on in the mysteries, right?
*17:41-17:54*

It's to, it's to dialyze in the, in the mysteries, but there are many who seek after him.
*17:54-17:59*

And but they stumble on this particular scandal of the particular, this scandal of the particular, right?
*18:00-18:08*

That it's here, not there.
*18:08-18:09*

That is this and not that.
*18:09-18:10*

That it's in time and in place.
*18:10-18:12*

And you have to submit yourself to that.
*18:12-18:14*

This is something for the rationalist that is very difficult to embrace.
*18:14-18:18*

And they do not like, they do not answer with, as Peter did.
*18:19-18:24*

Where shall we go, Lord?
*18:25-18:26*

You have the words of life.
*18:26-18:27*

But they turn around and they say, this is a hard saying.
*18:27-18:29*

It's a hard saying that I have to eat the body and drink the blood of the incarnate Lord.
*18:29-18:36*

This really hands-on particular material and spiritual reality.
*18:37-18:44*

And the rationalist and the Gnostic and different versions of delusion, because behind it is pride and not wanting to submit, that's the common denominator of all those who reject the incarnation is pride, and I want to submit their intellect and say that my intellect cannot understand this mystery.
*18:45-19:04*

I submit to it.
*19:05-19:06*

Peter said, I don't, did Peter understand the mystery of the Eucharist when the Lord suddenly turned to his disciples and said, you must eat my body and drink my blood, do you think that Peter rationally understood his rational intellect was able to grasp that?
*19:06-19:20*

Of course not.
*19:20-19:21*

It's a mystery, but he crucified his intellect.
*19:21-19:24*

Because he trusted the master.
*19:26-19:28*

And on this particular doctrine today, we have many, many, many people who cannot do that, refuse to do that.
*19:29-19:35*

They don't want to crucify their infant.
*19:36-19:37*

And the hard saying that the church is here and not there, it's in time and space.
*19:37-19:42*

It has an identity, it has a faith, it has a rule.
*19:42-19:44*

It is a continuation from 2000 years and all the rest that's implied in this doctrine.
*19:45-19:49*

So in the scriptures, we have it right there.
*19:49-19:52*

It's obvious, and it's a given, and it's not even, of course, need to be developed.
*19:53-19:58*

It's just obvious.
*19:58-19:59*

He gives, and he is given.
*20:00-20:01*

Now, let's turn-- it's a very, very brief-- we'll come back to a lot of these themes as we go on-- but very brief introduction, just to remind us of things we should know already.
*20:01-20:12*

If we're Orthodox Christians, we should be well acquainted with this teaching.
*20:12-20:16*

And let's talk now, what is this ecumenism?
*20:16-20:19*

And we'll just start from the beginning with the words of those who are presenting it in a positive light.
*20:20-20:25*

And then we'll look at it from the patristic teaching among some of the saints today who directly addressed the question of ecumenism.
*20:26-20:33*

Ecumenism, and these are just, there's a number of these kinds of definitions floating around online.
*20:36-20:41*

It's very simple and easy to find.
*20:42-20:43*

So, something special here just to remind us.
*20:43-20:46*

Ecumenism is of course from the Greek term "Ecumeni" meaning the inhabited world.
*20:47-20:52*

It's a very good term used for the ecumenical councils and the ecumenical patriarchy and all these.
*20:52-20:57*

These are things that go back at least to the 4th century and the beginning of the embrace of the Romans, embracing the Church and Christ and then the Roman Empire eventually becoming identified as Christian with Theodosius in 382, and so now the whole inhabited world, that means the Ecumene, the Roman Empire, essentially, to a certain degree, is the ecumenical field for the Church.
*20:57-21:33*

It's the place where the Church now is being established and built up and all the rest, so this is the term goes back and then we have eventually the ecumenical patriarchate means.
*21:33-21:43*

He's the patriarch where the throne of the Roman emperor was, Constantinople, and he has the term as well, which has been disputed actually by some because of the implications that he is somehow over the other bishops, something that eventually the Pope will take up and make into a dogma.
*21:44-22:02*

And essentially through that stance, brought about the disintegration of church unity, walked away from the church and exalting himself over the other bishops, which was an anathema to previous popes.
*22:03-22:17*

But now I'm on a tangent.
*22:18-22:19*

Let's get back.
*22:19-22:20*

Humanism came to prominence in the 20th century as a coalition of like-minded groups seeking to restore religious communion, fellowship, communion, the same thing, that had been lost with the fragmentation of the church into different groups.
*22:20-22:34*

That's one definition, one description flowing around online.
*22:34-22:37*

So immediately we see a different perception of the church, that the church can be fragmented.
*22:37-22:44*

Therefore, we're not talking at this point about the body of Christ, which is a divine human organism, of course, can never be fragmented.
*22:45-22:52*

That would be the end of it as the divine human organism.
*22:53-22:56*

So the Lord said very clearly that the gates of hell will not prevail against my church.
*22:56-23:02*

And so division of the church is impossible, only departure from the church.
*23:02-23:06*

Division is impossible according to its nature.
*23:06-23:08*

It's not a question of history or people, it's according to God's promises and His revelation of what this is, this Church.
*23:09-23:17*

What is this Church?
*23:17-23:18*

It's a divine human organism.
*23:18-23:19*

So, immediately we have a heretical view, essentially, a departure from Christian teaching, that the Church can be fragmented at all, is impossible.
*23:19-23:27*

Christ cannot be fragmented.
*23:28-23:29*

Is Christ divided?
*23:30-23:32*

St.
*23:32-23:32*

Paul famously said, "Is Christ divided?" No, of course not.
*23:33-23:35*

So the fact that we're restoring communion that have been lost means we're talking about something other than the body of Christ.
*23:35-23:43*

We're not, we're talking about people who walked away from the body of Christ and them seeking to be in communion with one another and, and, uh, also with the church.
*23:43-23:52*

And then the whole question of how that comes about, which we're not going to get too much into tonight, which is a very important part of this discussion, but it's probably beyond the payoff for tonight.
*23:53-24:02*

That comes to play.
*24:04-24:05*

But the very idea that we've lost communion, that we're all in the church, and the church is fragmented, that whole idea, of course, is impossible to reconcile with the revelation of Jesus Christ.
*24:05-24:17*

Another attempt at describing, defining the ecumenical movement, it's that it seeks to recover the apostolic sense of the early church for unity and diversity.
*24:19-24:30*

Again, something's been lost in apostolic understanding of unity and diversity in the early church's experience, and we need to recover that.
*24:30-24:40*

Again, something that by definition of what the church is, is impossible.
*24:40-24:47*

If we're talking about the apostolic faith and church being in need of being restored and recovered, that's not the case, what needs to be, what needs to happen is people need to re-enter or enter and submit themselves to this reality which exists and is immutable and cannot be divided.
*24:48-25:10*

Again, humanism in the movement is the movement to restore unity among the Christian churches and throughout the whole world.
*25:11-25:18*

And so that's interesting because the second part points us now a little bit beyond the church, doesn't it?
*25:19-25:24*

And I think that's where we're at now after 130, 40 years, depending on when you want to date the beginning of this modern movement, 1910, 1920, probably really in the late 1800s, as you'll see.
*25:25-25:39*

In any case, now we're moving beyond the Christian church and we're talking about the whole world being united, which is the question entirely, isn't it?
*25:41-25:49*

But we practice by, it says here, we practice this ecumenism by praying together.
*25:50-25:56*

We'll look at that.
*25:57-25:57*

We'll look at what does the Church Fathers say about praying together with those who are not in the body of Christ.
*25:58-26:02*

"In the community together, and honestly searching for God's truth together." So all of these definitions point to someone, groups of people who've lost their way, who've lost the revelation or the given, the unity that's given.
*26:03-26:16*

They've walked away from it, or they've been, they've been taken away from it.
*26:16-26:19*

They've been deceived.
*26:19-26:20*

Well, however you want to describe it.
*26:20-26:23*

But so the common perception here, forgive me for the little distraction.
*26:23-26:44*

The common perception here is that we've lost something and we're trying to recover it.
*26:45-26:50*

That is not the case in terms of Christ.
*26:50-26:55*

Christ is not lost.
*26:55-26:56*

He has not lost his people.
*26:56-26:57*

The people have not lost him.
*26:57-26:58*

Uh, in other words, his body, his members of his body, that's impossible.
*26:59-27:02*

Uh, but people can certainly walk away from it.
*27:03-27:06*

And that's happened repeatedly throughout church history.
*27:06-27:08*

Now let's look quickly based on, uh, at the, at the modern, uh, origins, the missionary origins of modern ecumenism.
*27:08-27:16*

Uh, this is taken from a book that I've written.
*27:17-27:18*

We'll talk about that at the end of this little section.
*27:18-27:21*

You can get that online or even download it.
*27:22-27:25*

I think it's for free online.
*27:25-27:26*

It's also for sale as a book.
*27:26-27:27*

And we're gonna go quickly through the basic, real basic, you know, just excerpts to reorient, to order ourselves where this come from and where was it established in what context and what perspective to better understand why it is what it is, and how it differs from the Orthodox Church.
*27:29-27:50*

So it really begins in the 19th century.
*27:50-27:53*

And the 19th century missionary movement in the Protestant world, which was phenomenal in terms of scope.
*27:56-28:03*

Right?
*28:04-28:04*

There was a massive missionary movement in the 1800s all across the world, following the colonizers of England and America and different European states, the missionaries who would go behind and with and in large measure supported by the colonialists.
*28:04-28:24*

And they made tremendous strides in bringing their confessional teaching and preaching to people all through Africa and South America and other places.
*28:25-28:38*

So there was a global vision of mission.
*28:38-28:41*

And it set the stage for our 20th century, that we're calling the ecumenical century to follow.
*28:42-28:48*

Really, it's important to understand it, otherwise you couldn't have had an ecumenical century, an ecumenical movement in the 20th century.
*28:49-28:54*

It took Protestantism out of its isolation in the West, and it brought it face to face, both with cultures, peoples, and faiths around the world, and with its own divisions.
*28:55-29:03*

This is the most important thing.
*29:04-29:05*

It came, had to come to term with its own divisions, reflected in the denominational chaos which was transplanted to the mission field.
*29:05-29:14*

So the missionaries were saying, "Whoa, wait a minute, we can't do mission when we're 14 different groups in Zaire or wherever in Africa." And the people were saying to us in the commission, "What are you, what are you Christians and why aren't you together?
*29:15-29:28*

And which Christian should I become?" All the rest.
*29:28-29:31*

The implications of our division now, which had grown steadily since the Reformation began in many different groups.
*29:31-29:38*

That was on full display in the mission field.
*29:38-29:41*

Secondly, the missionary movement went hand in hand, as I said, with colonial and economic expansion.
*29:43-29:49*

In this way, the worldwide spread of Protestantism is seen to be an important factor in the first stages of the process of globalization, which has been built upon the common language and culture of Protestant West.
*29:50-30:01*

So to understand this phenomena, we're living in full throttle today.
*30:02-30:08*

This new world order, this one world government that people want to establish, the process of globalization and the fruit of globalization, it actually could not really have taken off and existed without Protestant missionary work throughout the world, because that's the common language and culture upon which globalization was based.
*30:08-30:30*

the English language in the Protestant West of America and England means.
*30:30-30:34*

Of course, technology and all the rest sped it up even greater, but it really does begin on the tales of the colonialists and the missionaries throughout the world.
*30:36-30:49*

So the Protestant missionary enterprise served as the springboard of the ecumenical movement, prepared the ground for the arrival of the ecumenical century and the move from a missionary to an ecumenical ecclesiology.
*30:50-31:01*

So step two now, milestone two, we have the evangelical ecclesiology, the invisible church that was developed in earnest among the missionaries and the Protestant theologians at the end of the 19th century, the beginning of the 20th century, they were united in evangelical experience through the missionary societies, societies which were multi-denominational, In spite of, or in indifference to, dogmatic differences were not an obstacle for their unity.
*31:02-31:33*

The unity of the evangelicals can rightly be said to be one of the first expressions of the contemporary ecumenical spirit.
*31:34-31:39*

As was written by T.V.
*31:40-31:43*

Philip, they shared an experience that marked them off decisively from all others and gathered them together in the fellowship of an invisible church of Christ to which all vital, quote unquote, "vital" Christians belonged.
*31:43-31:57*

There's a real phenomenon.
*31:58-31:59*

This is really a new phenomenon in 19th century, early 20th century among Protestants, uh, grew, uh, you know, tremendously in 20th century as well as evangelicals throughout denominations.
*31:59-32:08*

And it, and it's, it's a catalyst for doing away with denominational divisions and of course, essentially becoming less and less sensitive to any kind of doctrinal implications in one's life, like what does doctrine dogma have to do with our life when we all feel we're already united anyway so maybe dogma is really not necessary right it was not a matter of the experience was not a matter of theological reflection but rather of general experiential crisis so they came up and it was embraced this idea that theologies could divide if theologies could divide and that was the experience of Protestant for hundreds of years and of course with with Catholicism well experience could unite. So this was a liberating, you know, in quote unquote liberating time for a lot of Protestant Christians. They felt that there was just so much expectation from this mission endeavor and so many fruits had come quickly to restore a kind of unity on the ground among Protestants, which they did not have of course through wars and divisions and schisms that had growing and steadfastness of the formation.
*32:09-33:15*

So, this evangelical ecclesiology, as we said, that said that experience is paramount, it came to bring an end to the denominational walls, and Christian unity came to be based on a subjective experience.
*33:17-33:36*

This is very important.
*33:37-33:38*

Christian unity based on subjective experience, divorce from theological truth, the theological dogma.
*33:38-33:45*

Okay.
*33:45-33:46*

This meant that the visions of a doctrinal or ecclesiological nature would be overlooked for the sake of an unclear ideal of quote Christianity.
*33:46-33:55*

And what does that mean exactly?
*33:55-33:57*

It's not so it's an experience.
*33:57-33:58*

So we don't have to define things and just let's move on because we have a lot of work to do in the mission field in this way, the unity of theology and experience life and truth will rent asunder the door was flung open to the creation of a church within and transcending the churches, a church within and transcending the Protestant denominations, a kind of super but invisible church made up of all vital Christians possessing special traits.
*33:58-34:25*

That was very encouraging, probably very full of pride, right?
*34:26-34:30*

I'm special, and they don't have what I have.
*34:30-34:33*

We're special people, we're special missionaries, we're special experiences, and special knowledge.
*34:33-34:39*

So this is part two.
*34:39-34:41*

Now we go to milestone three.
*34:41-34:43*

End of the 19th century.
*34:43-34:45*

This is very general, of course, we're just talking about general themes, general approaches here, and very from a thousand feet up, but giving you a sense of this historical process, which brought about the birth of the ecumenical movement.
*34:45-34:58*

What we see developing out of those same missionaries and those missionary societies, there are other things like the YMCA, very big in the early 1900s, and the student Christian movements, very important to especially European Christian, Protestant Christians, inspiration of the ecumenical generation. These were the future leaders of the ecumenical movement. They were coming from these movements and they're very important in the development of the future ecumenical movement. So there were student movements all over the place, in many lands, and they had coalesced in the World Student Christian Federation, John Mott, the famous John Mott, if you know a little bit about Protestant missionary history in the early 20th century, the symbol and prophet of the transition from evangelicalism to ecumenism, and the man responsible for the Federation, he wrote the following the day after its foundation. So the day after they start this Student Christian Federation, all these different groups, and they're very excited, he says the following, and here on the left you can see a picture of him as a young man and then as an old man he lived from 1865 to 1955 and it's very interesting that underneath his in this memoriam of course is the famous term a phrase that they're gonna take from the Gospel of John and they're gonna use in the ecumenical movement that they all may be one now we could talk about that unfortunately their interpretation of it is not patristic it's not understood not as we understand the Orthodox Church and as Church fathers understood it and unfortunately Orthodox leaders have brought into this idea, that this is a prayer of our Lord Himself for the kind of unity to be sought and found that we said is a given. So this is a given unity by God to His disciples. It's a unity in theosis, essentially, right? For them to be united in God. That's the prayer of His disciples.
*35:00-36:56*

So it's a given unity to the body of Christ and not something that is to be found among those who have departed from the body of Christ, as if, and separate from the body of Christ, as if one can create that outside of the continuation of the Incarnation, which is the Church.
*36:57-37:16*

He said, "The Federation will unite in spirit the students of the world, and in doing this it will be achieving a yet more significant result, the hastening of the answer to our Lord's prayer, that they all may be one.
*37:18-37:33*

You see the interpretation here, not the patricic interpretation.
*37:33-37:36*

In doing this, it will be achieving, we're going to achieve this.
*37:38-37:44*

We're going to make this reality through our student movements and our missionary societies.
*37:44-37:47*

We're going to bring this about as if it's something that needs to be created.
*37:47-37:51*

It doesn't exist.
*37:51-37:52*

It's a given.
*37:53-37:54*

But as we said from Pentecost on, it's very clear in the day of Pentecost that it was given from on high, to a identifiable body in time and space, and passed on through the Church's holy tradition and ordination and the Orthodox faith.
*37:54-38:10*

Right?
*38:10-38:11*

So this is the patristic understanding of our unity.
*38:11-38:13*

No, we're going to work to hasten the answer to our Lord's prayer.
*38:14-38:19*

We're going to answer the Lord's prayer as if that's something that is achieved by human beings, that they may be one.
*38:19-38:26*

Surely there has been no more hopeful development towards a real spiritual union of Christendom than the Federation.
*38:26-38:33*

So he's saying that, look, our Federation is the greatest hope on the face of the earth for Christian unity right now, which unites in common purpose and work the coming leaders of the church and state in all lands.
*38:33-38:43*

So really heady stuff.
*38:44-38:45*

And this is the way it is in the Protestant.
*38:45-38:47*

Anybody who's been a Protestant, has been active in activism and, you know, the words of the pro-life movement or missionary work, it's very heady.
*38:47-38:54*

It's very optimistic, very activist.
*38:54-38:58*

We're going to do this.
*38:59-38:59*

We're going to take this.
*39:00-39:00*

We're going to get it done.
*39:00-39:01*

And that's how it was over 100 years ago in the student Christian movements.
*39:02-39:09*

Now, we go on.
*39:10-39:11*

Another aspect, another little thought about this, just to fill in the blank.
*39:11-39:16*

A ecumenical historian who also worked with Mott wrote the following.
*39:20-39:23*

What was the new ecumenical idea, a new innovative idea here that's new, that hasn't been thought about, which the student Christian movement was destined to introduce to the Church?
*39:24-39:34*

It was the idea of a new type of Christian organization, a new conception of the basis on which Christians belonging to different churches might unite to win the world for Christ.
*39:35-39:45*

So we have this new conception of how we're going to do mission, right?
*39:48-39:55*

On an interdenominational rather than an undenominational basis.
*39:56-40:00*

We have a new thing in church history, according to the Protestants here, that we're going to have a, essentially, remember, in and transcending the denominations, we've achieved a new unity that's never been seen before.
*40:01-40:12*

And it's going to win the world for Christ.
*40:13-40:14*

So, the ecumenical movement was always tied to mission.
*40:14-40:19*

It's always tied to a goal of reaching out to the non-Christians, okay?
*40:20-40:26*

That's the context of the ecumenical movement in the Protestant world, and the Orthodox just accepted that as a given.
*40:26-40:31*

It was a movement which started with the belief that they shared the life in Christ.
*40:32-40:36*

We start with, we're already united.
*40:36-40:38*

That's where we start.
*40:39-40:39*

We share the life in Christ with fellow believers.
*40:40-40:41*

And it recognized the believers' allegiance Christian bodies, into which, as they thought, the body of Christ is divided." So again, the context here, entirely a foreign ecclesiology to the then 1,900 year old, you know, reality of Pentecost on earth, something that's, it's, it's, it's an innovation, as she says, it's a new idea.
*40:42-41:09*

And it's about bringing to end the division of Christ.
*41:10-41:17*

Christ is divided.
*41:18-41:19*

Apparently they believe when Paul asked that, he was asking for an answer.
*41:20-41:25*

It was a rhetorical question, of course, in the epistle of the apostle.
*41:25-41:29*

Is Christ divided?
*41:29-41:30*

No, of course he's not divided.
*41:30-41:31*

He cannot be divided.
*41:31-41:32*

The student Christian movements became the link that would carry the evangelical ecclesiology beyond the narrow confines of evangelicalism.
*41:33-41:41*

You see, this is very consistent with the history of Protestantism, is that you have the various movements and developments that one kind of leads into another and morphs into something different.
*41:42-41:54*

And there's just a constant movement and development and morphing of their Christian experience.
*41:55-42:00*

And they believe this is good. They believe this is what should happen.
*42:00-42:03*

We should constantly be changing, innovating, and finding, and reforming, and finding something new and different.
*42:03-42:09*

But from an Orthodox perspective, it's extremely problematic and does not witness to the given, which is the revelation and the continuation of the incarnation.
*42:10-42:18*

So it's non-doctrinal, non-ecclesial, non-sacramental.
*42:19-42:24*

The student movements, ironically, at once signaled the disintegration of the Western confessions and the reintegration.
*42:25-42:33*

but in a non-ecclesial way.
*42:33-42:35*

So they believe they are actually getting closer to an ecclesial reality and unity manifest, but in my analysis, at least, I would posit that it's a new kind of unity which is non-ecclesial.
*42:36-42:50*

In other words, they are stepping away.
*42:51-42:52*

They are not stepping toward church unity.
*42:53-42:55*

They sought Catholicity, but only horizontally, not vertically, Not diachronically.
*42:56-43:04*

Okay.
*43:04-43:04*

Catholicity means "duplirum ecclesiastes", right?
*43:05-43:09*

Fullness.
*43:09-43:10*

And that fullness, because it's Christ, is only full.
*43:10-43:13*

It's not talking about a quantity.
*43:13-43:16*

It's actually talking about the nature of Christ, right?
*43:16-43:20*

The nature of the Church.
*43:20-43:21*

It's always full.
*43:22-43:23*

And it's only full.
*43:24-43:25*

And only in Christ is it full.
*43:25-43:27*

So, Catholicism is again something that is a given, it's the nature of the church, there's the whole truth and the whole experience, the truth, the way, and the life without discounts, right, it's all there.
*43:28-43:43*

They sought that, that unity, that Catholicism, they sought only on the plane of history amongst themselves in time, they didn't seek it vertically, in other words, immediately with an "in Christ" in the revelation that has been given, and they didn't seek it diachronically, in other words, they didn't go back to Church history.
*43:44-44:09*

They didn't try to follow the Holy Fathers.
*44:09-44:10*

That was not a part of what needed to happen.
*44:11-44:13*

We didn't, there was no discussion.
*44:13-44:14*

We have to, to have unity, they didn't say we have to follow the Holy Fathers.
*44:14-44:18*

That was not part of the discussion.
*44:18-44:19*

We have to achieve unity, we have to create unity, we have to work toward unity.
*44:20-44:24*

Following the Holy Father as a necessary prerequisite and presupposition for unity was not on the table.
*44:25-44:31*

Now, milestone four, Edinburgh 1910, the cradle of modern ecumenism.
*44:32-44:38*

1910, the world missionary conference in Edinburgh, the confessed by all, the beginning really, in earnest, of the modern ecumenical movement.
*44:38-44:50*

It was the first conference which sought to be inclusive of a wide range of Protestant confessions, not just evangelicals.
*44:50-44:55*

So now the evangelicals were the spearhead, let's say, now it's going to the mainline Protestants, to the Methodists, to the Anglicans, to the whatever.
*44:55-45:04*

Out of it grew the movements which would emerge to form the World Council of Churches.
*45:05-45:09*

In 1948, the International Missionary Council, which became the mission and evangelism arm of the WCC in 1961.
*45:09-45:15*

(an order also was going on and developing immediately after this)
*45:16-45:23*

convinced that God was calling them to world evangelization, the Edinburgh delegates saw church divisions as a mission weakness, and unity and mission as a divine imperative.
*45:23-45:34*

It's always in the context of achieving success in the missionary field.
*45:34-45:39*

So there's no discussion here of doctrinal unity.
*45:39-45:43*

That doesn't really happen in need for the doctrinal unity, right?
*45:43-45:46*

Nobody's saying this is a prerequisite, doctrinal use is a prerequisite.
*45:46-45:49*

That comes along basically with the involvement of the Orthodox in the 1920s, and nothing really is achieved by the Orthodox.
*45:49-45:57*

There may be no voice that is never really considered until this day.
*45:57-46:02*

I mean, yes, yes, lip service, yes, many praiseworthy things, and we're so grateful, but how much has really been achieved to bring evangelicals, Protestants, anywhere close to the historic faith has been revealed and passed on by the church fathers.
*46:02-46:19*

Uh, it's very hard to see how that's, uh, been successful at all here and there.
*46:19-46:24*

There are people who have first ever warmed to theological ideas, but that doesn't mean conversion.
*46:24-46:29*

That doesn't mean pen doesn't mean true unity in Christ.
*46:30-46:34*

That means, uh, again, horizontal plane.
*46:34-46:37*

we have a alpha unity, you know, human unity, which is very fragile.
*46:37-46:46*

A united and renewed church.
*46:48-46:50*

This is what they, they thought a united and renewed church outfitted for a universal mission and service moving beyond its borders, uniting the entire ecumenical, entire world.
*46:50-46:59*

This is the new dream that stirred men to performing the incredible drama of Edinburgh and the modern ecumenical movement.
*47:00-47:06*

The dream is that they are going to achieve it.
*47:06-47:09*

It's just filled with optimism.
*47:09-47:12*

It is a dream of eschatological implications.
*47:12-47:14*

It was said, of course.
*47:15-47:16*

And they are quite correct to see in it a strange inversion of the Christian church which had hitherto existed.
*47:17-47:23*

Remember what we said?
*47:23-47:24*

Something new.
*47:25-47:25*

It's not the church that was revealed.
*47:25-47:27*

It's something new.
*47:27-47:28*

They're trying to achieve in a different way, in a different plane, and with different givens, not theological and doctrinal unity.
*47:28-47:35*

In a different way, we're going to have unity.
*47:36-47:37*

"At Edinburgh the wall of doctrine began to fall, and in their place were erected the belief that differences would be transcended without being surrendered." Differences would be transcended without being surrendered.
*47:37-47:52*

It's like a magic show of sorts.
*47:53-47:55*

"After Edinburgh, the Orthodox would soon enter the scene and be forced to work within such a framework and mindset that did not allow for orthodox ecclesiological presuppositions.
*47:57-48:08*

All right.
*48:08-48:08*

So now the last and final Muslim, this part of church, of the history, we're not going to go continue on in the twenties, thirties, forties, fifties.
*48:08-48:16*

We're not going to go through the whole history of the ecumenical movement because really after the twenties and after the encyclical that was issued by the ecumenical patriarchate, then things, there's a trajectory that's followed and pretty much it continues in that all the way up to today with some very important events like the Second Vatican Council and other major events that push the ecumenical movement further on toward a unity, but not again, a unity that's in turn like the prodigal going back to the father or the submission of the rationalist to the mystery and therefore a initiation, crucifixion of the mind, that kind of thing is not happening agreements on levels, we're gonna admit that we're already there. The Orthodox will from 20 on, as I'll say in a minute, we'll talk about the 1920 in cyclical now, but what has happened among the ecumenists who've succumbed to this mentality and this outlook is that they've said, they've given in to the basic presuppositions of the ecumenical movement that laid down by the early fathers hear of them of their kind of woman that is that we already have you right and that's what the second Vatican Council will say they'll say we're unified it's just not full we have a partial and they'll say eventually that it's anathema to talk about a humanism of return what do they mean no one's gonna have to return to someone else we're all returning to Christ because we're all divided okay that's that's the new doctrine the new dogma never taught among the disciples of Christ in his church, the Orthodox Church, for the last 2,000 years. It's a new idea which is very much consistent with what we just talked about in evangelical ecclesiology and then the ecumenical ecclesiology coming out of that. It's totally consistent with that and totally inconsistent with the Orthodox Christian Church. Fortunately, it didn't take long for John Mott and his friends from the various student movements to go to and go to Constantinople in 1910, there was a big meeting there.
*48:16-50:27*

And very quickly among the leaders of, uh, some leaders in the Ecumenical Patriarchate, unfortunately, including the two you see here on the screen, Metropolitan Germanos, uh, Strinopoulos of Theatira, he was the first bishop in England for the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
*50:28-50:43*

Uh, and, uh, and then there was the Patriarch Germanos, uh, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople from 1913 to 1918, he died in 1920.
*50:44-50:52*

He is said to have, along with I think Germanos, I think he played a role, is he's the author of this encyclical.
*50:53-51:00*

It's called "To the Churches of Christ Everywhere" "Abandonho Ecclesiastes do Cristo" So the term, of course, that we want to pay attention to here is church.
*51:02-51:13*

The term is used in this encyclical in a way that the Orthodox had never used it before.
*51:15-51:20*

In fact, just a few years before, in the 1890s, and then before that, about 40 years before, in the 1850s, the Orthodox Patriarchs of Constantinople and other bishops, the first one was from the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch, they issued a letter to the Pope of Rome and clearly said that there's only one Church, that there can be only one Church, that's the nature of the body of Christ, that the unity of everything is very consistent with patrician teaching. So now this author and this encyclical which comes out in 1920, which is actually during a time when there was no patriarch, they were waiting I guess to elect the patriarch, but there was no patriarch at the time, it was a locum tenens as they call it, somebody was sitting in the place of the patriarch until the election, and the issue of this encyclical and it has As a new consideration of the Church, and it was being urged upon the Churches, for a new consideration, using this phrase from Ephesians to describe the various non-Orthodox heterosexual churches and the one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church in the same phrase, apparently in the same meaning.
*51:20-52:41*

That they should no more consider one another as strangers and foreigners, but as the relatives, and as being part of the household of Christ, and fairs, and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise of God in Christ." And that phrase, "members of the same body," is now applied in this encyclical.
*52:42-53:01*

And Metropolitan Gimeno writes about this encyclical, praising it, the following, which gives us, it's very clear that that's how they understand it.
*53:02-53:11*

That this is not some mistaken understanding or something.
*53:11-53:14*

that they understand it in an ecclesiological sense.
*53:14-53:17*

We're talking about the church in a different way.
*53:17-53:19*

And he says, "How wide the conception is, which the encyclical teaches at this point, becomes clear in that it widens the notion of the relationships between the members of a single church." Hmm, this is written to non-Orthodox churches.
*53:19-53:34*

It is to the quote-unquote churches of Christ everywhere.
*53:35-53:37*

So now you have a clear reference to members, relationships between members of a single Church, which Church is that exactly, we don't have the same communion, we don't have the same faith, but as members of one body, according to St.
*53:37-53:53*

Paul's wonderful teaching, so as to apply it to the relationships between several Churches.
*53:53-53:59*

Now, it's clearly not in the context of the Orthodox local Churches.
*53:59-54:05*

Some might say, well, maybe he's talking about the local Orthodox Churches.
*54:05-54:08*

In other words, the Church of Greece, the Church of Romania, the Church of Bulgaria, no, this is not sent to them only, mainly it's obviously an ecumenical tool, and it's celebrated to this day, they said the 100th anniversary two years ago, and it's clearly celebrated as an ecumenical, in other words, for the ecumenical movement among the heterodox churches.
*54:08-54:28*

So there's no, I don't think there's any room here for misunderstanding.
*54:28-54:31*

This is a major shift on the part of some people in the ecumenical patriarchy to depart from the Orthodox understanding and to embrace what we just presented, which was an evangelical Protestant understanding of the Church.
*54:32-54:45*

And of course, the only thing that happens is that people walk away from the Fathers with catastrophic consequences, and it doesn't really change anything in terms of the Church.
*54:46-54:57*

The Church is, again, a given, it's a revelation, we enter into that, and we follow the Holy Fathers.
*54:58-55:03*

we don't create new ideas and new movements to change what has been revealed by God.
*55:03-55:12*

In widening the notion of the Church to include bodies neither ecclesiastically, sacramentally, or dogmatically in communion with the Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Germanos, or Patriarch Germanos, is in perfect harmony, both with the foregoing evangelical ecclesiology, which speaks of a fellowship of an invisible Church of Christ, to which all "vital" Christians belonged, as well as the succeeding ecumenical theology, which, although quite similar in its admission of an existing invisible "mystical body" of Christ, seeks a manifest unity in Christ.
*55:13-55:46*

So now that the Orthodox are involved and other mainline Protestants are involved, they're no longer satisfied with this church within and above and transcending.
*55:46-55:55*

They want to manifest unity.
*55:55-55:57*

They want to take this given unity, everybody acknowledges, like we're all one in Christ, right?
*55:57-56:02*

What does that mean?
*56:02-56:03*

Well, it's not manifest, but invisibly we're all one in Christ, right?
*56:03-56:07*

There's a new ecclesiology.
*56:07-56:08*

Okay, but that's nice, but that's not enough.
*56:09-56:10*

We need a manifest unity of Christ.
*56:11-56:13*

So on both counts, we have a new teaching, a teaching that is not the teaching of the Holy Fathers.
*56:13-56:21*

We don't believe and have never believed that it's possible to be united in Christ without a manifest unity like the evangelical experience, that you can have dogmatic differences.
*56:21-56:31*

You can have actually opposition in terms of dogma and doctrine.
*56:32-56:35*

You can have, in other words, falsehood.
*56:35-56:38*

You can have chaos in terms of the revelation, who Christ is, what the Church is, what it means to be in Christ.
*56:38-56:43*

All those things can be wildly opposed, or not expressing the same belief, and yet you can talk about the same experience, the same Christ, the same Church, because that's the revelation.
*56:43-56:57*

The revelation is a given.
*56:57-56:58*

So you can't have those differences and talk about the same experience.
*56:58-57:03*

Experience and theology are inseparable.
*57:03-57:05*

Life and faith are inseparable.
*57:06-57:08*

But here we have a division.
*57:08-57:10*

So neither that, nor the new version, which is we're going to manifest that unity which exists as if it's not already manifest.
*57:11-57:19*

I mean, it's a given, it's Christ, and it's manifest.
*57:20-57:24*

That's the incarnation.
*57:24-57:25*

So we're doubting the incarnation, essentially, right?
*57:26-57:28*

We're doubting that the incarnation continues.
*57:28-57:31*

We're doubting the words of the Lord that He will be with us always.
*57:32-57:34*

We're doubting that it's one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
*57:35-57:38*

We have to manifest that.
*57:38-57:39*

It doesn't exist right now.
*57:39-57:40*

We're going to make it real.
*57:40-57:41*

We're going to manifest it.
*57:41-57:42*

Okay.
*57:42-57:42*

So that's going on.
*57:42-57:44*

And unfortunately, it's unmistakable that this encyclical is in sync with that whole mentality that already existed.
*57:44-57:56*

The 1920 encyclical has wrongly been hailed as a prophetic and groundbreaking event, which not only ushered in the Orthodox into the ecumenical movement, but largely was responsible for the movement itself.
*57:59-58:13*

That is not correct.
*58:13-58:14*

That is a wishful thinking on the part of Orthodox ecumenists.
*58:15-58:18*

Rather, the encyclical appears to be a reaction and a departure.
*58:19-58:22*

It's a reaction to political and world events and a departure from hitherto cautious approach based on the experience of the Orthodox and churches, ancient cannons.
*58:23-58:32*

You got to remember this is World War I right on the, right on the heels of World War I, which was very traumatic for all of Europe, you know, probably the worst, obviously the worst to that point in terms of death and destruction.
*58:32-58:44*

All the rest.
*58:44-58:44*

So people are looking, and this is not an accident, right?
*58:45-58:49*

This is a part of the whole 20th century.
*58:49-58:51*

The country continued the same kind of thing.
*58:51-58:54*

We have massive wars, massive fear, massive destruction, and then people run to do away with whatever is dividing them, regardless of truth or dogma.
*58:54-59:03*

And that's, I don't think, an accident by any means.
*59:04-59:07*

And so you have a departure, but it was more than just a departure.
*59:08-59:15*

It represented a remarkable change of mind.
*59:16-59:18*

I'm quoting now, uh, people in the ecumenical movement at the time.
*59:18-59:23*

With the encyclical, the Patriarchate did not simply change its stance vis-a-vis the heterodox confessions.
*59:23-59:29*

Of course, it's not that simple.
*59:30-59:31*

It changed its understanding of the Orthodox Church itself.
*59:32-59:34*

This is the major difference, apart, uh, in the Ecumenical Patriarchate in the 1920s is you have a different perception of the church itself and it can't be otherwise.
*59:34-59:43*

Right?
*59:44-59:45*

These things go together.
*59:45-59:46*

Your understanding of the church is going to, of course, affect and guide your understanding of those outside the church among the heterodox.
*59:47-59:53*

If you change your vision of the heterodox, you're going to end up changing your vision of the church in the sense of ecclesial, in terms of the church and what it is, right?
*59:54-01:00:04*

We're going to change that.
*01:00:04-01:00:05*

It's going to be inevitable.
*01:00:05-01:00:06*

It's the same thing we're going to face going forward in terms of the religions of the world.
*01:00:07-01:00:10*

people are going to say, once upon a time people said, you know, the religions are inspired by demons.
*01:00:10-01:00:16*

It says in the Psalms, and clearly they're not revelations of God.
*01:00:17-01:00:22*

Well, now there is perennialism and other isms of our day, clearly posit that the religions are expressions and revelations in the providence of God for the salvation of mankind.
*01:00:22-01:00:31*

So if you accept that, of course you change who Christ is.
*01:00:32-01:00:37*

You're understanding of who Christ is going to change.
*01:00:37-01:00:39*

And that's exactly where we're headed, right?
*01:00:39-01:00:41*

We're going to have people coming to saying, not deny Christ, but accept the religions as salvific.
*01:00:41-01:00:47*

And that will be a denial of Christ indirectly.
*01:00:47-01:00:50*

And it's not really much different than what they had going on in the 1920s on the ecclesial level.
*01:00:51-01:00:56*

Now it's going to jump eventually to the person of Christ himself with regard to the various religions of the world.
*01:00:57-01:01:04*

So if you're interested in this topic, the history, it's a small book.
*01:01:04-01:01:07*

But it is of course much more there than I could present tonight.
*01:01:08-01:01:11*

You can pick it up.
*01:01:12-01:01:12*

Unfortunately, I don't think it's really available right now it's sold out.
*01:01:14-01:01:16*

You can find it in different places, maybe online, maybe Amazon has some old copies.
*01:01:16-01:01:20*

But it is actually available, just downloadable, just the text online if you go and just search the title, you'll find a PDF of it.
*01:01:20-01:01:28*

Won't have the pictures, won't have the introduction, things like that, but you can get the basic text.
*01:01:29-01:01:34*

Now, let's go quickly through a few things.
*01:01:34-01:01:37*

We want to run to the fathers and get to the patristic teaching here.
*01:01:37-01:01:40*

But just so you get a sense of things, right?
*01:01:41-01:01:43*

So hopefully this is not a very good image and I didn't have time to write it all up and present it.
*01:01:43-01:01:47*

But hopefully you can see, let me just go full screen on this so you can see what we're talking about historically.
*01:01:47-01:01:54*

So here on the left, you see the ecumenical tree, it says, and underneath it says Edinburgh 1910.
*01:01:54-01:02:00*

And out of Edinburgh, you have these different movements.
*01:02:00-01:02:02*

You have the missionary cooperation, International Missionary Council, meetings in Jerusalem, this is the far left, the line coming down the far left.
*01:02:02-01:02:12*

It continues on the box on the right, and then through Mandras, 1928, etc.
*01:02:12-01:02:16*

Okay, then you have the Faith and Order, Geneva, Lusanne, Edinburgh, etc., all the way to the founding of the World Council of Churches in 1948, the First Assembly.
*01:02:16-01:02:26*

That's a part of that, it becomes a part of that.
*01:02:27-01:02:29*

uh... the life and work the third one over from the left uh... begins after edinburgh that's another group of ecumenical scholars and churchman and that also leads eventually to the founding of the world council of churches these different movements are out of edinburgh eventually they unite thirty eight years later and they become the world council of churches uh... and uh... and then you know history continues with the second vatican council which is a the other major event in terms of propelling ecumenism on its way, in terms, you know, along these lines of this ecclesiology.
*01:02:29-01:03:07*

More refined at Vatican II, but not substantially different in terms of believing in a church that can be divided, a church that is partial, experience of Christ, which is partial, and all the rest.
*01:03:09-01:03:20*

Now, this little image here, hopefully, will help you also to frame the whole question of ecumenism, ecumenical movement.
*01:03:20-01:03:29*

You can see here that there's, in the far left, there's different things coming together to form the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910.
*01:03:29-01:03:37*

You have different movements, different student movements, etc.
*01:03:38-01:03:40*

And there you have the first big circle here, Edinburgh 1910, on the left.
*01:03:41-01:03:45*

And out of that there's three movements that we just said, right?
*01:03:45-01:03:49*

We have the International Missionary Council, we have the Faith and Order, we have Life and Work.
*01:03:49-01:03:52*

You see those three like rivers.
*01:03:52-01:03:53*

And eventually, 1948, two of them are united in 1948, eventually the Missionary Council becomes a part of the World Council of Churches in '61.
*01:03:54-01:04:04*

Now, you have two little things here that 1911 and 1920, the encyclical, which have the little pyramid with an eye, that is a symbol of the participation Ecumenical Patriarchate in the various movements of humanism in the early part of the century that are formative for the Ecumenical Patriarchate to be involved in humanism. But pretty much the dominating personalities and ideologies and all the rest comes from the Protestant world. The Orthodox are a minority and they have changed very little and it goes on and through well So at this point it was only 1998, but it continues on with various gatherings and all the rest.
*01:04:06-01:04:52*

So that'll give you hopefully a sense of ecumenical movement as a movement.
*01:04:52-01:04:56*

But we're interested in the dogma of ecumenism.
*01:04:56-01:04:59*

In other words, the question of the church.
*01:04:59-01:05:01*

Because this is a question of faith.
*01:05:01-01:05:03*

We don't confess, we don't say we acknowledge the church.
*01:05:03-01:05:07*

From the fourth century on, I mean in terms of a creed, from the fourth century on we We always believe this, but we put down in the 381 in the Second Ecclesiastical Council, what do we confess?
*01:05:08-01:05:20*

I believe in one Holy Catholic and Epistle to the Church.
*01:05:21-01:05:25*

Just like we believe in the Father, believe in the Son, we believe in the Holy Spirit, we believe in the Church.
*01:05:25-01:05:31*

Why is it that?
*01:05:31-01:05:31*

Is it a fourth person of the Trinity?
*01:05:32-01:05:34*

No, it's the incarnate Logos, the body of Christ.
*01:05:34-01:05:38*

It is the God-man.
*01:05:39-01:05:41*

And so it is a divine human organism.
*01:05:41-01:05:44*

It is the unity of man and God.
*01:05:44-01:05:46*

It's where salvation is worked out.
*01:05:46-01:05:48*

It is a, uh, you know, the famous saying of St.
*01:05:49-01:05:54*

Cyprian, which many people have stumbled over and misunderstood, uh, that outside the church, there is no salvation.
*01:05:54-01:06:00*

As Father George Florovsky famously said, it's, uh, it's simply saying the obvious, and that is that the church is salvation, because the church is Christ.
*01:06:00-01:06:11*

And we believe in the church, right?
*01:06:11-01:06:14*

So this is hugely important for us to understand here, and why we want to understand ecumenism and the ecumenical movement, because we want to understand this, what the boundaries are in terms of the faith and not to fall outside that.
*01:06:14-01:06:29*

We want to stay on the narrow path of salvation.
*01:06:29-01:06:31*

We don't want to be confused and drawn away into a new and innovative idea, like they said they were very happy about.
*01:06:32-01:06:39*

A new and innovative idea about the church and how it works and unity and all this.
*01:06:39-01:06:42*

We're not interested in that. We're Orthodox. We want to stay faithful to what's been revealed by Jesus Christ, the Apostles, and the church has confessed for 2,000 years.
*01:06:43-01:06:50*

So it's extremely important now, let's enter into the question of the church, the dogma of the church, and what it means to be a member of the church.
*01:06:51-01:07:02*

Now, we'll begin just a few words from Father Michael Pomazansky, who was a famous teacher of dogmatic theology at Holy Trinity Seminary, and an emigre from Russia, that great tradition of learned men at the turn of the century became. Now he just says something fairly obvious but important for us to understand in the 1950s and 60s when he's writing. He says look this is this embrace and running toward dialogue actually is not justified. We can talk about that we've talked about it in the past very important to understand the The proper understanding of Christian conversion and unity is not to engage in dialogue which is not in the sense of seeking answers from Christ, but in the sense of we're going to search together and we're going to find the truth as if it's not been revealed.
*01:07:02-01:08:02*

So that's the kind of dialogue that's going on in the 20th century.
*01:08:02-01:08:05*

They clearly state that in all the various dialogues, that we accept that we as Orthodox, you as whatever, papal Protestants, have to come to the table and both of us have to accept and change and embrace.
*01:08:06-01:08:21*

So that's a given in humanism.
*01:08:22-01:08:24*

That kind of dialogue is not justified, because the things that are being put on the table are not for negotiation.
*01:08:25-01:08:34*

It's not possible for us to dialogue about that.
*01:08:34-01:08:38*

We simply preach Christ, crucify, present Him, and it is between the person, the people, and the leaders, and Christ Himself to accept the Gospel and embrace Christ.
*01:08:38-01:08:50*

That's not up for debate or negotiation on our part.
*01:08:50-01:08:54*

That's our duty as Orthodox Christians to simply preach and teach and present the faith.
*01:08:54-01:08:58*

So unfortunately, the ecumenical movement is not occupied with the question of unity of faith, as we saw.
*01:08:59-01:09:08*

It's mainly about mission.
*01:09:08-01:09:11*

We have a unity already.
*01:09:11-01:09:13*

Let's figure out how we can do mission together.
*01:09:13-01:09:14*

But with the aim of participating in the proposed plan for an epical, a very massive reconstruction of human society, that's what's going on in the 20th century, globalization and all of the other, that's now you can, now you're wearing it up in transhumanism.
*01:09:15-01:09:31*

All of that, it's a process of the 20th century of, of, of re imagining, refashioning, re, uh, reworking the old order and bringing the new order.
*01:09:31-01:09:43*

Right.
*01:09:43-01:09:43*

Uh, that's what he saw very early on and is talking about here, but this is what it's all about.
*01:09:44-01:09:49*

Now, nonetheless, he says sooner or later, the question of the foundation scope of Christian faith in this attempt that union will have to arise. In other words, we will have to come to terms with the fact that our participation is impinging upon and undermining the question of Christian faith and has to be addressed. It is our obligation to show why this movement cannot be justified. In other words, we have to come and spend time. This is very important. Orthodox have to give a witness to the nature of the problem here because clearly They did not understand it among themselves, the Protestants and the others, and teach through example and word why this dialogue is unjustified.
*01:09:51-01:10:30*

We ourselves will not be completely justified if we descend from the breadth of the Orthodox worldview with all its fullness to a narrow platform of conceptions and most importantly to Western conceptions of the Church.
*01:10:31-01:10:44*

Exactly what has happened among those who are involved in the exceptions and thank God there are people who are still at least theoretically hanging on to Orthodox Confession of Faith, not as many as there used to be.
*01:10:44-01:10:57*

Florovsky was a great example, someone who was engaged but never totally, he had some errors, but never totally compromised obviously the Orthodox Faith in terms of our Confession of Faith, although he was quite wrong in his limits of the church article because he embraced Augustinian ideas which had never been at the heart of the Orthodox ecclesiology.
*01:10:57-01:11:20*

So in any case, he's saying, look, if you go there and you adopt those, well, there's not gonna be anything positive coming out of it.
*01:11:22-01:11:30*

And that's largely what has happened, especially after Vatican II.
*01:11:30-01:11:33*

Now, a word about this aspect of things, and it's been, as you saw, and it's been much more the case since the '60s, '70s, '80s, ecumenism's always been about sociological horizontal plane.
*01:11:34-01:11:48*

This earth, this life, and are working together to make it a better place, to make it a unified place, to bring the gospel, the English, you know, the early missionaries were doing, bring English to the natives.
*01:11:49-01:12:01*

We've got to teach them English.
*01:12:01-01:12:02*

We got to teach them culture and, you know, English and American culture.
*01:12:02-01:12:05*

And then we've got to make them Christians.
*01:12:05-01:12:07*

It was this, this multifaceted kind of inculturalization of Western society into the world.
*01:12:07-01:12:12*

That's from the very beginning been the tone set by missionaries.
*01:12:13-01:12:16*

There was no, nobody said, well, wait a minute, that's not really right.
*01:12:16-01:12:19*

Is it?
*01:12:19-01:12:20*

But no, no, that's fine.
*01:12:20-01:12:21*

That's who we are.
*01:12:21-01:12:22*

We're going to bring that.
*01:12:22-01:12:23*

It's a, it's again, a big part of why we have globalization today.
*01:12:23-01:12:26*

And it's reaching such, uh, such degrees today with, with, uh, talk of one world government or world, uh, new order and all the rest.
*01:12:27-01:12:36*

It's based on that massive missionary drive in the 19th century.
*01:12:36-01:12:43*

So this is what's going on in Cubanism throughout the 20th century and today.
*01:12:44-01:12:48*

It distorts the Church, turns her earthward to the sociological plane.
*01:12:48-01:12:54*

It brings it from the spiritual and the dogmatic plane and makes the Church something that's serving man in this life, right?
*01:12:54-01:13:04*

And we hear that all the time.
*01:13:05-01:13:06*

The church should be about helping people.
*01:13:06-01:13:08*

The church should be about, you know, the philanthropic work, of course, as a fruit of our life in Christ, not as an aim and as an end of our life in Christ.
*01:13:08-01:13:20*

And then that's the great distortion.
*01:13:20-01:13:21*

And it will, it is playing and bringing about the ascent and the rise of the spirit of Antichrist.
*01:13:22-01:13:29*

Because he will direct all the attention to this world and saving people from the troubles and the sicknesses and the wars of this world without any talk about eternal life as the aim of the life of the Church.
*01:13:29-01:13:44*

It would be a total distortion of the Church to make it earthbound and earthward.
*01:13:44-01:13:48*

So this is what's happening largely in the Ecumenical Movement.
*01:13:49-01:13:52*

This saintly bishop who is reposed now, Metropolitan Pavlos, Paul from Athens, he says, I'm just going to read the second part.
*01:13:52-01:14:01*

in orthodox theology we do not have a community of churches as they were talking about making the community of churches uh...
*01:14:03-01:14:10*

let's see this contextual theology was the conversion of missions into a community of churches admission cases we don't have that we have one holy catholic upstart church the appearance of christian missions emerging from a quote community of churches degrades the one church to a group of denominations that does not reveal the only truth and further degrades missionary work to what, to a sociological instead of a soteriological perspective.
*01:14:10-01:14:38*

That's the first casualty, and of course that's why it is so dangerous, and it is a part and parcel of the descent of Antichrist, because the first victim is salvation, in and in Christ and for Christ, in the body of Christ.
*01:14:39-01:14:54*

And that's the proof that this is satanic and demonic, ultimately, because it takes people not into the body of Christ and initiation, which has to be the end of everything we do.
*01:14:56-01:15:06*

If our preaching at the end keeps people in delusion outside the body of Christ, it doesn't bring an end to heresy.
*01:15:06-01:15:12*

It doesn't bring an end to delusion and schism.
*01:15:12-01:15:16*

If our preaching and teaching is ineffective to bring people to repentance, In other words, we're distorting it and therefore becomes of this world.
*01:15:17-01:15:26*

Well, that of course is a proof and a confirmation that we've departed from the church and the Holy father.
*01:15:27-01:15:35*

And this is what ecumenism does.
*01:15:35-01:15:37*

It deadens and it actually blocks the return and it totally, in many ways, blurs the boundaries and therefore those who are outside of the boundaries of the church, they no longer see and understand their distance.
*01:15:37-01:15:53*

But they have this idea that they're already in.
*01:15:54-01:15:56*

And that's being done by Orthodox Christians many times.
*01:15:57-01:16:00*

They're blurring the boundaries.
*01:16:00-01:16:01*

They're intentionally saying salvation, participation is possible outside of the Orthodox faith, outside of the Orthodox Church, outside of the given and the revelation of Jesus Christ, among the various earth-made denominations.
*01:16:01-01:16:17*

And that is just not just an error, it's an anti-gospel.
*01:16:17-01:16:22*

It's an anti-gospel at the end of the day.
*01:16:24-01:16:25*

So very, very instructive.
*01:16:26-01:16:29*

We could go on, we could have a whole evening, we probably should at one point have an evening about the social gospel and the distortion of the gospel and the earthbound, earthward turn of many Christians, which is a preparation for antichrist eventually.
*01:16:29-01:16:43*

Now let's turn our attention to what's become the most important uh...
*01:16:45-01:16:50*

way in which humanism talks about our unity and that is a common baptism.
*01:16:50-01:16:54*

It's hugely important in the ecumenical movement, it's hugely important as a bridge. If we can all say that we're baptized, and that's what Vatican II does, it accepts the baptism of all Christians as somehow initiating, partially so, those people who've been baptized. Of course, baptism here doesn't mean immersion, which is what it does mean in Greek, it means immersion in the water, it doesn't mean that here, it means simply using water, and you can see here in the pictures, the Pope in both cases in Sistine Chapel, he's giving us an example of what it means to baptize for the the Pope and the Vatican, and of course it means a little bit of water on the forehead of the child, and now that's not baptism actually, and you might say, well don't don't be such a stickler, well So, what if we were to say to you, "You don't need to use bread and wine, it's not important, don't be a stickler, use crackers and grape juice or whatever it is, it actually doesn't really matter what you do." It more or less symbolizes what the look...
*01:16:55-01:17:58*

Is that something that people would say, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter." Or would they say, "No, no, this is an abomination." And yet with this mystery, the distortion going back to Aquinas, justification for baptism basically a washing and not immersion, and therefore any old way, sprinkling, pouring, it doesn't matter, that's an Aquinan doctrine, never a patristic doctrine.
*01:17:58-01:18:21*

That has passed into so many Orthodox heads today, that we have relativized it and done away with the need to actually be immersed in the water, which is the expression of the theology of the church. Even Roman Catholic scholars say as much, that that's the proper way to express the mystery, And yet it doesn't matter.
*01:18:21-01:18:40*

It doesn't matter if you do that.
*01:18:42-01:18:43*

Well, it does matter for the Orthodox.
*01:18:43-01:18:44*

It's integral to the mystery.
*01:18:44-01:18:46*

It's extremely important.
*01:18:46-01:18:47*

And so you see right here that this is a manifest of the mentality.
*01:18:47-01:18:54*

In other words, the dumbing down, the minimization, the minimal requirement of being a Christian is just to have the words said and the water sprinkled by somebody, somewhere.
*01:18:54-01:19:05*

This is taught, not in Vatican II, but probably going back to Trent.
*01:19:05-01:19:09*

that a atheist, a non-believer, a Jew, anyone can do this as long as you're doing it as the church intends and they're using the water and they're saying the words. That's the legalistic delusional teaching that's present for hundreds of years among the papal Protestants and the followers of the Pope. Never a part of the Orthodox Church's understanding of things. It's actually, I would say, a mockery of the mystery to talk about in such a way as if anyone can initiate into Christ who's not themselves initiated into Christ.
*01:19:09-01:19:43*

This is the epitome of a legalization, which basically does away with the mystery.
*01:19:43-01:19:47*

So this is the reality.
*01:19:48-01:19:49*

Not only physically, manifestly have they abandoned the meaning of baptism, but that's an expression rather of their theological and spiritual understanding of the mystery as well, in many ways.
*01:19:50-01:20:01*

They've dissolved the fullness and the glory of the mystery coming down from our Lord and the Holy Fathers.
*01:20:05-01:20:11*

And so this "baptism," which is whatever each denomination wants to be.
*01:20:11-01:20:17*

One time in the water, the Baptists, three sprinkling over the head, the Anglicans and the Roman Catholics, whatever, it doesn't matter.
*01:20:17-01:20:24*

It's a variety, it's just water.
*01:20:24-01:20:26*

So we are disciples of Aquinas if we follow this, and not disciples of the Holy Fathers.
*01:20:26-01:20:31*

This teaching, that there is a "common baptism" among all Christians, and that therefore, if the Orthodox are being pressured to accept the idea, that therefore, outside of the one mystery of the Church, the mysteries, the sacraments exist, so then we have to embrace the idea that Christ is given and giving himself in these "baptisms" to initiate these souls into what?
*01:20:32-01:21:01*

To the Church.
*01:21:02-01:21:03*

Oh, therefore we have a new understanding of the Church.
*01:21:03-01:21:05*

We have a Church that is divided, a Church that has heresy, a Church that has a totally different understanding of the Eucharist, of all these things.
*01:21:06-01:21:14*

We have now initiation into something that essentially is an invisible Church.
*01:21:15-01:21:19*

It ends up being an invisible church, because it's no longer united to the faith, it's no longer the all three together, way, truth, and life, but now we have a legalistic minimalization of the very meaning of these mysteries and of life in Christ.
*01:21:20-01:21:39*

How is one who is in a Protestant evangelical, newly created denomination, 50 years ago, 20 years ago, and doesn't believe in the Eucharist, doesn't confess the Orthodox faith, doesn't have a priesthood.
*01:21:39-01:21:53*

How is that person, Vatican II teaches this and some Orthodox ecumenist teaches, how is that person initiated into the life of Christ?
*01:21:53-01:22:00*

How is he initiated into the Orthodox faith?
*01:22:01-01:22:03*

When did he have the exorcism read over him?
*01:22:03-01:22:07*

When did he go through the process of purification to accept the faith?
*01:22:07-01:22:10*

When did any of that happen?
*01:22:10-01:22:11*

And yet that's the idea that's predominant in the ecumenical movement And with some hierarchs, prominent hierarchs, patriarchs, saying the following, "We exhort our faithful, Catholic and Orthodox," this is a common declaration, "to strengthen the spirit of brotherhood which derives from a single baptism and participation in the sacrament of life." So here is a confession among prominent Orthodox leaders that the Roman Catholic Pope, the Papal Protestants, what we call here the Papal Protestants, because the Pope was the first Protestant, he walked away from the Church and protested and of the church that walked away on his own.
*01:22:11-01:22:49*

He became the prototype for all the, all the reformed Protestants.
*01:22:51-01:22:54*

He and the Orthodox share and give and impart the one baptism and sacramental life, which means of course the Eucharist.
*01:22:55-01:23:03*

So you have an Orthodox who now have a totally new vision of the church.
*01:23:04-01:23:07*

And of course it's a heretical vision and it is an abomination and nothing to do with the church's teaching for 2000 years.
*01:23:08-01:23:15*

as you will see in a moment when we present the patristic teaching.
*01:23:16-01:23:20*

We have another patriarch who said, "We are all orthodox and heterodox members of Christ, a single unique body, a single unique new creation, since our common baptism has freed us from death." Now these men who teach this have fallen away from Christ and from the Church.
*01:23:20-01:23:38*

They've never been condemned, unfortunately.
*01:23:38-01:23:40*

In other words, they've never been called the repentance, is what I mean to say.
*01:23:40-01:23:43*

teaching has not been condemned, and they have not been called to repentance by the holy synods of their churches, and therefore we have a major problem.
*01:23:43-01:23:51*

But it is where we are headed, because there's not the checks and balances that need to go on.
*01:23:51-01:23:58*

And so we are moving quickly toward a distortion being now manifest perhaps in a false union and all the rest.
*01:23:58-01:24:07*

We'll see what God allows and how much repentance we all have for this state of things.
*01:24:07-01:24:13*

But let's look now at the Orthodox understanding of the mystery of baptism.
*01:24:13-01:24:18*

It's one Lord, of course, one faith, one baptism.
*01:24:18-01:24:21*

The Church's understanding of heterodox baptism flows from and is determined by its self-understanding of being the one Holy Catholic, Episodic Church, which alone performs the one baptism, unto the death, and the resurrection of Christ.
*01:24:21-01:24:33*

In other words, we're saying the obvious.
*01:24:33-01:24:34*

There's one Church, and the mysteries are in that one body, and they're performed and given, and He Himself, Christ, gives.
*01:24:35-01:24:42*

And it's just obvious.
*01:24:43-01:24:45*

The minute we move away from that, we have a new idea of what the church is.
*01:24:45-01:24:49*

We move away from the revelation that God has given us as to what His body is.
*01:24:49-01:24:55*

And it's this church which reforms the one baptism, of course, initiates into the death and resurrection of Christ.
*01:24:56-01:25:01*

So this is so, for the church is known in her mysteries, as we said, right?
*01:25:02-01:25:06*

The church is manifested in her mysteries.
*01:25:06-01:25:08*

Many who say the mysteries are there among the non-Orthodox, the Church is there.
*01:25:08-01:25:13*

The Church is there.
*01:25:15-01:25:16*

Because that's how you know the Church is somewhere.
*01:25:17-01:25:20*

Because the mysteries, they are the boundaries.
*01:25:20-01:25:21*

They are the boundaries, and they manifest the boundaries of the Church.
*01:25:22-01:25:26*

In and through the mysteries of the Church, the Church exists and is continually formed.
*01:25:26-01:25:30*

Her borders are set.
*01:25:30-01:25:31*

Her members identified.
*01:25:32-01:25:33*

Those who live their lives outside the mysterious life are outside the body of Christ.
*01:25:34-01:25:40*

It's that simple.
*01:25:41-01:25:42*

Does it mean that they can't follow Christ and try to love Christ?
*01:25:43-01:25:46*

Of course not.
*01:25:46-01:25:47*

You can try to be a Christian and struggle to be with him, but the scandal of particular, that Christ is here and not there, must be dealt with and embraced.
*01:25:47-01:25:59*

You have to embrace that with trust, just like Peter, and not rationally try to explain it away, which is what's going on in the ecumenical movement, unfortunately.
*01:26:00-01:26:08*

So I just to say here, we on the picture, the pictures here on the left are very interesting.
*01:26:10-01:26:14*

Of course, we have a baptism going on, full immersion, which unfortunately sometimes doesn't happen among Orthodox priests, which is a tragedy.
*01:26:14-01:26:21*

I hope that all Orthodox priests will do what is called for given to us by our Lord.
*01:26:22-01:26:31*

And then you have a very, very interesting, this picture here of post-baptismal during the Chrismation after a baptism.
*01:26:31-01:26:39*

And you have the light, the uncreated light of God that's shining forth and been recorded here in a mysterious and unfathomable way in this picture, as is also in this picture, same event.
*01:26:40-01:26:52*

And this is happened in a church in New Mexico.
*01:26:52-01:26:56*

Father John Bethencourt of Holy Trinity Antiochian Orthodox Church in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and he stated about this event, this picture, these pictures of this newly illumined, baptized Orthodox Christian. He said, "The pictures were taken a number of years ago at Holy Trinity Antiochian Orthodox Church in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I'm the priest in the center of the picture, right there with the cross." He's actually retired now. "And I had just completed three baptisms and was finishing the Charismation.
*01:26:57-01:27:26*

So that is a contemporary picture from the sacrament of baptism.
*01:27:28-01:27:32*

And here you have a manifestation of the spiritual reality of the mystery of baptism in the Orthodox Church.
*01:27:33-01:27:39*

The uncreated light taken from different angles and confessed.
*01:27:39-01:27:44*

Here, this is another angle, same person, confessed by the priest himself, who was present, and the pictures were taken by the father of one of the people who were baptized.
*01:27:44-01:27:56*

And he says this is a miracle, and it's manifest.
*01:27:57-01:28:01*

So I would put this here to drive home what the reality of baptism is.
*01:28:02-01:28:06*

It's not just some kind of external ritual.
*01:28:06-01:28:10*

This is a recreation, a death and resurrection, a new life.
*01:28:10-01:28:14*

It's Pentecost for each and every one of us, and why it's so, so important Orthodox Church not move away from its teachings on the boundaries and on the nature of initiation into the Body of Christ.
*01:28:14-01:28:28*

Holy Baptism is the portal of entry into the Body of Christ, and thus the foundation and presupposition of all subsequent mysteries.
*01:28:30-01:28:39*

The Lord Himself has solemnly declared, "Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." understanding of the Church is expressed preeminently in the symbol of faith, but also in the eternal words of the Apostle Paul, "One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one body, one spirit, one God and Father of us all." To this unbroken unity belongs the Christian baptism.
*01:28:41-01:29:05*

Upon this unity rests the unity of the Church.
*01:29:05-01:29:08*

The Lord, the One Lord, the One Faith, the One Baptism, these three integrate in the meaning of the one church and ensure her unbroken unity.
*01:29:09-01:29:18*

It's really quite straightforward.
*01:29:19-01:29:20*

We make a mess of it because we have another agenda, right?
*01:29:21-01:29:25*

I mean, we meaning people today are in our day and age.
*01:29:25-01:29:28*

Saint Cyril of Jerusalem says, said famously about the one baptism and the baptism of heretics in his days, fourth century, on the right here, you see a baptism that happened in Africa by a higher monk, the monastery of Gregoriu, on the right is the Bishop of Kolezi, Meletios, the successor to the great missionary in Congo, Father Cosmas, and I think it's Prodromos, I think is the higher monk here, who's baptizing there in Africa.
*01:29:30-01:29:58*

And they baptize everyone, and have from the beginning of the mission there, they baptize every single convert, whether they come from Protestantism or foreign Protestantism or papal Protestantism, or wherever they might be coming from, they are baptized and immersed.
*01:29:58-01:30:15*

Now, St.
*01:30:16-01:30:16*

Cyril of Jerusalem says, "The bath of baptism we may not receive twice or thrice, for there is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.
*01:30:16-01:30:27*

None but the heretics are rebaptized, since their former baptism was not baptism." And this is the patristic teaching of the great catechist of Jerusalem.
*01:30:28-01:30:38*

To this day, we celebrate His Catechism, and we pass it on and use it to teach and initiate people into the Church.
*01:30:39-01:30:46*

That's the ecrivia of the Church.
*01:30:46-01:30:48*

That's the norm.
*01:30:48-01:30:49*

That's what we all seek.
*01:30:49-01:30:50*

There's only exceptions to that under extreme and extraordinary circumstances that are called for, because, just like the thief on the cross, we have circumstances where our Lord Himself, through His own economy, departs temporarily from the economy that he has revealed, the "ekrivieh" the exactitude of the economy, baptism and faith, and returns quickly to that same divine economy.
*01:30:50-01:31:20*

It's the Lord Himself, He is not under His commands, He is over it, He is above it.
*01:31:20-01:31:25*

He can do what He likes.
*01:31:25-01:31:26*

And it's when He intercedes and guides His body to divert from, in a temporary and extraordinary way, the norm, then we can talk about the economy.
*01:31:26-01:31:36*

But this is the norm, the Ecrivia, what you just heard from St. Cyril, and what we're presenting here, this is the norm, this is what should be happening in 99% of the cases throughout the Church today.
*01:31:37-01:31:48*

Unfortunately, that's not the case, but we pray that it will quickly return to Ecrivia, as Metropolitan Herodotus Vakos and many others have said need to happen.
*01:31:48-01:31:58*

Now, I want to talk a little bit about this question of Ecrivia and Economia.
*01:31:58-01:32:04*

very quickly. We're already an hour and 37 minutes into this podcast, so we don't have much room for going into tangents anymore, but we'll quickly go through this. Pay attention, because here I think is a very good explanation of the "Ecrivia Economia" teaching by then I think was Proto-Presbyterian, later became Bishop George Grab, Reference Lecturer at Church of Srebrenica in New York.
*01:32:04-01:32:34*

And he I think does a good job of presenting the teaching here because it's under attack and doubted by those who would like us to tweak Our practices to make things a bit different but easier for converts and we've done a lot of economy which I Think is not really economy at all. It's part of me. Yeah, it's not a corner Mia It's "paranomia," which basically translates as a violation of the law, not a management of the household, but a violation.
*01:32:34-01:33:10*

But in any case, that's my particular understanding, and I submit it to the Church and to you all.
*01:33:10-01:33:17*

Now listen to what the Lord and President of Georgia has to say.
*01:33:18-01:33:21*

"From the most ancient times, beginning with the words of the apostle, 'One Lord, one faith, one baptism,' Orthodox Christians have confessed that There is only one true Church, to which the promise has been given that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
*01:33:21-01:33:35*

And we also think that no matter how hard one tries, he will not find this notion contradicted either in the works of the Holy Fathers or in the Holy Canons, properly understood within the "economia eclivia d'economia" that should be given.
*01:33:37-01:33:52*

In prescribing for various situations, three modes of being joined to the Church, there are different "economias" that have been enacted through Church history, sometimes through baptism, sometimes through renunciation of heresy and prismation, and other times simply through repentance.
*01:33:53-01:34:07*

Fairly rare, but it did happen.
*01:34:08-01:34:10*

And there's actually a lot of work being done.
*01:34:11-01:34:13*

Just a new book came out in Greek by a scholar talking about, for instance, the Seventh Ecumenical Council and the reception, and what that means and what's properly understood, because there's a lot of confusion today about the "economia" and why it's used, and on what basis.
*01:34:13-01:34:29*

But he says, these very situations, these needs that the Church faces, "the holy canons and all the holy fathers consistently support the conclusion that only the Orthodox Church unites with Christ and saves, whereas all other confessions are deprived of the grace-giving and saving mysteries." So even when we apply "economy," that basic dogma and confession of faith, because we believe in the Church is never doubted, never undermined by the Church Fathers.
*01:34:30-01:34:59*

Therefore, the canons call those who are united in the Orthodox Church, those of the number of the heretics who are saved, or being saved.
*01:35:00-01:35:07*

This is the canon 7.
*01:35:08-01:35:09*

That's how they refer to those who are coming to the Church from the heterodox.
*01:35:10-01:35:13*

Likewise, the differing practices employed in uniting the heretics of the Church do not in the least alter the eternal doctrine of the Orthodox Church, "She alone is true, saving, and the dove, and the unique mother of Christians.
*01:35:13-01:35:29*

And that is She in whom all the eternal and life-giving mysteries are received as salvation, and who subjects those who are in heresy to great censure and punishment."
*01:35:30-01:35:39*

(Canon 68, Council of Carthage)
*01:35:39-01:35:41*

This doctrine is expressed with particular vigor in the 46th Canon of the Holy Apostles.
*01:35:42-01:35:47*

The order that a bishop or presbyter who has accepted the baptism or sacrifice of heretics to be cast out, to be cast out.
*01:35:48-01:35:54*

So if you accept it and you recognize it as a mystery, the canon is saying you need to be cast out, you need to be defrocked from the priesthood.
*01:35:55-01:36:03*

What concord has Christ with Belial, or what part has a believer with an unbeliever, unquote.
*01:36:03-01:36:08*

Now, the question is, did St.
*01:36:09-01:36:12*

Cyprian, because this is what he's responding to in this portion, He's saying, people are saying, well, St. Cyprian, he changed the doctrine of the church, he's an innovator, he's the one who famously said there is no salvation outside the church, and so Father George is responding to this idea, and in this context we're getting an explanation of "Economia Ecrivia." In the book of the Helmsman, quote unquote, "The Canonical Answers of St. Timothy Archbishop of Alexandria." Very interesting document.
*01:36:13-01:36:44*

He was at the Second Ecumenical Council, where the confession that we read every day, twice a day, three times a day, where we say we believe in the church, the Creed, the Nicene Creed, he was at that council.
*01:36:45-01:36:59*

So remember that.
*01:37:00-01:37:01*

What he says here is very important, a great witness to the doctrine of the church.
*01:37:01-01:37:06*

He says, "We find in this text by St. Timothy, Archbishop of Alexandria, An authoritative explanation that reception into communion without baptism is neither a contradiction of that doctrine, nor an admission by the Church of the grace of the baptism, consequently of other religious rites, of heretics, but only an exceptional order of uniting those people of the Church whom the prospect of repeating the baptismal rite
*01:37:07-01:37:33*

(we're talking about the external rite, the actual immersion)
*01:37:34-01:37:37*

That's why saints will go on later on and say that if that rite is not done in the orthodox manner, it's not an immersion, then this economy is not possible.
*01:37:38-01:37:48*

It's not permissible.
*01:37:48-01:37:49*

The presuppositions do not exist.
*01:37:49-01:37:50*

So again, he says here that this reception in the community without baptism does not, therefore, mean a recognition of the mysteries outside the church.
*01:37:51-01:38:05*

But only in exceptional order of uniting those people to the Church, whom the prospect of repeating the baptismal rite might alienate from orthodoxy.
*01:38:06-01:38:15*

There's a pastoral urgency, for whatever reason.
*01:38:16-01:38:18*

The Church, Christ, determines that, like the thief on the cross, this person can be received in such a way.
*01:38:19-01:38:24*

The rite being performed, the external part having been performed by the heretics, Therefore the Church gives what the Church of the Heretics cannot give, which is the grace of God.
*01:38:26-01:38:38*

And that's universally confessed in the time of St. Cyprian and all the rest, that this is the case.
*01:38:38-01:38:43*

Outside the mysteries and outside the body of Christ, the mysteriological grace of the mysteries are not present outside the Church, as we've said again and again here tonight.
*01:38:43-01:38:52*

So the baptismal rite is not repeated.
*01:38:55-01:38:58*

That does not mean the mysteries exist, obviously, outside the Church.
*01:38:58-01:39:01*

So the question is, why do we not baptize heretics in every case who turn to the Catholic Church?
*01:39:01-01:39:07*

St. Timothy answers, "If this were done, hardly any man would turn from heresy, since he would be embarrassed by the baptism.
*01:39:07-01:39:13*

However, the Holy Spirit can also come by the laying on of the priest's hand and by prayer, as the acts of the apostles bear witness." So this is a clear exception to the rule, not the rule.
*01:39:14-01:39:30*

And it is, has its presuppositions.
*01:39:30-01:39:33*

It's not something that anybody can just willy-nilly say, Oh, I think we'll baptize this time.
*01:39:33-01:39:38*

Oh, I think we'll chrismate this time.
*01:39:38-01:39:39*

There has to be an urgent pastoral need.
*01:39:39-01:39:42*

There has to be the right already performed among the heretics so that the baptism is not, uh, the right itself is not undermined.
*01:39:42-01:39:52*

That the externals have happened.
*01:39:52-01:39:55*

Now the spiritual life is imparted, and that happens only in the Body of Christ.
*01:39:55-01:40:01*

One must believe that Timothy of Alexandria, who is an active part of the Second Ecumenical Council, is fully authoritative in explaining a principle which lay at the foundation of the seven canons of that council.
*01:40:01-01:40:13*

So who are we going to go to to figure out what that canon was all about?
*01:40:15-01:40:17*

This is one person we're going to go to, and he gives us an explanation.
*01:40:17-01:40:20*

People don't like to do that because they don't like, I mean, today, And the ecumenists and others don't want to do that.
*01:40:22-01:40:26*

They don't want to go to Timothy.
*01:40:26-01:40:26*

Timothy doesn't give us a good explanation because we can't fit our new ecclesiology into, you know, he doesn't make it easy for us to make a new ecclesiology.
*01:40:26-01:40:34*

So we don't really pay attention to him.
*01:40:34-01:40:36*

But he was at the council, which the canon was, you know, or at least the canon, some say the canon was actually written afterwards.
*01:40:36-01:40:42*

But in any case, he was at the Second-Infant Council where the confession was made about believing in the one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.
*01:40:42-01:40:49*

It's a very authoritative voice.
*01:40:50-01:40:52*

It ought to be pointed out that even St. Cyprian, a defender of uncompromising procedure as regards to the uniting of heretics of the church, admitted the possibility from a dogmatic point of view, of there being a united church without re-baptism, and that's surprising to people, right?
*01:40:53-01:41:09*

He says it should not happen.
*01:41:09-01:41:11*

And in his day and age, he said, there should be no, that should not happen because it undermines the salvation of the heretics, as you'll see.
*01:41:12-01:41:20*

But he doesn't say it's impossible.
*01:41:20-01:41:21*

And let's hear what he has to say.
*01:41:22-01:41:23*

He says, "But some will say, 'What will happen to those who before this turned from heresy to the church, and were received in the church without baptism?'" Because there were such cases.
*01:41:24-01:41:33*

Somebody's asking St. Cyprian, "What about them?" You're saying everybody has to be baptized. There is no baptism in the church.
*01:41:34-01:41:38*

Yes, okay, fine. But what do we do in those cases?
*01:41:39-01:41:41*

And he says, "The Lord, in his mercy, is able to grant them forgiveness.
*01:41:42-01:41:46*

And those who have been received in the church and who fell asleep in the church, he does not deprive the gifts of his church." So you say, well, if you can't correct it, you can't, it's, you know, it's been done.
*01:41:47-01:41:59*

Well, we trust in the gods, providence and all the rest.
*01:42:00-01:42:03*

But if we, if it's in our hands to stop this practice, St.
*01:42:03-01:42:09*

Cyprian certainly was for a krivia and the reception by baptism.
*01:42:09-01:42:14*

So he's not supporting that, but he's also not going to the extreme of saying that the Lord can do nothing with that.
*01:42:14-01:42:20*

"The Lord, in His mercy, is able to grant them forgiveness," he says.
*01:42:20-01:42:24*

"Although St. Cyprian admitted that to introduce such leniency was dogmatically permissible, he thought nevertheless that in practice it should not be allowed as a norm, because on account of it, belief in the Church as the unique custodian of grace would be weakened.
*01:42:25-01:42:40*

Since there will be no reason for the heretics to turn to us, when, since they have supposedly baptism, they think they have all the rest.
*01:42:41-01:42:51*

You see?
*01:42:51-01:42:51*

So how much more when the precepts of visions don't exist and we continue on undermining the boundaries, undermining the need for the heretics to come back, undermining the meaning of baptism itself, we're doing great disservice, not only to the heterodox, who would be more, according to St. Cyprian, more readily to come to the church.
*01:42:52-01:43:16*

Contrary to what people say today, you know, today it's permissiveness is the norm.
*01:43:16-01:43:21*

There's no pedagogy like St. Cyprian's been doing forward.
*01:43:22-01:43:25*

That's the spirit of the age, right?
*01:43:25-01:43:28*

Whatever's easiest, weakest, you know, minimal, that's what we choose.
*01:43:30-01:43:35*

And that's not actually spiritually profitable, many times, and it undermines the boundaries of the Church.
*01:43:35-01:43:41*

So he says, if we give them the idea that they have baptism, they think they have all the rest.
*01:43:42-01:43:53*

On the contrary, when they learn that outside the Church there is no baptism, and that their remission of sins cannot be granted, which is what he believed which is the patristic stance, "they will the more eagerly and quickly come to us, and will humbly ask for the treasures and the gifts of the Church, knowing that they absolutely cannot attain the true promise of grace, divine grace, if they do not turn first to the true Church." So this is a bit hard for some who have not been immersed in these teachings, but hopefully you can go back, listen, read, and understand the great wisdom here.
*01:43:54-01:44:28*

They are, as always, as Altar's Fathers, they are walking the tightrope.
*01:44:28-01:44:33*

They are walking the royal path.
*01:44:33-01:44:35*

They are not coming to either extreme, but they're pointing to us the "Ecrivia Economia" dichotomy.
*01:44:36-01:44:42*

They're showing us how it works in practice.
*01:44:42-01:44:44*

They're showing us the order of things and the hierarchy of things and how the norm is Ecrivia, always 99% of the time, baptism, and the exception, when there's grounds and presuppositions for it, is the economy.
*01:44:44-01:44:58*

Now, when and how that's been done in Church history, of course, there's been abuse in Church history.
*01:45:01-01:45:07*

Of course, there's been times when there's been things that should not have happened.
*01:45:08-01:45:12*

That's not where we go to find out the mind of Christ.
*01:45:12-01:45:15*

Church history is filled with all kinds of errors.
*01:45:15-01:45:17*

Church history in itself is instructive, but not necessarily giving us always and everywhere examples to imitate.
*01:45:18-01:45:25*

If we want to begin to understand this question, the best way to do it is boundaries of the Church and the mysteries, we have to go to the Church Fathers, not to Church history per se.
*01:45:25-01:45:33*

Now, the unity of the Church, and he ends this, Father George, and we'll move on.
*01:45:35-01:45:39*

The unity of the Church is uniformly confessed by the Apostles, the Holy Councils, the Holy Fathers, both before and after St. Cyprian.
*01:45:39-01:45:46*

And to tell the truth, it is only through prejudice that one could say there is any sort of contradiction in this doctrine.
*01:45:47-01:45:53*

Or we could add that St. Cyprian is somehow not presenting the doctrine.
*01:45:53-01:45:58*

Today, you hear that, it's a tragedy to hear Orthodox priests teach this, which is clearly not the consensus of the Church Fathers.
*01:45:58-01:46:05*

And they go along with, they end up saying absurd ideas about the Church.
*01:46:06-01:46:11*

You know, they're kind of searching for the prejudictive doctrine, and it's right in front of them.
*01:46:12-01:46:17*

So just listen to the Church Fathers who've spoken on this.
*01:46:17-01:46:20*

St.
*01:46:21-01:46:21*

Cyprian is one of them, but St.
*01:46:21-01:46:23*

Nicodemus and St.
*01:46:23-01:46:24*

by J.S.B.
*01:46:24-01:46:25*

Barskowski and St. Hilarion Trotsky, St. Basil the Great, many, many have spoken to this question and given us the economia, the exactitude, and the economy, a dichotomy, which explains our practice and explains the patristic mind.
*01:46:25-01:46:41*

Now, another big part of this whole ecumenical movement and ecumenism is, of course, praying together with the heterodox.
*01:46:42-01:46:50*

Is that blessed?
*01:46:50-01:46:51*

We could talk for hours on that.
*01:46:51-01:46:53*

I'm just going to give you one example, one witness, which is often neglected, probably not very well known, and that is the great canonist Theodor Bausman, patriarch of Antioch in the 12th century.
*01:46:53-01:47:06*

He was asked, "Shall one perform priestly rites or pray together without danger with heretics, namely Jacobites and Nestorians?" Now we're talking about Eastern heretics who have been condemned because of their refused to accept the Orthodox faith in the fourth, fifth, sixth ecumenical councils, and actually seventh and eighth as well.
*01:47:07-01:47:28*

And these are the Nestorians who didn't accept the third ecumenical council and the Monophysites in Syria, the Jacobites, who did not accept the fourth ecumenical council.
*01:47:28-01:47:38*

And so this is a major problem to this day in the Middle East, praying together with various heretical groups.
*01:47:39-01:47:45*

And so the question is very relevant to our day and our church, the church today.
*01:47:46-01:47:52*

Listen to what he says.
*01:47:52-01:47:53*

What do we do?
*01:47:54-01:47:54*

Can we pray with them or not?
*01:47:55-01:47:56*

He says, if their churches are even our own, or might one share a common table with them, in other words, go eat with them.
*01:47:56-01:48:01*

Can we do that?
*01:48:01-01:48:02*

Perform sponsorship of Holy Baptism.
*01:48:02-01:48:04*

Can we be sponsored at Holy Baptism?
*01:48:04-01:48:06*

Perform memorial services for the departed or commune, even commune of the Holy communion with them.
*01:48:07-01:48:13*

So these are very relevant, because unfortunately this is going on today in the Middle East.
*01:48:15-01:48:18*

There are Orthodox who have succumbed to another, I hate to say it, but it's basically another gospel, another Christ, another church, another understanding of the church, that they don't understand that probably, they're not really thinking about it very deeply, but these are the implications that have grave implications to our ecclesiology.
*01:48:20-01:48:41*

"For the errors difficulties create many such things, and I seek what one must do." Okay, so the questioner is saying, "Please help me understand what are the boundaries with regard to these particular heretics condemned." Those groups, in other words, the forefathers of these groups, they were condemned at committal counsel, very serious, of course.
*01:48:42-01:49:03*

And so, the patriarch, the great canonist says, "Do not give the holy things to the dogs, our Lord and God has said, nor cast pearls before swine." Okay, now just so people don't misunderstand our Lord, He doesn't call human beings dogs and swine, but He's saying that those, that picture there, pearls before a pig, and holy things before dogs, is a way to say the holy things are not given to those who can't and don't understand them and don't honor them.
*01:49:03-01:49:36*

Okay, that's what the Lord is saying, not towing His creation, a swine and a dog.
*01:49:36-01:49:41*

But that they don't understand, they don't keep in great reverence, and they don't understand, they cannot participate properly in the context of the church.
*01:49:42-01:49:52*

So he says, that's how he begins, by the words of our Lord.
*01:49:53-01:49:56*

"Indeed," he says, "on this account, Canon 64 of the Holy Apostles, the heralds of God, also states, 'If any clergyman or layman might enter an assembly of the Jews or heretics to pray, let him be defrocked and excommunicated." So, absolutely cannot go to an assembly of heretics or Jews or whatever other religion, obviously.
*01:49:57-01:50:18*

If they had Hindus or Sindus or whatever it might be, the religion, obviously you would apply it to them as well.
*01:50:18-01:50:24*

But that's who is around the Christians at the time.
*01:50:25-01:50:27*

So that person, that clergyman or layman, who goes and prays in the temple of the heretic, he needs to be excommunicated.
*01:50:28-01:50:36*

In other words, he needs to repent, and for a time, not take Holy Communion.
*01:50:36-01:50:40*

If he doesn't repent, obviously he can't be admitted to Holy Communion.
*01:50:40-01:50:43*

Canon 33 of the Council on Laodicea, but indeed also 6 and 34, states the following, "Concerning not permitting heretics to enter the house of God while they remain in heresy, because one must not pray with a heretic or schismatic, A Christian must not abandon Christ's martyrs and depart for false martyrs.
*01:50:44-01:51:05*

People talk about martyrs outside the Church.
*01:51:05-01:51:08*

They're talking about false martyrs here.
*01:51:08-01:51:10*

I'm just telling you the canon.
*01:51:10-01:51:11*

Don't shoot the messenger.
*01:51:11-01:51:12*

This is what we have to deal with.
*01:51:13-01:51:14*

If you want to follow the Holy Fathers, come to terms with what they teach.
*01:51:14-01:51:18*

And this is certainly a part of the patristic heritage.
*01:51:18-01:51:21*

Namely, heretical ones are those that the aforementioned heretics produced, for these are estranged from God.
*01:51:22-01:51:28*

Therefore, let those departing to them be anathematized." You go over to them, you go and pray with them, you are anathematized.
*01:51:29-01:51:37*

You're outside the church.
*01:51:37-01:51:38*

That's what anathema, by the way, is not a curse upon other people.
*01:51:38-01:51:43*

This is a misunderstanding of anathema.
*01:51:43-01:51:45*

Anathema is a lifting up to God that you are no longer a part of the body.
*01:51:45-01:51:49*

And that God, it's essentially a prayer that God would bring you to your senses.
*01:51:50-01:51:55*

You know, we're talking about people who depart the church, right?
*01:51:56-01:51:58*

They anathematize those who refuse to listen to the Church.
*01:51:58-01:52:01*

That's the context of anathema.
*01:52:02-01:52:04*

So we can go on and talk about different understandings and confusion today about anathema, but that's not really the topic.
*01:52:05-01:52:11*

Indeed, on this account, we also decided that both clergy and lady are subject not only to communication and defrocking when they pray together in a Church of Orthodox or heretics, or whenever they pray together as clergy, or even share a meal together. Now this is a pretty serious thing here, that even to the point of sharing a meal in those places, this is hundreds of years after the Council. This is 12th century. Councils happened in the 5th century, 600 years, 600 more years later. They're still talking about the same way to deal with these various groups. In the ecumenical movement, we have a totally different vision. It's opposed to this. They don't believe any of this should be applied, and that we're all one in Christ and all the rest. So this is a total totally opposed to the vision of the patriarch here and the canons. "Or even share a meal together, but also shall be punished in a more severe way according to the provisions of the sighted divine canons." So he's saying it's even worse than this. Now listen to this last line. Very important, because there are gonna There will be people who say, "No, no, no, no.
*01:52:12-01:53:23*

Doesn't apply today.
*01:53:23-01:53:24*

Doesn't apply." Listen now.
*01:53:25-01:53:26*

It says, "For the difficulties of areas and the increase of heretics did not change the soundness of the Orthodox faith." So he's saying basically throughout this whole canon, it still applies.
*01:53:26-01:53:37*

The increase of the heretics doesn't change the given about needing to be faithful and to maintain the soundness of the Orthodox faith.
*01:53:40-01:53:49*

doesn't change the nature of the problem.
*01:53:49-01:53:51*

It doesn't change the need for therapy.
*01:53:52-01:53:54*

It doesn't change the boundaries of the church.
*01:53:54-01:53:56*

The fact that a thousand or two thousand years passed, it doesn't matter.
*01:53:57-01:54:02*

600 years it passed.
*01:54:03-01:54:04*

Now, 1500 years, 600 years have passed.
*01:54:04-01:54:07*

Okay.
*01:54:07-01:54:07*

But it's still the same problem.
*01:54:08-01:54:09*

Now they might not be obviously the same rights and same implications for the descendants of the heretics of those who are actually at the council.
*01:54:10-01:54:18*

We understand that.
*01:54:18-01:54:19*

And we're not sitting in judgment of them.
*01:54:20-01:54:22*

We're saying the same parameters, same problem exists, and it has to be dealt with in a similar way.
*01:54:22-01:54:27*

You can't just ignore the therapy.
*01:54:27-01:54:30*

This is therapy.
*01:54:30-01:54:31*

The church, everything the church does is therapy.
*01:54:31-01:54:33*

It's not punishment and condemnation.
*01:54:34-01:54:36*

I know the terms say punish here, but just like you spank your child in order to heal him, or you discipline him, you don't spank him, you still inflict some kind of pedagogical tool there to get correction.
*01:54:36-01:54:52*

That's still got to happen today.
*01:54:52-01:54:54*

You can't ignore it.
*01:54:54-01:54:55*

If you do, you're walking away from the faith.
*01:54:55-01:54:57*

Now, quickly, let's go through some contemporary saints about this topic.
*01:54:57-01:55:01*

I'm sorry we're going very late tonight.
*01:55:01-01:55:03*

I didn't expect it to go this late.
*01:55:03-01:55:04*

I'm frankly surprised that I had so much material able to present in such a short amount of time.
*01:55:05-01:55:10*

Now, Father George Coutu, one of the great contemporary confessors of the faith in Romania, in the prisons, in the atheist prisons, Here's what he has to say about ecumenism, and he has much more to say, I'm just giving you one little taste.
*01:55:10-01:55:21*

Now, we're talking about ecumenism as a dogmatic heresy, right?
*01:55:22-01:55:25*

The overturning of the boundaries, the overturning of the nature of the Church, the overturning of the need for repentance to come to the Church, all the rest that we've implied and presented up to this point.
*01:55:25-01:55:36*

"There is a spirit unveiling in Europe," he says, "in the world in general, a new-age kind of spirit that frequently changes its appearance and speech, striking the Christian world from all sides.
*01:55:37-01:55:48*

Its image is generally gentle, its discourse attractive, but its intent perfidious.
*01:55:48-01:55:55*

This spirit can speak in beautiful words about family, but its intent is to annihilate it.
*01:55:57-01:56:02*

It can speak on the church full of love for all religious syncretism, but its urge is primarily to dispel orthodoxy.
*01:56:04-01:56:11*

It can speak about nations and their homelands as something it tries to support, but its intent is to destroy both the Church and the nations.
*01:56:12-01:56:21*

This spirit is called ecumenism.
*01:56:21-01:56:24*

All right, so one definition from one contemporary confessor of the faith.
*01:56:24-01:56:27*

What is ecumenism?
*01:56:28-01:56:29*

Father Ciro from Rose, talking about what we need to do within the contemporary ecumenical world that we live in.
*01:56:29-01:56:35*

He says Orthodoxy has one thing to say to the ecumenical movement.
*01:56:36-01:56:40*

"Here is the truth.
*01:56:40-01:56:41*

Join yourself to it.
*01:56:42-01:56:44*

To remain to discuss "this truth" not merely weakens the Orthodox witness.
*01:56:45-01:56:50*

It destroys it." Very good and powerful and succinct words from Fr.
*01:56:51-01:56:55*

Zerubbabel.
*01:56:56-01:56:56*

He says the following to all of us to stay on guard, lest we be deceived.
*01:56:56-01:57:03*

He says, "Orthodox Christians, hold fast to the grace which you have.
*01:57:03-01:57:07*

Never let it become a matter of habit.
*01:57:07-01:57:09*

Never measure it by merely human standards as they did and do in the ecumenical movement, and expect it to be logical or comprehensible to those who understand nothing higher than what is human, who are thinking to obtain the grace of the Holy Spirit in some other way than that which the one Church of Christ has handed down to us.
*01:57:09-01:57:28*

True orthodoxy by its very nature must seem totally out of place in these demonic times.
*01:57:28-01:57:34*

That's the nature of the world we live in.
*01:57:35-01:57:38*

Father Saint Huston Popovich now, what is ecumenism?
*01:57:38-01:57:42*

What is it dogmatically?
*01:57:42-01:57:43*

What is it spiritually?
*01:57:43-01:57:44*

What is this monster of heresy which overturns the continuation of the Incarnation and our life in Christ?
*01:57:44-01:57:51*

He says, the great saint, "Like the holy apostles, the holy fathers and teachers of the Church, confess the unity and uniqueness of the Orthodox Church with the divine wisdom of the cherubim and zeal of the seraphim.
*01:57:51-01:58:03*

Understandable, therefore, is the fiery zeal which animated the holy fathers of the Church in all cases of division and falling away, and the stern attitude toward heresies and schisms." It's understandable.
*01:58:03-01:58:16*

If you understand, what's at stake?
*01:58:16-01:58:17*

"In that regard, the holy ecumenical and holy local councils are preeminently important, according to their spirit and attitude wise in those things pertaining to Christ.
*01:58:18-01:58:26*

The church is not only one, but also unique.
*01:58:26-01:58:29*

Just as the Lord Christ cannot have several bodies, so He cannot have several churches.
*01:58:31-01:58:37*

According to her theanthropic nature, the church is one and unique.
*01:58:38-01:58:42*

Just as Christ the God-man is one and unique.
*01:58:42-01:58:46*

And then he says the following, the famous words of this great saint and confessor of our day, Serbian theologian, Hieromonk, spiritual father.
*01:58:46-01:58:55*

He says, "Ecumenism is the common name for the pseudo-Christianities and the pseudo-churches of Western Europe.
*01:58:55-01:59:01*

Within it is the heart of all European humanisms, led by the papacy.
*01:59:02-01:59:11*

All these pseudo-Christianities, all these pseudo-churches are nothing more than one heresy next to the other.
*01:59:11-01:59:17*

Their common name is pan-heresy." I know for those who are not familiar with these bold words of the saint, this might seem really, I don't know, maybe you're the first time you're hearing this.
*01:59:18-01:59:28*

Maybe you're a Protestant or Roman Catholic.
*01:59:29-01:59:30*

Maybe you're new to the patristic mind.
*01:59:30-01:59:33*

It sounds harsh.
*01:59:33-01:59:34*

It sounds condominatory.
*01:59:35-01:59:36*

He's not actually condemning human beings per se, but teachings and stances and delusions precisely like a doctor wants to get rid of the various illnesses and diseases and viruses from the body in order to save it, that's the way you should understand these powerful words from these great contemporary saints.
*01:59:36-01:59:56*

Now, the great ascetic of Monathos, the great Saint Paisios, when he was writing to Patriarch Athenagoras, who wrote an open letter back in the 60s, when Patriarch Athenagoras was going over to the Pope and he was saying all kinds of unorthodox things about the Church, and he was embracing unrepentant Pope who wanted to essentially be recognized.
*01:59:56-02:00:20*

So he says about Patriarch Athenagoras that it appears he loved another modern woman, talking about spiritual fornication.
*02:00:22-02:00:34*

Okay.
*02:00:34-02:00:34*

Spiritual fornication means when you are not faithful to our Lord and the Church and the Mother, which is the Church, you're not faithful, you're not presenting faithfully the witness, you are falling into a kind of fornication, spiritual fornication.
*02:00:34-02:00:47*

That's what a lot of what ecumenism is doing.
*02:00:48-02:00:50*

It's bringing people into spiritual, uh, uncleanliness.
*02:00:51-02:00:55*

The great, one of the quotes I should have presented tonight, which I neglected, I'll tell you verbally from the great elder of Katounakia, Ephraim.
*02:00:56-02:01:04*

And he says regarding, he prayed, somebody asked him, what is ecumenism?
*02:01:05-02:01:09*

And he prayed and he says that humanism is filled with the demonic energy.
*02:01:09-02:01:14*

It's a filthy, demonic sickness.
*02:01:15-02:01:18*

Okay.
*02:01:18-02:01:19*

Because it's filled with half-truths and lies about the body of Christ.
*02:01:19-02:01:22*

And so he says here, the unfortunate Athenagoras who left his first love, and in the name of love, trampled upon the cross of Christ and the preaching of the crucified one.
*02:01:22-02:01:40*

It appears he loved another modern woman, he says, which is called the Papist Church, because our Orthodox mother has not made an impression on him at all, for she is so modest.
*02:01:41-02:01:50*

This love, which was heard from Constantinople, caused a sensational impression of sorts among many Orthodox, who nowadays live in an environment of such meaningless love in cities across the entire world.
*02:01:51-02:02:05*

In other words, he's saying we're getting infected by this fake, false, superficial, fleshly love, which is an enemy to truth, and therefore is not true love at all.
*02:02:05-02:02:16*

It's not sacrificial.
*02:02:16-02:02:17*

It's not crucified.
*02:02:17-02:02:17*

Right?
*02:02:18-02:02:18*

Moreover, this love is of the spirit of our age, this fake love.
*02:02:20-02:02:25*

The family will lose its divine meaning from just such kinds of love, which have as their aim the breakup, and not the union.
*02:02:26-02:02:35*

He also says, "What is ecumenism?
*02:02:37-02:02:43*

Well, it's one of the devil's tentacles.
*02:02:43-02:02:45*

The devil spread three tentacles to capture the world – the rich to catch them with masonry and secret societies, the poor with communism, and the religious with ecumenism." So he says it's one of the three main tentacles of the demons to catch man in falsehood and lies and direct him toward this life and this world, and not to heaven and not to the truth, way, and life of the gospel.
*02:02:47-02:03:17*

Now, another question that's going to be coming up and is addressed in ecumenism and is a major problem today.
*02:03:18-02:03:24*

There are increasingly Orthodox clergymen and theologians who are supposing that they can speak of apostolic succession existing among the heterodox and the Eucharist existing among the heterodox, which, as we've said before, is impossible because the Orthodox faith is presupposed, on the day of Pentecost, they were of one mind in one place.
*02:03:25-02:03:52*

They had the Orthodox faith and the Eucharistic assembly.
*02:03:52-02:03:54*

Those things are inseparable.
*02:03:54-02:03:55*

So no one can talk about the apostles, the Eucharist, the faith and the church, in other words, apostolic concession and Eucharist cannot be spoken of outside of the one faith.
*02:03:56-02:04:07*

So the question is, do papal Protestants and anti-Chalcedonians, the various descendants of those who rejected the Fourth Accounting Council, called for the longest time, monophysites, today they don't want that to be called that, which is, I guess, a good thing.
*02:04:08-02:04:22*

But that's what they were, those descendants of and adherence to the Oscuras and Severus and these various clerics who were defrocked and anathematized at the councils, the fourth ecumenical council, they historically always referred to as monophysites.
*02:04:22-02:04:42*

They have supposedly by these people claim apostolic succession and a valid Eucharist.
*02:04:42-02:04:49*

Because, as it's supposed, they have maintained a sacramental structure, and a hierarchical structure, and a basic theology.
*02:04:49-02:04:57*

And even the seven ecumenical councils, which is, I don't know how could they possibly claim that, but anyway, they have all these things in common, supposedly.
*02:04:57-02:05:05*

Someone said that he believes that these heterodox can be received by a simple confession of faith into the church.
*02:05:05-02:05:11*

Well, the question of reception is a different issue, but we'll talk about that.
*02:05:11-02:05:17*

But let's start with apostolic secession.
*02:05:17-02:05:19*

It is impossible to talk about apostolic secession in the Orthodox manner, I don't know if you actually understand apostolic secession, apart from the apostolic faith.
*02:05:20-02:05:27*

What's passed on is not simply a laying on of hands, as if in a legalistic manner, and that's what goes on in the West.
*02:05:27-02:05:34*

People think very naively that if you just do the actions, like the papal legalist scholastics somehow thought that this is some kind of magical, legalistic thing you pass on without having the faith.
*02:05:34-02:05:47*

Like they said you could be an atheist or a Jew and baptize, which is absurd.
*02:05:48-02:05:52*

But they believe that, they have canons that defend that.
*02:05:53-02:05:55*

Same thing about Apostolic Decession.
*02:05:55-02:05:56*

You can just pass it on mechanically, magically, without confession of the one faith and the revelation of Jesus Christ.
*02:05:56-02:06:04*

It is impossible.
*02:06:04-02:06:04*

In other words, that's impossible.
*02:06:04-02:06:05*

So first of all, Apostolic Decession is impossible outside of the Apostolic faith, or the Orthodox faith.
*02:06:06-02:06:11*

The Eucharist is the church.
*02:06:12-02:06:15*

The church is the Eucharist.
*02:06:16-02:06:17*

These things are synonymous.
*02:06:17-02:06:18*

It's impossible to talk about the Eucharist outside the context of all the mysteries.
*02:06:19-02:06:23*

So the minute you say the Eucharist is there, everything is there.
*02:06:23-02:06:26*

And therefore there's one church.
*02:06:27-02:06:28*

And therefore we have a church that's totally opposed and in confusion.
*02:06:29-02:06:35*

It's been divided for centuries and centuries.
*02:06:35-02:06:38*

And right now, we're gravely sinning because we refuse to commune with one another.
*02:06:39-02:06:44*

The implications of these ideas are really, at the end of the day, they become absurd.
*02:06:46-02:06:52*

And of course, no church father ever taught any such thing.
*02:06:52-02:06:55*

No church father, no saint.
*02:06:56-02:06:57*

Saint Paisios, who we just quoted, never.
*02:06:57-02:06:59*

And rejected the idea that there was one church, and they're all just the Orthodox and Monophysites and not anti-Theologians or Orthodox.
*02:07:00-02:07:07*

The saints don't teach this.
*02:07:08-02:07:09*

We don't have any saints today, whoever said such a thing.
*02:07:09-02:07:12*

So this idea that the Eucharist is there, of course, means the church is there, but that's not what the church has ever understood.
*02:07:12-02:07:19*

We don't have to confess.
*02:07:20-02:07:20*

We don't have any miracle counsel to confess that.
*02:07:20-02:07:22*

The opposite has been taught.
*02:07:22-02:07:24*

Have those who do not know live and uniformly confess in word and deed theosis retain basic theology?
*02:07:25-02:07:33*

The idea is that there's a basic theology, the basic theology.
*02:07:34-02:07:37*

What does that mean?
*02:07:37-02:07:37*

Basically, they're like advanced theology and basic theology.
*02:07:38-02:07:41*

It's one seamless garment.
*02:07:41-02:07:43*

I don't know what that could mean.
*02:07:43-02:07:44*

So if you doubt or do not confess and live and promote theosis as salvation, which is what the church fathers have always taught, God became man, that man ought to become God.
*02:07:44-02:07:55*

The whole of the Philokalia of hesychast refutation is all about this as salvation.
*02:07:55-02:08:00*

That's not the case among the Copts and the various Antichrist Alcedonians.
*02:08:01-02:08:05*

It's not the case among the Papists.
*02:08:05-02:08:07*

Of course, some in those confessions believe that there is such a thing as theosis, but the general, you know, the vast majority and the core of their spiritual life does not admit that, does not teach and preach that, does not cultivate that, and has not.
*02:08:07-02:08:24*

So that is a sign that, of course, the theology and the teaching of the Ecumenical Councils is not present in those confessions.
*02:08:24-02:08:34*

And Father John Romanides and others have said that very clearly.
*02:08:34-02:08:37*

Finally, the criteria for the reception of the heterodox is not based on theological proximity to orthodoxy.
*02:08:38-02:08:44*

So this idea that, well, they're really close to us, and therefore we do confession of faith is wrong.
*02:08:45-02:08:49*

That's not the patristic teaching.
*02:08:50-02:08:51*

That's not what St.
*02:08:51-02:08:52*

Nicodemus says in his pedallion.
*02:08:52-02:08:54*

It's not what St.
*02:08:54-02:08:55*

Basil said.
*02:08:55-02:08:55*

Nobody, you cannot come to that conclusion because you have Arians received in a way that really, I mean, Arians should have been baptized.
*02:08:55-02:09:03*

if that's the way we think about heresy, because it's a grievous, gross heresy.
*02:09:03-02:09:08*

But that's not what happens. Some are baptized, some are chrismated in the ancient church. The vast majority of them are baptized, by the way.
*02:09:09-02:09:15*

And Canaan 95, actually, as we'll see in a minute, points to baptism, not the confession of faith for the monophysites. And we'll explain why that's the case in a minute.
*02:09:16-02:09:26*

But, uh, "economia" is possible, of course.
*02:09:26-02:09:32*

It's always possible to be, for the church to do "economia".
*02:09:32-02:09:34*

Nobody denies that, but on what basis and what presupposition and what did the actual church fathers say?
*02:09:34-02:09:40*

Uh, quickly, I'm not going to go through the whole thing, but Canon 95 of Trullo, properly understood and translated, speaks about baptism for the Nestorians and the disciples of "Peptikias, Dioscoros, and Severus".
*02:09:41-02:09:55*

That's what's properly understood when you read the canon.
*02:09:56-02:09:59*

That's what is even confessed and read by Emika Alevizatos, who was a pretty active ecumenist of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.
*02:10:00-02:10:10*

That's his reading of this canon as well.
*02:10:10-02:10:11*

So these heresies are also to be treated as Greeks and baptized.
*02:10:13-02:10:17*

This is according to Father John Patrick Ramsey, a cleric and scholar from England in the Russian Orthodox Church outside of Russia.
*02:10:18-02:10:24*

He did a very interesting piece, you can find it in Academia, I've got the source here.
*02:10:25-02:10:29*

Go and read it and see the proper understanding of 95.
*02:10:30-02:10:32*

The version in the "Patrologia Greca", along with the commentary of Theodora Bausman, puts a full stop at the end of this sentence after similar heresies.
*02:10:33-02:10:44*

In other words, it is proper to see "stop" and then "it is necessary to make documents" and then "anathemize the heresy".
*02:10:44-02:10:51*

In other words, they continue in the same vein as the previously referenced heretics who were to be baptized.
*02:10:51-02:10:58*

So actually the canon explicitly says that they should be baptized according to the reading of Father John, Amica Alegrizatos, Theodore Bauserman, and the grammar and the proper understanding and translation of the canon.
*02:10:59-02:11:14*

Now this is, for some, this is going to be revolutionary because they have been told again and again and again, no, no, no, the canon says that they should be received by a simple confession of faith, and that's not what the canon says.
*02:11:14-02:11:26*

But I know there are people who say that that's not true, but I think there's a very good case for it.
*02:11:26-02:11:32*

Now, interestingly, if we put things in historical context, about the same time that Baal-Samson writing, and now we've got 600 years after the councils for dealing with the Monophysites, you have a canon in a Georgian council, Canon 15, in 1103 AD, the Georgians have a council and they talk about how to receive converts from the Armenians. The Armenians, of course, were not in communion with the Orthodox.
*02:11:32-02:12:06*

they rejected the Fourth Ecumenical Council, and they tragically embraced the theology of the Monophysites and other problematic theology.
*02:12:06-02:12:16*

Listen what this canon says, and it is totally in agreement with this reading of Canon 95 we just quoted, and Baal Semmon regarding the various Eastern groups that have been anathematized, the Nestorians and the Jacobites.
*02:12:16-02:12:32*

Those of the Armenian adherents of the Kashet-Sal formula, who convert to the right and pure faith, and wish to join the holy and Catholic Church, and condemn the abominable heresy of one nature, which proclaims in its ignorance that Christ our true God has one will and one operation, being a union of mingled human and divine natures, and therefore neither divine nor human, but something mingled and strange, for them we declare to be baptized in full, like pagans.
*02:12:32-02:13:11*

For this is the way great churches, such as the Antiochian Patriarchate (Balsemon) and other Eastern churches, accept them." This is a very important historical witness, again, to the proper reading of Canon 95.
*02:13:13-02:13:27*

If Canaanite 5 was talking about reception by confession of faith, trulo, they would have known that, Antioch would have known that, this canon wouldn't have said they should be baptized according to the great churches in the east. So a proper reading of Canaanite 5, what the Antiochian church was doing under Baalsman, and now you have the Georgian church, of course, not a lot of politics involved here, this is pretty straightforward, they don't have anything, they're high, there's no reason for them to to do, you know, I zealotry on their part. This is just the way they had been passed down to them.
*02:13:28-02:14:03*

Because of time, I'm not going to read this, but I highly recommend you go online if you're interested in this topic. You want to go fuller. Read a very important document issued, I think it was in 2008, called "A Confession of Faith Against Ecumenism." There were about eight or nine bishops who signed it. I think it was 12,000 people signed at the time, hundreds of clergy from different Orthodox churches.
*02:14:04-02:14:27*

It's online at the Jordanville.org files article slash a confession of faith PDF.
*02:14:28-02:14:35*

You can go read that. Very important document signed by many prominent confessors of the faith in Greece at the time, Father Theodoros Zissas, Father Jordan Vitaly Novos, and many others.
*02:14:35-02:14:45*

So I'm not going to read it right here, but he clearly is clearly supporting everything we've talked about tonight, obviously, And that, you know, it's a very, very grave matter that every Orthodox Christian has to be engaged in and confess the faith in belief in the one Church, the one Holy Catholic Apostolic Church.
*02:14:45-02:15:08*

Now, all of this that we've talked about tonight is not an end in itself.
*02:15:08-02:15:12*

It's not going to end with a compromise simply between the Orthodox and some heterodox.
*02:15:13-02:15:19*

But it is already developed far beyond the realm of inter-Christian ecumenism, and now we're in pan-religious ecumenism.
*02:15:19-02:15:27*

And there's probably a whole other talk we could give just on what's happening in this sphere.
*02:15:27-02:15:31*

But I will end as I did a couple of weeks ago, again, with this famous quote and this very important interpretation of the Book of Revelation by Elder Athanasios of Thessalonians, who tells us that this grave temptation of ecumenism is leading us to an acceptance, in other words, the various heretical groups among the ecumenists are going to embrace and accept the idea that there are many paths up the mountain, there are many religions that will save, and there will be a persecution of those who refuse to accept this idea.
*02:15:33-02:16:05*

And he says, this great and grave temptation is the last temptation of history.
*02:16:06-02:16:12*

"And this unity will be experienced as a grave temptation, which will visit the Church worldwide, for it will obscure, in order to set aside, the theanthropic person of Jesus Christ, and his body, the Church, both the person and the body." will set aside, it will obscure.
*02:16:12-02:16:44*

It's already happened.
*02:16:44-02:16:45*

It's been happening for 100 years.
*02:16:45-02:16:46*

This will be the last temptation of history.
*02:16:47-02:16:49*

It has been prophesied by Christ himself in the book of Revelation.
*02:16:53-02:16:55*

He says "thou hast kept the word of my patience" -- talking to the angel, the bishop -- "I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, try them that dwell upon the earth." So what is this grave temptation that will be universal, that try everyone on the face of the earth?
*02:16:57-02:17:21*

Elder Athanasius tells us, "Because this temptation will affect the entire world, it will be the great adulteration of faith in the theanthropic person of Jesus Christ." This is what it's all about, brothers and sisters.
*02:17:22-02:17:34*

It's all about leading to an obscuring of the person of Christ, because He is the one who saves, it's through Him that we are saved.
*02:17:34-02:17:42*

Everything we talked about tonight, from the distortion of economy and ecrivia, to the distortion of where a baptism is, where the mysteries are, the whole question of the nature of the unity of the church, the nature of the church, everything we talked about, is leading humanity toward an obscuring distortion of the person of Christ, and therefore a cutting off of humanity from salvation in Jesus Christ in the body of Christ, His church, and this is where we have to be so much on guard, and why this topic is extremely important for all of us.
*02:17:43-02:18:17*

We have to be sensitized.
*02:18:17-02:18:19*

We have to read.
*02:18:19-02:18:19*

We have to be cognizant of what the church fathers have taught, and we have to help others so that they do not fall into this grave temptation, which is coming upon the face of the earth, and they escape and they maintain their faith in the person of Jesus Christ and in His church.
*02:18:19-02:18:36*

And with that, I've gone over my time quite a bit.
*02:18:37-02:18:40*

I'm sorry.
*02:18:40-02:18:41*

I'm glad that you're being patient and you stayed with me.
*02:18:41-02:18:45*

And hopefully this has been very beneficial, very much a building up of your Orthodox antibodies, your Christian antibodies against the various delusions and heresies that we're facing today.
*02:18:45-02:18:59*

I should say also, just in closing, we can open up to questions, John, and maybe you've been collecting them.
*02:19:00-02:19:06*

I don't know, but I've got a few questions.
*02:19:06-02:19:08*

If you want to ask questions, if you're in Facebook or in YouTube, you can submit it there.
*02:19:08-02:19:22*

John Kaufman there is ready to receive the questions.
*02:19:22-02:19:26*

Put maybe an all caps question and then ask your question.
*02:19:26-02:19:31*

Somebody just asked John, limited hangout has a question here, so put those over there in my list, and we'll get to them ASAP.
*02:19:32-02:19:40*

But I should say that, you know, for all of those who have difficulty grasping the ecclesiology, I know sometimes some of those things are very kind of complex for us.
*02:19:41-02:19:50*

Don't worry about it.
*02:19:50-02:19:51*

But, and for those who object and don't agree with what's been presented tonight, consider the fact today that everyone who desires to follow Christ, for the most part, who are trying to be faithful, they understand the grave attack upon the institution of marriage, or just the person, the genders and the nature of men and women today, the grave attack on this mystery of union in Christ in marriage.
*02:19:52-02:20:27*

Everyone should understand that.
*02:20:29-02:20:30*

And yet this is just another, this is a, on the level of the moral and the social, this is exactly what's taking place in terms of ecumenism.
*02:20:30-02:20:40*

It's an attack on the family of God, it's an attack on the nature of the union with Christ.
*02:20:41-02:20:45*

It's an attack to do away with the mystery of the union of God and man in the church, just like they're attacking the union of God, of man and wife, man and woman in the mystery of marriage.
*02:20:46-02:20:59*

same demonic machinations behind both, to bring an end to our identity in Christ.
*02:20:59-02:21:05*

The fact that people don't even know quite what they are, or they boy, girl, man, woman, is indicative of a long history of not knowing who they are in Christ, not knowing what it means to be in Christ, not knowing who Christ is, and what His body is, and where His body is, which is where we achieve self-knowledge, and we achieve God-knowledge, and we come into communion with God.
*02:21:06-02:21:31*

So, hopefully that very simple example will help you as well.
*02:21:31-02:21:37*

You know, humanism in the name of love has promised much, but when you mixed in with the truth, the pure water, even just a little bit of poison, a little bit of manure, of course, makes the whole source, the whole well, it contaminates all of it.
*02:21:38-02:22:00*

And this is what these lies about the person of Christ and the body of Christ, you know, in the name of love, we're going to unite, but in fact, it's not a true unity.
*02:22:00-02:22:10*

And so it's not true love.
*02:22:11-02:22:12*

And so these lies end up undoing any kind of union, true union in Christ.
*02:22:13-02:22:19*

All right, let's turn to the questions and see what we can do to help you all hopefully understand better the patristic teaching.
*02:22:19-02:22:28*

We'll get rid of this because we're done.
*02:22:31-02:22:32*

And what is the Orthodox understanding of Matthew 18 20?
*02:22:34-02:22:38*

For where two or three are gathered together, my name, there I am in the midst of them.
*02:22:39-02:22:43*

Thank you.
*02:22:43-02:22:44*

Thank you, Drew.
*02:22:44-02:22:44*

Uh, in his name, what does it mean to be in his name?
*02:22:46-02:22:51*

Obviously true unity in Christ is not only in desire or on a theoretical plane or on a, uh, the plane of, uh, of emotions or of thoughts, but True unity in Christ is also necessarily as a physical aspect, does it not?
*02:22:52-02:23:17*

To be in Christ, what does it mean to be in Christ?
*02:23:18-02:23:20*

It clearly says that if you do not eat my body and drink my blood, you have no life in you.
*02:23:21-02:23:26*

You are not mine.
*02:23:26-02:23:27*

And so that is so at the heart of patristic theology and orthodox theology.
*02:23:28-02:23:33*

The physical, material side and the implication of the Incarnation is of course the whole man is going to be saved. The whole man is going to be united to Christ. So to be in His name, to pray in His name, is not just words. I pray in Jesus' name. That's not sufficient, to be in His name. The name means His authority. The name carries with it authority. And of course the authority was given to the apostles. "All authority is given to me in heaven and earth, and I impart to you the binding and the loosing." That is the way He desired for us to work out our salvation, in that body and under the guidance of those apostles, and that Holy Spirit, which again, on the day of Pentecost, the order of things was one mind and one place, one faith and one Eucharist.
*02:23:34-02:24:32*

That's the context of unity in Christ.
*02:24:32-02:24:34*

That's the context of calling upon His name in real life, in real time, and not simply "the name." It's not sufficient to...
*02:24:34-02:24:43*

We don't...
*02:24:43-02:24:44*

In Orthodoxy, you cannot boil things down, minimize them, have just a...
*02:24:44-02:24:48*

It's all together.
*02:24:48-02:24:49*

It's a seamless garment.
*02:24:50-02:24:51*

You can't take that out of context and say, "Oh, well, I'm just going to call upon His name, but I'm not going to be united in any other way to Him." But that will still enable me to be in the presence of God.
*02:24:51-02:25:06*

What's the point of all the rest, if that's the case?
*02:25:08-02:25:10*

If we make this the enemy of the whole, if we take that out of context, out of the context of the life in Christ and the church, we make it an enemy of everything else he's taught and given us.
*02:25:11-02:25:22*

And that would be a tragic distortion.
*02:25:22-02:25:24*

That would be a very heretical way of approaching the mysteries.
*02:25:24-02:25:28*

So this is typically what happens in the Protestant world, is you have portions of scripture taken out of context and interpreted in a very rationalistic way, right?
*02:25:28-02:25:38*

And so then we say, well, in his name means I just call on his name.
*02:25:38-02:25:41*

But the Lord says somewhere else, doesn't he, that you, you know, that you called him Lord, Lord, but you, I don't know you.
*02:25:41-02:25:49*

So he, they were calling on his name.
*02:25:50-02:25:51*

They were saying the name of Jesus, Lord Jesus.
*02:25:52-02:25:54*

And he says, I don't know you.
*02:25:55-02:25:56*

Why doesn't he know you?
*02:25:57-02:25:57*

Because to know Him is to be in communion with Him.
*02:25:58-02:26:00*

To know Him is to be in communion with Him.
*02:26:02-02:26:03*

That's what knowledge in Scripture means, right?
*02:26:03-02:26:05*

It's very intimate.
*02:26:06-02:26:07*

And it's the whole man that's in communion with God, not just our mind, and not just our desire, not just our emotions.
*02:26:07-02:26:15*

The whole man.
*02:26:15-02:26:16*

Okay.
*02:26:18-02:26:18*

Hopefully that answers your question.
*02:26:19-02:26:21*

A little bit of water here, folks.
*02:26:21-02:26:22*

I'm sure you have spoken before about the old calendar versus the new, but I have never heard his thoughts.
*02:26:29-02:26:35*

How did ecumenism lead to a change in our church calendar?
*02:26:38-02:26:42*

So the calendar changed in the West long before the calendar changed among certain Orthodox local churches in the 1920s.
*02:26:44-02:26:54*

And the Orthodox at the time rejected the change partially because the Pope unilaterally did it and partially because the church saw no need to make those changes and there was no changes made in the in the in the civil sphere either.
*02:26:54-02:27:11*

The beginning of the 20th century you have all kinds of pressure coming from the civil civil sphere and through the of various secret societies to bring about a change in the East to bring it in accordance with the West.
*02:27:12-02:27:24*

And so people like Meletios Metaxakis, who was a Mason and was one of the greatest traitors to the Orthodox Church in the history of the Orthodox Church, of sad and tragic memory, somebody who persecuted saints like St.
*02:27:25-02:27:39*

Meletarios, this is the tragic person who then is chosen by the people of this to bring about a change which had not been secured on a pan-Orthodox level.
*02:27:39-02:27:53*

In fact, just years before Metaxakis convened his little Congress in 1923, which had about 15 people, and then in the name of that Congress, he said, "We're gonna make this change "to be in conformity with Western civil society "and the heterodox." It was particularly for this, that in the context of his desire for ecumenical relations, And after the 1920 Encyclical, he wants to bring the Orthodox in conformity and unity.
*02:27:54-02:28:21*

It's very specific.
*02:28:22-02:28:22*

He wants to break down the barriers, break down the walls, just like we heard about in this presentation tonight between the Protestants.
*02:28:23-02:28:29*

So he's in that same spirit.
*02:28:30-02:28:31*

But before that, just years before that, previous patriarchs says, we don't need a change.
*02:28:31-02:28:36*

There's nothing that forces us to change.
*02:28:36-02:28:38*

It doesn't matter if the civil is different than the ecclesiastical.
*02:28:38-02:28:41*

We don't need to do that, because rightfully, even if there were other motivations, he's saying the truth that ecclesiologically there's no basis, and it's not wise, and it's pastorally a disaster to change it piecemeal.
*02:28:41-02:28:56*

The Orthodox Church doesn't do such massive changes to their inner life piecemeal.
*02:28:57-02:29:01*

Like, it doesn't matter if one church is on a different calendar than the other.
*02:29:01-02:29:05*

And of course, this led to chaos in the Western world, in the so-called diaspora, where we have Orthodox literally down the street from one another on different church calendars in terms of the, in terms of the Menaean, in terms of the celebration of the saints.
*02:29:05-02:29:19*

So Metaxaki goes ahead, unilaterally does it, and then there's pressure for the church of Greece to do it.
*02:29:20-02:29:25*

And then little by little churches like Romania later on, and then Bulgaria much later, and then the Patriarch of Antioch, I think, I'm not sure, but pretty much a couple of decades later, I think, they changed to the new calendar.
*02:29:25-02:29:39*

Whereas most Orthodox today are still on the so-called old calendar, Church calendar.
*02:29:40-02:29:45*

It never changed.
*02:29:45-02:29:46*

Russia, Georgia, Serbia, Patriarchate of Jerusalem, they never changed.
*02:29:46-02:29:51*

And so this is a major reason why the Orthodox Church should have a true Orthodox Council.
*02:29:51-02:29:58*

And I think that what we're called upon to do is to repent of this divisive change, which did not have to happen, and was ecclesiologically unjustified, and the motivations were not pure, and the consideration of church unity was not taken into consideration.
*02:29:59-02:30:19*

Having said that, the fact that there are millions of Orthodox Christians without their desire having to follow a calendar which was introduced by a Mason and a traitor to the Orthodox Church does not mean we should punish these Orthodox Christians and act as if because of that they're heretics or schismatics.
*02:30:19-02:30:36*

So the methodology of resisting this innovation needs to be patristic.
*02:30:36-02:30:42*

And I do believe that the old calendarists who chose to resist by breaking communion and then eventually getting to the point where they denied the grace of God in the local church.
*02:30:42-02:30:52*

I think this is a grave error.
*02:30:52-02:30:54*

It has not solved or helped solve the grave error committed in the first place by the Mason patriarch.
*02:30:54-02:31:02*

And so, you know, we need to be conscientious that it was an error.
*02:31:02-02:31:09*

We also need to realize that pastorally, there's a lot of need for patience.
*02:31:09-02:31:14*

And there are people in difficult situations.
*02:31:15-02:31:17*

There's not going to be easily for those people to change back to it, the old calendar, and it's not a dogmatic question, although it does undermine church unity and church order.
*02:31:17-02:31:28*

And in that sense, it's a very serious and grave question.
*02:31:28-02:31:31*

But it would be an error for us to essentially do more damage to church unity by making it into a church-dividing issue, which it's not.
*02:31:32-02:31:44*

What should happen is those people who, and all of us, who sat by and allow ourselves to be divided first liturgically, and then others to be divided into so-called "old calendarists," and then eventually there's an indifference on the part of church hierarchy.
*02:31:44-02:32:03*

I don't know how else to call it.
*02:32:03-02:32:05*

I mean, there is no need for that to happen.
*02:32:05-02:32:08*

We should have said for the sake of those who refuse it, we will not go ahead and make the change.
*02:32:08-02:32:14*

And there should have been a pan-Orthodox decision.
*02:32:15-02:32:16*

So that's my two words on calendar change.
*02:32:16-02:32:20*

I think the royal path is to pray for and work for a reversal and a pan-Orthodox decision.
*02:32:20-02:32:29*

And in the meantime, to be pastorally sensitive and patient for those who obviously had never made a choice to go along with the change and they're on the new calendar in their Orthodox Christians, St. Philotheus Zeravakos is a very good person to listen to and to read on this question.
*02:32:30-02:32:51*

He has kept the royal path, in my opinion.
*02:32:51-02:32:53*

Next question.
*02:32:54-02:32:54*

What are your general thoughts on views on Israel and Judaism within Orthodoxy compared to the very positive views in the United States Protestant towards them?
*02:32:58-02:33:05*

Is their expectation of future unity of Judaism and Christianity misguided what's behind it?
*02:33:06-02:33:10*

Uh, we have, uh, in the Orthodox Church, no expectation of unity between Judaism, ISM at the end and Christianity, I T Y.
*02:33:11-02:33:23*

First of all, we don't talk about Christianity unless we're talking sociologically and historically.
*02:33:24-02:33:29*

The church, the body of Christ, this exists, and this is what we are.
*02:33:30-02:33:36*

We're members of the body of Christ, and it's a particular and very clear identity, but a religion called Christianity, I don't know, and I don't ascribed to.
*02:33:36-02:33:49*

And Judaism as a religion that it rejects the Messiah and our Lord Jesus Christ will never be united to the church.
*02:33:50-02:33:57*

Now, having said that, I think you mean the return, which is prophesied by the apostle Paul and is expected at the end times when there will be preachers come down sent by God, the Elias and Enoch, and he will preach repentance to the Jews who are still seeking and open to the Messiah, and they will repent and they embrace the Messiah and become Christians, that will certainly happen in the last days.
*02:33:58-02:34:24*

That will happen regardless of what the Protestants do politically to bring about anything.
*02:34:25-02:34:30*

This delusion on their part that they're going to bring about the return of Christ quicker or the reign of Christ on earth quicker is just a tragic, tragic delusion.
*02:34:30-02:34:40*

As far as our thoughts on Israel and Judaism within Orthodoxy, I'm not really sure what that's pointing to. I mean, you could talk a lot about Judaism post-Christ. Of course, the new sacred texts post-Christ, the ones that took on the greater meaning for Judaism, not the Pentateuch, not the prophets, but all the commentary on the prophets and the Bender, that, unfortunately, blasphemes our Lord and the mother of God.
*02:34:41-02:35:23*

And so what can we say except to reject it, reject those idea teachings?
*02:35:23-02:35:27*

But beyond that, I'm not really sure what you're asking.
*02:35:30-02:35:33*

We don't have a developed political ideology, theology, about the state of Israel, not something that the Orthodox have spent much time, certainly not like the Protestants, that I know of, in my experience.
*02:35:33-02:35:49*

So, next question.
*02:35:49-02:35:50*

Father, since Christ is the Church, and we are become the body of the Church, is participation in the sacraments, the Eucharist, the Theosis, related to Saint Paul saying God will be all in all?
*02:35:51-02:36:04*

So our participation in the body of Christ makes us, of course, members.
*02:36:06-02:36:11*

And in Dinami, potentially, we become glorified.
*02:36:12-02:36:17*

That's a decision essentially made by God, depending on our disposition to struggle.
*02:36:17-02:36:22*

Our life is mainly led through the path of purification and God willing to illumination, and that's where most of us will remain in our life, struggling to allow God to purify us and remain pure, and in communion with the grace of God, and enlightened by God.
*02:36:23-02:36:41*

That whole process of salvation is God willing being worked out by the Holy Spirit in us, in our life in the church.
*02:36:42-02:36:49*

And in that sense, we seek that Christ will be all in all, through the mysteries and through our participation in the body of Christ.
*02:36:50-02:36:59*

And that hopefully we will be able to say, Like St. Paul says, "It is not I, but Christ, who lives in me." Next question.
*02:36:59-02:37:07*

Which Bible should I use?
*02:37:08-02:37:09*

Which versions does Fr. Peter use?
*02:37:10-02:37:12*

I don't read Greek to which English language version.
*02:37:12-02:37:15*

So, I've said this many times.
*02:37:15-02:37:17*

I'll say it very quickly.
*02:37:17-02:37:18*

I like in English one particular two-volume edition, which is mainly for study, and not necessarily for reading as much.
*02:37:19-02:37:29*

It's a bit cumbersome, and it's not King James English, but it is still, I think, fairly good.
*02:37:29-02:37:34*

But it's very more literal, and it's good for studying, because it has patristic text in the background, in the back with notes, and explains why it translates things as it does.
*02:37:35-02:37:45*

And it shows you in the Church Fathers' usages many times, St. John of Sostom, how he used and understood passages, and therefore they translate on the basis of the interpretation of Church Fathers, which is, I think, not very common.
*02:37:45-02:37:58*

And that version is called the Orthodox New Testament.
*02:37:58-02:38:02*

It's two volumes and it's by a monastery in, let's see if we can get that, the Orthodox New Testament Acts, Epistles and Revelation.
*02:38:04-02:38:13*

This is volume two.
*02:38:13-02:38:14*

And it's by the monastery Dormition Skeet and the Holy Apostles Convent in Buena Vista, Colorado.
*02:38:15-02:38:22*

I think there's a scholar.
*02:38:22-02:38:23*

I'm not sure who does it exactly, but there is a scholar of some sort there.
*02:38:24-02:38:27*

a woman, I think, but I don't know for sure.
*02:38:28-02:38:30*

She is very prolific.
*02:38:30-02:38:31*

And I just, I appreciate again, that they go to lengths to explain their translation.
*02:38:32-02:38:38*

They base it on the fathers.
*02:38:38-02:38:39*

And key terms are explained well, for instance, you know, in the King James, just to give you one example, it talks about repentance of Judas, that Judas repented, actually that's not accurate.
*02:38:40-02:38:53*

He had remorse, metamelia in Greek.
*02:38:54-02:38:57*

He didn't have "metania," he didn't have repentance.
*02:38:57-02:39:00*

So the book here, they translate it properly, of course, and they explain the translation, and they cite the various versions of the scriptures, including the New Testament of King James, where it goes wrong, where it's true to the Greek.
*02:39:00-02:39:12*

And I think that there are, of course, other things out there that you can pick up and be very benefit from.
*02:39:12-02:39:18*

The Orthodox Study Bible, many people have that, use that.
*02:39:18-02:39:20*

I don't know much about it, but I never really used it, but perhaps you should check that out as well.
*02:39:20-02:39:27*

I think there's another version out by New Rome Press, which is another attempt.
*02:39:27-02:39:30*

But I don't think they have patristic commentary.
*02:39:31-02:39:32*

So when I study, I want to make sure I have the father's and I'm following the father's interpretation of the scriptures.
*02:39:33-02:39:38*

Next question.
*02:39:41-02:39:42*

Father, you use the term the Orthodox ecumenist.
*02:39:42-02:39:45*

Isn't that an oxymoron?
*02:39:45-02:39:46*

We are either Orthodox and embrace the correct faith or we are not.
*02:39:47-02:39:50*

Correct?
*02:39:50-02:39:50*

Well, of course, of course it's correct.
*02:39:51-02:39:53*

literally it's impossible to be an ecumenist in the sense of embracing the ecclesiological heresy, but we can talk about it for lack of, for ease of reference, because we have people who are in the Orthodox Church yet to be condemned by a council, so therefore they've not, their position has not been vacated, has not been defrocked, they've not been communicated, and therefore before the mysteries are not doubted, before a council.
*02:39:54-02:40:25*

There is no basis for me to speak as if they are outside the church.
*02:40:26-02:40:32*

They are heretics, or preaching heresy, as they say.
*02:40:33-02:40:35*

They are not condemned heretics.
*02:40:35-02:40:36*

They are preaching heresy.
*02:40:37-02:40:37*

We believe that the patristic teaching is that every time we depart from the faith, we trample upon the canons and the teachings of the fathers, of course, We ourselves are aliens, and we become estranged from the Spirit of God, Spirit of Truth, for ourselves, right?
*02:40:38-02:40:56*

We, there's immediately, without any canon ever having to be employed, that person is in delusion and is falling away.
*02:40:57-02:41:05*

And unless they repent, unless they come back to the right faith, then they're going to be not counted among the saved.
*02:41:05-02:41:13*

Now, having said that, the canons do not employ themselves.
*02:41:13-02:41:17*

They do not automatically get employed.
*02:41:17-02:41:19*

And it was very clear that the canons have to be applied.
*02:41:19-02:41:24*

The canons are not laws that immediately go into effect for the sake of the church as a, administratively and in terms of ecclesiology.
*02:41:25-02:41:35*

Imagine if that were the case, what chaos would ensue.
*02:41:37-02:41:41*

The Church, the binding and the loosing is given to the Apostles.
*02:41:41-02:41:47*

They have to apply it.
*02:41:47-02:41:50*

And that's why the departure of the various zealot/old calendarist groups from the communion of the Church before Council, I believe, is a mythological error.
*02:41:51-02:42:01*

I think it's not what the Fathers would have done and do.
*02:42:01-02:42:04*

I don't think our Saints today did it.
*02:42:04-02:42:06*

St. Paisios, St. Porphyrios, St. Iacobos, St. Gabriel of Georgia, St. Justin Popovic.
*02:42:06-02:42:13*

Tell me one of our celebrated saints who confessed to faith, opposed ecumenism, did they depart from the Church because there were others who had fallen away?
*02:42:14-02:42:23*

No, they did not.
*02:42:24-02:42:25*

They did not depart.
*02:42:26-02:42:27*

And they did not suppose that because their bishops or theologians around them were in delusion and preaching heresy, therefore the church that they're a part of is no longer the Church of Christ. Those things have happened again and again and throughout Church history, and there's this gray area between when the heresy appears and when it's condemned that we live in. It's happened with Arianism, it's happened with Monophysitism, it's happened with Monothelitism, it's happened with Iconoclasm, it's happened with the papal false councils. There is this difficult period which we must struggle to confess the faith and be patient for the sake of the church to rule in counsel. Only the voice of the church in counsel can therefore apply the canons and therefore defrock if the person...
*02:42:27-02:43:16*

The other thing is the person has to be given ultimately, I mean at least legally, has to be given the chance to repent. The church has to say in counsel, "What you teach is heresy. Repent." Some did repent in church history. They didn't lose their seat. They weren't considered all the ordinations they did, they weren't considered to be invalid or, you know, non-existent, because the church and Christ gives and is given in every mystery. It's not dependent upon the sinful priest or bishop. Again, this gray area is hard for a lot of people to get their head around, and they think that because someone starts preaching heresy they must depart not just from that person, which would be praiseworthy, but from the whole communion that he's still of the church that he's still a part of.
*02:43:16-02:44:04*

That's an error. We don't depart from Christ because somebody has fallen.
*02:44:04-02:44:08*

Twelve apostles, eleven apostles didn't depart from Christ because Judas was in their midst. You know, Peter repented. If we would have said, "Peter, you have deny Christ, you are no longer, you know, we're going to assume that you're, there's no hope, you're gone.
*02:44:09-02:44:27*

There would be no, I mean, he repented.
*02:44:27-02:44:30*

These various teachers of delusion and the humanism can repent and we pray for that.
*02:44:31-02:44:37*

So you see the royal path here, I think this is the royal path.
*02:44:38-02:44:41*

Fight, struggle, confess, do not depart from the other Orthodox.
*02:44:42-02:44:46*

Oppose those who introduced a new teaching.
*02:44:47-02:44:49*

So to say orthodox or cuminous is to recognize this weird and difficult situation, that they're still a part of the orthodox church, even though they've fallen away personally teaching heresy, and therefore, of course, cuminism and orthodoxy are like oil and water, of course.
*02:44:49-02:45:08*

But it's got to be applied by the canons for that particular person to be removed.
*02:45:09-02:45:14*

And that doesn't happen in our day and age.
*02:45:14-02:45:15*

You might say, well, when's it going to happen?
*02:45:16-02:45:17*

Why?
*02:45:17-02:45:17*

Trust in God.
*02:45:18-02:45:19*

Trust in God. You want answers before the time.
*02:45:20-02:45:22*

What would they have said?
*02:45:23-02:45:25*

Post-First Ecumenical Council, 60 years of confusion, you had Arianism.
*02:45:26-02:45:30*

What did they say?
*02:45:30-02:45:31*

They ran to the Orthodox, and they prayed, and they waited for God to intervene.
*02:45:31-02:45:37*

And He brought that about with St. Gregory the Theologian, and that's in Constantinople, and the Second Ecumenical Council.
*02:45:37-02:45:44*

You know, if you were living in Constantinople, I've said this before, before the Second Intermediate Council, you would have said, "It's over. It's history." Because there was one church that was Orthodox, and there was a little chapel, and there was one preacher of Orthodoxy, and that was St. Gregory the Theologian.
*02:45:44-02:45:57*

And everybody else were Aryans, because that was the politically correct thing to do, when you had an Aryan emperor over your head. And then he was removed, Theodosius came in, called the Second Intermediate Council, and by then, by God's grace and providence, the whole of the city of Constantinople embraced orthodoxy, in large part because of St. Gregory the Theologian's witness.
*02:45:58-02:46:22*

So it is a strange reality we live in, I.V., that we have to realize it and walk the moral path.
*02:46:23-02:46:30*

And God help us, you know, to recognize both hands, right?
*02:46:31-02:46:36*

On one hand the Church, and on the other hand the ecumenists.
*02:46:36-02:46:39*

And not be confused who's who.
*02:46:39-02:46:40*

Father, do you think that when the Scripture talks about the wheat and the tares, it refers to the dynamic we have going on today? Orthodox believers and ecumenists coexist together in the Church. Well, not just now, but throughout Church history this has been. I just explained all that, so I'm not going to go into it. This is the reality. Yes, in many ways this is the case.
*02:46:42-02:46:59*

And it's, you know, it's really impossible in many ways, humanly.
*02:47:01-02:47:07*

And again, Christ intercedes and Christ saved the Church again and again and again throughout Church history.
*02:47:07-02:47:15*

So St. Maximus proposed 20 years later that he had the Ecumenical Council that justified it.
*02:47:16-02:47:21*

So it will be Christ who will save us once again, as He always does.
*02:47:22-02:47:26*

And it will be, however, He can't do it without us wanting to be saved.
*02:47:26-02:47:32*

So our confession of faith, our suffering for the Sacred Christ, our risking everything for the Sacred Christ is, if not a prerequisite, it certainly seems to pre go before the intervention of Christ throughout church history. So you can't be indifferent and expect Christ to do everything. You have to confess, you have to suffer, you have to have martyrs perhaps, confessors, and all the rest.
*02:47:32-02:47:58*

So this is the reality we're in.
*02:47:59-02:48:02*

We're in this very difficult reality until the Lord intervenes, and orthodoxy again is victorious over the various delusions that have been introduced.
*02:48:02-02:48:15*

As a catechumen, what internal signs should I look for that would tell me that I'm ready to be baptized?
*02:48:16-02:48:22*

Well normally, James, you wouldn't look for anything.
*02:48:24-02:48:26*

spiritual guide would tell you you're going to be baptized.
*02:48:27-02:48:29*

You're not going to determine the date. Now having said that, I don't know who your spiritual guide is, I don't know any priest, and I can't speak to that, but I do know that the nature of the church in places like America and other places that I have a little experience with is that there aren't always very experienced spiritual guides, and so they don't necessarily make the right decision about when somebody is ready to be baptized. But generally speaking, I would say that when someone has arrived to have acquired the Orthodox way in terms of daily prayer, fasting, keeping the fast, keeping the prayer rule, making progress with combating the thoughts, making progress in concentrating on the prayer, making progress in putting away all the old habits, the immoralities, the sexual impurities.
*02:48:30-02:49:25*

Obviously, that's got to be all behind you.
*02:49:26-02:49:27*

All those things that are obstacles to the grace of God being energized at your baptism, those things are removed, and you're on a state, you're stabilized, and you're praying, and you're fasting, and you're obedient, and you've learned to love the church and the church services, then you're probably getting close to being able to be baptized.
*02:49:28-02:49:48*

You don't want to go and be baptized when you're still struggling with basic moral, spiritual things, because the grace of God cannot be energized when we're actively opposed to His presence in our life.
*02:49:48-02:50:03*

If we're engaged in sexual impurities, we're engaged in drug abuse, we're engaged in infidelities of any kind, or why?
*02:50:04-02:50:13*

Any of that gross immorality, obviously, do not approach the mystery.
*02:50:13-02:50:18*

If you don't like being in church, you don't like sitting in your prayer room and doing your prayer rule, you don't like reading the daily scriptures and church fathers and lives of the saints, and you don't really have much zeal for that, that's a sign you're not ready to be baptized.
*02:50:18-02:50:35*

So the life shouldn't change drastically when you're baptized.
*02:50:36-02:50:40*

You should be prepared to live that life, already living it.
*02:50:40-02:50:43*

You proved yourself, that you're living it, before you are baptized.
*02:50:43-02:50:48*

You don't have to know everything about everything.
*02:50:50-02:50:51*

You don't have to know all the church history and dogmas and ecumenical councils.
*02:50:51-02:50:55*

That's not a part of catechism.
*02:50:55-02:50:56*

Of course, embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, and you need to make progress, mainly in the way of Christ.
*02:50:57-02:51:05*

To put on the yoke of Christ.
*02:51:05-02:51:07*

To embrace the cross of Christ.
*02:51:08-02:51:09*

This is what we need to be in order to make the grace of baptism energized in our life.
*02:51:10-02:51:15*

I have a question.
*02:51:17-02:51:18*

What about the thief on the cross, as he was not baptized?
*02:51:18-02:51:21*

I did mention that in my whole talk, but it's a question others ask me a lot.
*02:51:23-02:51:28*

How is he, in exception to the rule, commanded to receive baptism?
*02:51:28-02:51:31*

Yeah, that's a great question.
*02:51:32-02:51:34*

I do address that repeatedly in my talks, whenever I talk about the question.
*02:51:34-02:51:37*

So that's exactly pointing to what true "economia" is.
*02:51:39-02:51:43*

So "economy" in Greek means "management of the household," basically.
*02:51:44-02:51:48*

It's basically the economy of salvation is the whole plan and wisdom and carrying out of our salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.
*02:51:49-02:51:59*

That continues through the Church.
*02:51:59-02:52:01*

It doesn't end with His Incarnation and Ascension.
*02:52:01-02:52:03*

He sends the Spirit.
*02:52:04-02:52:05*

He dwells with us.
*02:52:05-02:52:06*

He guides us.
*02:52:06-02:52:07*

the apostles and the preachers. And that same economy of salvation is being worked out according to "exactitude," as it is revealed in the Scriptures and the Fathers.
*02:52:07-02:52:20*

There's the norm, the 99% of the time way the church works. You are baptized, you are catechized, everything else. And then you have those exceptions. There's always exceptions.
*02:52:20-02:52:32*

And the Lord, of course, is not bound by his exactitude.
*02:52:32-02:52:36*

It's like he's under his law.
*02:52:36-02:52:38*

He gave the law.
*02:52:39-02:52:39*

And so he says, well, in this case, I'm going to give this solution for this particular person and for his salvation.
*02:52:40-02:52:46*

It doesn't overturn the Ecrivia.
*02:52:46-02:52:48*

It doesn't undermine the gospel.
*02:52:48-02:52:50*

If it does, it's not economia.
*02:52:51-02:52:52*

It's not salvation.
*02:52:52-02:52:53*

Economia is good.
*02:52:53-02:52:54*

It's salvation.
*02:52:54-02:52:55*

It's the Lord acting in the midst of the earth to save us from lack of communion, to bring us back to communion.
*02:52:56-02:53:05*

So the thief obviously couldn't descend from the cross and go get baptized, right?
*02:53:06-02:53:12*

Or, I mean, the apostles were baptized, but in any case, that wasn't a possibility.
*02:53:12-02:53:17*

He confessed the Lord.
*02:53:17-02:53:18*

He shed blood, but of course the blood, he wasn't shedding the blood for confessing Christ, but he had that suffering, and of course the Lord accepted him immediately.
*02:53:20-02:53:29*

in paradise. So you have here all the presuppositions for the Lord to accept him in the paradise. He confesses the faith and so the same spiritual reality took place, right? That didn't happen through water, but it happened through the providence and the economy of salvation of God. That's an exception.
*02:53:29-02:53:54*

It does not overturn the rule. We don't cease baptizing people. We don't say it It doesn't matter. None of that happens.
*02:53:54-02:54:01*

It proves the rule, which is the norm, which is baptism, chrismation, communion, etc.
*02:54:02-02:54:09*

"If a chrismated person can get remission of sins and confession and receive the Eucharist, why would they need to get baptized? I just don't get that part.
*02:54:14-02:54:21*

What's missing?" Okay, thanks, Ray.
*02:54:21-02:54:23*

So, there is a and plan that our Lord set into motion.
*02:54:24-02:54:31*

And we seek to carry out every aspect of it, so that we, on our part, are not at all at fault to undermining His economy.
*02:54:32-02:54:40*

So the fact that we realize there's been an error made, the presuppositions didn't exist for that person to be received by chrismation.
*02:54:41-02:54:47*

Chrismation is perfectly possible.
*02:54:48-02:54:50*

Economy is perfectly acceptable.
*02:54:50-02:54:51*

I just went through that, right?
*02:54:51-02:54:53*

But not every time.
*02:54:53-02:54:55*

It depends on the presupposition.
*02:54:55-02:54:57*

It depends on the context.
*02:54:57-02:54:58*

It depends on whether they've kept the form.
*02:54:59-02:55:02*

It depends on a lot of things, right?
*02:55:02-02:55:04*

And spiritually, is there a need?
*02:55:04-02:55:05*

And why do we do it?
*02:55:06-02:55:07*

Are we teaching and preaching people to come to church and be baptized?
*02:55:07-02:55:11*

Or are we just immediately saying it's not necessary?
*02:55:11-02:55:13*

Maybe we have succumbed to this ecumenist lie that mysteries exist outside the one church and people are already initiated into the church somehow some mystically partial way.
*02:55:13-02:55:26*

Okay, so there's things that are undermining the proper application of economy.
*02:55:26-02:55:30*

We recognize that, we realize it was an error.
*02:55:31-02:55:33*

We correct it because we wanna be faithful to Jesus Christ.
*02:55:34-02:55:36*

That's the basic thing.
*02:55:36-02:55:37*

Secondly, the therapy needs to be full.
*02:55:38-02:55:40*

If there's a missing part, if a doctor comes and says to you, "To get well, you've gotta not only take these pills, "but you gotta get rest, "and you gotta drink a lot of water, "and you gotta do, I don't know, whatever else, "like exercise." You say, well, I don't think really I need to take those pills.
*02:55:41-02:55:58*

Do I really?
*02:55:58-02:55:59*

I'm going to go out tonight and spend time, even though I've got a fever.
*02:56:00-02:56:03*

I mean, these are the kind of things you-- there's some immutable things here, like laws of spiritual-- spiritual laws at work, right?
*02:56:04-02:56:10*

And you're saying, I don't care.
*02:56:11-02:56:12*

I don't need it.
*02:56:12-02:56:13*

If you understand what's at stake, that's the conclusion that people like Elder Ephraim, or St. Paisios, or Elder Parthenios and Monathos, and all these fathers who were saying, "No, it's an error, and people need to be baptized." Okay, that's their line, the Athonite line, the saints of our day.
*02:56:16-02:56:35*

And so they're telling us that our therapeutic program is not being employed here.
*02:56:35-02:56:44*

We have a loss.
*02:56:45-02:56:46*

We have an incomplete.
*02:56:46-02:56:49*

Now, you're trying to tell me to explain the mystery here?
*02:56:51-02:56:54*

I don't have that answer.
*02:56:54-02:56:55*

I'm just trying to be obedient to the saints and the elders.
*02:56:56-02:56:59*

I can't explain the mystery of what's missing.
*02:56:59-02:57:02*

Elder Ephraim apparently did.
*02:57:03-02:57:04*

When he was alive, he would see spiritually what's going on.
*02:57:04-02:57:08*

He saw people's past.
*02:57:08-02:57:10*

He explained many times their whole...
*02:57:10-02:57:13*

he would tell them their own confessions.
*02:57:13-02:57:15*

He would see their angels.
*02:57:16-02:57:16*

He would talk about their past.
*02:57:16-02:57:18*

He was gifted by God as one of the great saints of our day.
*02:57:18-02:57:21*

And he would say to people, "You haven't been baptized." He would see that.
*02:57:22-02:57:25*

God would reveal that.
*02:57:26-02:57:26*

And he would understand what's missing.
*02:57:27-02:57:29*

There would be something missing here.
*02:57:30-02:57:31*

Now, again, don't over-rationalize it, over-think it.
*02:57:31-02:57:35*

You're not gonna figure it out.
*02:57:35-02:57:36*

I'm not gonna figure it out.
*02:57:37-02:57:37*

But it's clear that faithfulness demands we do what the church has commanded us.
*02:57:38-02:57:44*

And if we do, according to these contemporary saints, especially, that we're following.
*02:57:44-02:57:49*

Because if you follow the saints, if you follow the saints, we said at the beginning of our talk tonight, follow the saints.
*02:57:49-02:57:55*

The saints are not so-and-so in the fourth century only.
*02:57:55-02:58:00*

They're mainly today's saints, our Holy Fathers today.
*02:58:00-02:58:04*

You gotta follow the saints of our age to be communicative and obedient to the saints of older days.
*02:58:05-02:58:10*

So they're telling us that this is necessary.
*02:58:11-02:58:14*

Now, I've seen the fruits of that in my own life.
*02:58:15-02:58:19*

I've seen people be baptized in Mount Athos after being chrismated, and the grace and the light that shines within them.
*02:58:19-02:58:25*

And people talk about it.
*02:58:25-02:58:26*

Oh, remember so-and-so, he was filled with light.
*02:58:26-02:58:29*

Now, that's just a personal witness.
*02:58:30-02:58:33*

You can say, well, he's deluded.
*02:58:33-02:58:34*

He doesn't know what he's talking about.
*02:58:34-02:58:35*

Okay, that's fine.
*02:58:35-02:58:36*

They're telling you the confirmation does come, I think, in many cases from God.
*02:58:37-02:58:41*

So that's why we need to do it.
*02:58:42-02:58:44*

Faithfulness is an error, it needs to be corrected, and there are implications for the therapeutic program that our Lord Himself said.
*02:58:44-02:58:53*

I mean, if it's an error and our Lord said you must be baptized, then is there any thought here that we don't need to do that?
*02:58:54-02:59:02*

If it's not an error, and I'm an error, then don't get baptized.
*02:59:02-02:59:06*

If what they're doing today is not an error, and I don't see any saint telling me that it's not.
*02:59:06-02:59:12*

They're all telling me it is.
*02:59:12-02:59:13*

And there are bishops, of course, who say it's not.
*02:59:14-02:59:16*

I understand that.
*02:59:16-02:59:17*

I don't know how much this has even been really seriously discussed on an ecclesiological level.
*02:59:18-02:59:24*

Get down and discuss these things.
*02:59:24-02:59:26*

What's really going on here?
*02:59:26-02:59:28*

It's usually we're just talking past each other, not real sincere engagement.
*02:59:28-02:59:34*

And again, people misunderstand this whole issue many times.
*02:59:35-02:59:38*

Well, they say, well, economy's possible.
*02:59:39-02:59:40*

Of course, economy's possible.
*02:59:41-02:59:42*

Nobody denies economy.
*02:59:42-02:59:43*

Nobody.
*02:59:43-02:59:44*

The saints never deny economy.
*02:59:44-02:59:46*

What they're saying is the three suppositions don't exist for economy.
*02:59:46-02:59:51*

And therefore, when you do it, confession of faith, charismation, you are in error.
*02:59:51-02:59:58*

It's a mistake.
*02:59:59-03:00:00*

It needs to be corrected.
*03:00:00-03:00:01*

Okay.
*03:00:02-03:00:02*

What can I, or we as laity, do about this?
*03:00:06-03:00:11*

In ancient times, the lady would depose corrupted hierarchs, but these days, it just seems like we can do nothing.
*03:00:11-03:00:17*

Obviously, we need to pray.
*03:00:17-03:00:19*

Okay, so David, what we need to do today, of course, is that we ourselves, in our day and age, we have the problem that compounds all this, right?
*03:00:19-03:00:27*

We have the distortions, we have the temptations, we have the machinations, we have the spirit of the age, and all this stuff is undermining the church unity and introducing all this innovation and all the rest.
*03:00:27-03:00:36*

Okay, we can't do much about that, right?
*03:00:37-03:00:38*

I can't change what so-and-so wants to do of his theologian wants to speak.
*03:00:38-03:00:42*

I can't, that's not, God's not gonna expect me to overturn any of that.
*03:00:42-03:00:46*

What, what, what we can do, because there's something in our day that compounds the problem.
*03:00:46-03:00:51*

And that is secularization, worldliness, lack of ascetic life, lack of prayer.
*03:00:51-03:00:57*

So first and foremost, all of us need to repent and become ascetics and become true lovers of Christ in our own life.
*03:00:58-03:01:07*

then God can make use of us in ways that we can't imagine.
*03:01:07-03:01:11*

In terms of the local church, in terms of our friends, the priests, and all the rest.
*03:01:13-03:01:16*

But what we usually do is we remain really soft on ourselves.
*03:01:17-03:01:21*

We don't really hate the sin.
*03:01:21-03:01:22*

We're kind of weak and lazy and all the rest.
*03:01:22-03:01:25*

And then we-- I mean, in the best case scenario, a lot of us are screaming and yelling about ecumenism.
*03:01:25-03:01:30*

And of course, that doesn't change anything.
*03:01:31-03:01:33*

And people say, well, these belligerent anti-ecumenists, which of course, I don't want to be an anti-ecumenist.
*03:01:33-03:01:39*

I'm not interested in anti-anything.
*03:01:40-03:01:41*

I want to be with Christ.
*03:01:41-03:01:42*

I want to be a lover of the truth and lover of the wisdom of the fathers.
*03:01:42-03:01:46*

But of course I'll be anti-lie, I'll be anti-delusion, I'll be anti-heresy, sure.
*03:01:47-03:01:52*

If you want to call me anti-heresy, that's fine.
*03:01:52-03:01:54*

But you know, the focus is not going to be like, we're going to change things ideologically or practically.
*03:01:55-03:02:01*

In those times you're talking about, there was already a spiritual base, right?
*03:02:02-03:02:06*

those laymen that threw, you know, the story goes that they threw some of the signers of the false union in Florence right off the pier or whatever when they arrived in Constantinople. I don't know how accurate that is, but let's just say they did. And, you know, that didn't happen because there were a bunch of fanatics. It happened because there was a whole base and a mindfulness and a consciousness on a large amount among the laity, right? So that has to be the layman and all of us have to become much more sensitive and have pain of heart for the church. So I think that's where you got to begin. That's what I got to be. I have to care enough about my brothers and sisters in and outside the church who are infected by this delusion. I've got to care enough to have pain of heart and pray for them. I've got to care enough to try to do something like write a book, publish a book, write an article, promote an article, whatever it is, right?
*03:02:06-03:03:03*

That's just an expression of my pain, of heart, of my love for my neighbor, for Christ, for the Church.
*03:03:03-03:03:11*

If we can get to that point where we're that sensitive and we're that much in pain, then God will reveal to us step by step how we might be able to help practically.
*03:03:12-03:03:24*

Don't start with the practical. Don't start with the political.
*03:03:24-03:03:27*

with that second, that's not where you start. You start with repentance, going deeper, and then be able to know the will of God, discern the will of God in your life.
*03:03:27-03:03:38*

Okay. "Hi, Father. In my life, I have had more than one angelic encounter." Okay, is this a question? I'm happy to, I think you've already said this to us in a previous, I'm I'm pretty sure you've already said this in a previous talk.
*03:03:39-03:03:54*

Let me read this.
*03:03:55-03:03:56*

Where my life was saved, also God has told me things and those prophecies have happened just as he has told me.
*03:04:01-03:04:06*

What is the meaning?
*03:04:07-03:04:08*

Father, please pray for me because I am physically and spiritually suffering.
*03:04:09-03:04:12*

Also my ancestor Phileo once told, was told by God to strike a rock and then water comes out.
*03:04:13-03:04:17*

What does this mean?
*03:04:18-03:04:18*

Okay, I don't know.
*03:04:18-03:04:20*

Write me privately and we'll have to discuss this with you.
*03:04:20-03:04:23*

This is totally off topic.
*03:04:23-03:04:24*

Okay?
*03:04:25-03:04:25*

Write me privately and if I can help you, I will be happy to do that.
*03:04:25-03:04:28*

Christ says in the books of Matthew and Mark that whoever marries someone who is divorced commits adultery.
*03:04:30-03:04:37*

So then why does the church allow remarriage after divorce?
*03:04:38-03:04:41*

Now, we're totally off topic, but I'll try to answer that.
*03:04:41-03:04:45*

So those people who have divorced, walked away from marriage, not been faithful and all the rest, what should the church do?
*03:04:54-03:05:06*

How should they pastorally try to help these people be saved, come to repentance, come to knowledge of God, come to chastity?
*03:05:07-03:05:14*

What do you think?
*03:05:15-03:05:16*

Because that's the answer.
*03:05:17-03:05:18*

Whatever the church is doing, it is for their salvation.
*03:05:19-03:05:22*

And so, first of all, we have to make a distinction here.
*03:05:22-03:05:25*

Marriage, the first time, is marriage properly said and properly understood.
*03:05:25-03:05:30*

Second marriage, third marriage, whatever, is not marriage in the same sense.
*03:05:31-03:05:35*

It's not the same service.
*03:05:35-03:05:36*

It's not the same prayers.
*03:05:36-03:05:37*

And so what we have here is essentially an "economia" to keep them from becoming total fornicators. To not go from man to man, and woman to woman.
*03:05:38-03:05:48*

The church is saying, "You didn't make it, it didn't work out.
*03:05:49-03:05:51*

Okay, don't give up, don't despair. Here's what we're gonna do.
*03:05:51-03:05:54*

We're gonna bless you to be together." It's not the same exact, it's not the same thing as the first time. It can't be repeated.
*03:05:55-03:06:00*

That's one mystery. But so you don't, things get even worse.
*03:06:00-03:06:06*

And in this context, live out your repentance.
*03:06:06-03:06:10*

We all have to repent.
*03:06:11-03:06:12*

So it's not like they're any different than the rest of us.
*03:06:12-03:06:14*

It's just a matter of degrees.
*03:06:14-03:06:15*

Okay.
*03:06:16-03:06:16*

And there, and when you walk away from one marriage and, and, and through a variety of reasons, it's always sin that brings about the end of marriage and it's a tragedy, you need to repent.
*03:06:16-03:06:26*

And so the church says, well, this is how we're going to work this or work ourselves out.
*03:06:27-03:06:30*

And we have many, many wonderful examples throughout church history of people who repented deeply and they were made saints.
*03:06:30-03:06:36*

And so we put all our trust and love in God, and we humbly accept that we have failed.
*03:06:37-03:06:42*

And we're failures.
*03:06:42-03:06:43*

I hate to say that.
*03:06:45-03:06:45*

I hope people don't have so much pride.
*03:06:46-03:06:47*

They don't think they can fail.
*03:06:47-03:06:48*

But you failed.
*03:06:48-03:06:49*

I failed.
*03:06:49-03:06:50*

We all failed.
*03:06:50-03:06:50*

But you failed in a very important way, which is in marriage.
*03:06:50-03:06:52*

Okay.
*03:06:53-03:06:53*

What do we do?
*03:06:54-03:06:55*

Let's fall into despair and just be kicked out?
*03:06:55-03:06:58*

No.
*03:06:59-03:06:59*

Of course not.
*03:06:59-03:07:00*

We're going to be embraced.
*03:07:01-03:07:01*

We're going to be encouraged.
*03:07:02-03:07:02*

And we're going to get back on the saddle.
*03:07:03-03:07:04*

And we're going to struggle.
*03:07:05-03:07:06*

All the more so, we're going to struggle before the end comes.
*03:07:06-03:07:10*

We're going to remember our death, and we're going to see our frailty.
*03:07:11-03:07:13*

We're going to trust God and not ourselves.
*03:07:13-03:07:15*

And all of that can happen in the life of the church in this context.
*03:07:15-03:07:20*

So again, I ask you, my brother, Christ said that, and He meant it.
*03:07:21-03:07:25*

And the church says this, and we're dealing with the fallenness of people who didn't make it.
*03:07:26-03:07:30*

What do we do?
*03:07:31-03:07:31*

How do we save it?
*03:07:31-03:07:32*

Obviously, Christ instituted this economy.
*03:07:33-03:07:37*

If you don't believe that, you don't believe Christ.
*03:07:38-03:07:39*

I'm not saying you don't believe it.
*03:07:40-03:07:41*

I'm saying anybody who doesn't believe that, they don't believe Christ is the head of the church.
*03:07:41-03:07:45*

They don't believe Christ is the economizer.
*03:07:45-03:07:47*

Ultimately, He's the one that guides and economizes, right?
*03:07:48-03:07:52*

And works out our salvation, right?
*03:07:53-03:07:54*

And guides us to repentance.
*03:07:54-03:07:55*

So again, it's not exactly the same thing.
*03:07:57-03:08:00*

It's not the same thing.
*03:08:00-03:08:01*

It's a different ceremony, different prayers, and it's meant to help save those souls who didn't make it the first time.
*03:08:01-03:08:09*

It's not marriage in the same sense.
*03:08:10-03:08:12*

Call it marriage, but it's not the same as the first marriage.
*03:08:13-03:08:17*

It's not the mystery that was performed.
*03:08:17-03:08:19*

It's a mystery of God's providence and love for this to be worked out and for their souls to be saved.
*03:08:19-03:08:27*

Okay.
*03:08:27-03:08:27*

God is uniting these people in this new way, but it's not the same as the first marriage.
*03:08:28-03:08:35*

Hopefully that answers it. I'm not really an expert on this, so I'm just trying to tell you the little I know. I haven't sat down and studied patristic texts. There's not a lot, actually, to my knowledge, out there explaining all this, but that's my understanding of the wisdom of the Church on this subject.
*03:08:37-03:08:53*

Maybe I missed the boat on that. So forgive me.
*03:08:57-03:09:01*

"How do I respond to my non-Orthodox family when they ask me if they're going to hell if they're not Orthodox?" Well, you've got to ask questions. That's what you've got to do.
*03:09:02-03:09:15*

The questions have to be thought out, and you have to say, "Well, let's define terms, and let's talk about what salvation is." Salvation is Christ.
*03:09:16-03:09:25*

Where is Christ?
*03:09:27-03:09:27*

How do we commune with Christ?
*03:09:27-03:09:29*

Don't immediately say, "Yeah, you're going to hell." That's really not gonna work.
*03:09:30-03:09:34*

And that's not a good answer, right?
*03:09:34-03:09:37*

You don't know if they're going to hell, first of all.
*03:09:37-03:09:39*

Secondly, but the problem is the whole approach is wrong.
*03:09:39-03:09:42*

Salvation is Christ.
*03:09:44-03:09:45*

Christ, this is His body.
*03:09:45-03:09:47*

In His body, we'll work out our salvation.
*03:09:47-03:09:48*

So it's basically saying, are you, do you believe that you can go to heaven without loving Christ and being with Christ?
*03:09:49-03:09:55*

That's the question I would ask them.
*03:09:55-03:09:56*

What's heaven for you?
*03:09:58-03:09:59*

How do you go to heaven?
*03:09:59-03:10:00*

I mean, this is the thing people need to work out.
*03:10:00-03:10:02*

You need to pastorally, theologically explain to them what it is that you think you're going to go to, if not, it's Christ.
*03:10:03-03:10:11*

And where is Christ?
*03:10:11-03:10:12*

How is Christ?
*03:10:12-03:10:13*

How do we commune with Christ?
*03:10:13-03:10:14*

And then it just kind of works itself out of themselves.
*03:10:14-03:10:17*

If they can get into that mind, understand the economy of salvation, they'll say, "Oh, I see.
*03:10:17-03:10:24*

So by not becoming Orthodox, actually I'm not uniting myself to Christ because that happens in the mysteries." And most Protestants don't even believe in mysteries.
*03:10:24-03:10:35*

So how am I united to Christ in the Protestant world?
*03:10:35-03:10:37*

What does it mean to be saved in the Protestant world?
*03:10:38-03:10:40*

These are the things that need to be discussed with people.
*03:10:40-03:10:42*

Try to begin positively discussing the meaning of terms so that they can probably understand what's at stake.
*03:10:43-03:10:50*

"What was considered a valid marriage before Christ established His church?
*03:10:52-03:10:56*

Were there ceremonies that took place in the temple before Christ?
*03:10:57-03:11:00*

Do secular marriages count?" Yes, there were.
*03:11:00-03:11:03*

And again, you're asking probably someone who's not that well-versed in the whole history of the marriage ceremony, so I don't know the answer about the secular marriages.
*03:11:04-03:11:12*

Do they count?
*03:11:12-03:11:13*

Well, what does it mean to be married in the secular world?
*03:11:14-03:11:18*

That's the question you've got to answer.
*03:11:18-03:11:20*

Does it mean the same thing as in the Orthodox world?
*03:11:20-03:11:22*

No.
*03:11:23-03:11:23*

We believe in marriage is three people.
*03:11:24-03:11:27*

What does it mean?
*03:11:28-03:11:29*

Two people, man and woman, in Christ, the third person.
*03:11:30-03:11:33*

Can that happen outside of the church?
*03:11:34-03:11:35*

No.
*03:11:35-03:11:35*

Secular marriages are not marriages in the Orthodox sense, right?
*03:11:36-03:11:39*

Obviously.
*03:11:40-03:11:40*

So, just like in terms of baptism, we have the "tipos" of circumcision, and that passes away, but still it pointed to that mystery, and it was an identity, and it was an initiation.
*03:11:42-03:11:59*

But now you have baptism, which fulfills it.
*03:11:59-03:12:02*

In a similar way, before Christ came, before the initiation of grace and all the life of grace in the church, you had the life in the people of God and you had the blessings coming from God on the marriage couple and all the rest.
*03:12:03-03:12:20*

It was kind of basically the pro tiposi, right?
*03:12:20-03:12:24*

The pre-figuration maybe of the fulfillment in the church.
*03:12:24-03:12:29*

It was what God's economy allowed for, for that time.
*03:12:31-03:12:34*

Was Peter's first church in Peter's cave church near Antioch before Rome?
*03:12:36-03:12:42*

I don't know what you're talking about in terms of Peter's cave church, so forgive me.
*03:12:43-03:12:47*

I'm not an orthodox encyclopedia here.
*03:12:49-03:12:54*

There's things that-- so I don't know what you're referring to.
*03:12:54-03:12:57*

There was, of course, Peter was the head of the church in Antioch, and he was the apostle sent there, and he established it, taught and preached in all the West before he went to Rome.
*03:12:58-03:13:09*

And my guess is that probably the first or one of the first churches established were in Antioch.
*03:13:09-03:13:14*

But beyond that, I'm not really sure how to answer you.
*03:13:15-03:13:18*

I know people who are Orthodox get a highly ecumenist with Orientals, with the so-called oriental orthodox, the non-Chalcedonian, the whatever you want, many names now we have to describe.
*03:13:18-03:13:33*

What is the best way to equip myself against their ecumenist talking points?
*03:13:33-03:13:37*

There's not a lot to read, unfortunately, in English.
*03:13:39-03:13:41*

There's a lot of work to be done in translation.
*03:13:42-03:13:44*

There's a lot of material in Greek.
*03:13:44-03:13:46*

And so I really don't know what to tell you in English.
*03:13:47-03:13:49*

There's a few things out there that you just need to read and get well-versed in what's at stake.
*03:13:49-03:13:56*

But I'll tell you that I know several people who converted to Orthodoxy from the Copts.
*03:13:56-03:14:04*

One is in Cairo.
*03:14:05-03:14:05*

One is in Athens.
*03:14:06-03:14:07*

Another one was in Cairo and left.
*03:14:07-03:14:09*

And they tell me, first, from their perspective, as those who grew up in speaking Arabic and going to the Coptic liturgy, that much of the experience of the lay people, in any case, has been thoroughly Westernized and particularly Protestantized.
*03:14:09-03:14:29*

And that was very shocking to me when I learned that for a lot of the Christians in Egypt.
*03:14:29-03:14:33*

Apparently, there's a lot of piety that's been imported from the West.
*03:14:34-03:14:39*

And it's kind of strange.
*03:14:41-03:14:43*

And he said that was the biggest difference for me, embracing the Orthodox ethos and then the patristic teachings.
*03:14:43-03:14:49*

Now, I'm not saying that's the case everywhere among the cops.
*03:14:50-03:14:53*

I'm just telling you what people told me.
*03:14:53-03:14:54*

So I'm sure there are people out there who say, well, Father Peter doesn't have experience.
*03:14:54-03:14:58*

You're right.
*03:14:59-03:14:59*

I don't have experience.
*03:14:59-03:15:00*

I'm just telling you what I know from my limited experience.
*03:15:00-03:15:03*

But that was what they told me.
*03:15:04-03:15:05*

And of course, the patristic teaching on theosis was unknown to them.
*03:15:06-03:15:10*

And I think that's extremely instructive for us.
*03:15:11-03:15:14*

For us as Orthodox, that's the core and the heart of the Orthodox church, theologically, spiritually, everything.
*03:15:14-03:15:19*

So the minute we see something so basic missing in the life of the people, then that's for us, for me, it's a confirmation that we have the effects of heresy, the monophysite vision.
*03:15:20-03:15:32*

Apparently many have and are trying to reject that in a certain degree.
*03:15:33-03:15:39*

I think there's a lot of lay people out there who think that that's never been believed among the cops.
*03:15:39-03:15:43*

I don't believe that that's correct.
*03:15:43-03:15:44*

I think there are people who are consciously trying to steer away from that among the Copts.
*03:15:45-03:15:51*

I mean, Matthew the Poor and others were known to be very friendly to Orthodox theology and to talk about theosis.
*03:15:51-03:15:58*

But for the most part, the leadership, I don't think, really ever-- I don't know, ever, but was not speaking about it.
*03:15:58-03:16:07*

And there are many who never heard about it and don't understand it.
*03:16:07-03:16:10*

They don't have the Hesychastic tradition.
*03:16:11-03:16:12*

They don't have the Philokalia.
*03:16:13-03:16:13*

They don't have all this, the athonite spirituality.
*03:16:13-03:16:18*

and all the rest.
*03:16:18-03:16:18*

So, you know, I know for a lot of people, it looks the same kind of, you know, ancient Eastern, you know, liturgically, very interesting, all the rest.
*03:16:19-03:16:29*

But you have to remember that it's not on that level.
*03:16:30-03:16:34*

The problem is not on that level.
*03:16:34-03:16:35*

And that's a pretty superficial way to approach it.
*03:16:37-03:16:40*

And if you would did that, if you approach that way in the third and fourth and fifth century, then you would be accepting the Aryans and the Macedonians and the Nestorians and all the rest, because it was common.
*03:16:40-03:16:54*

Like the liturgical life, everything else was common except the teaching.
*03:16:54-03:16:58*

So let's not be carried away with externals and think that that's all that matters.
*03:17:03-03:17:08*

And that's not the problem.
*03:17:08-03:17:10*

The problem is deep.
*03:17:10-03:17:11*

when you have a departure from the truth of the revelation of the gospel, it affects everything eventually.
*03:17:12-03:17:18*

The dogma and ethos are inseparable.
*03:17:18-03:17:20*

And so there's going to be, over time, grave impact.
*03:17:21-03:17:26*

And anyway, now, having said that, there's a variety of experiences and a variety of backgrounds.
*03:17:28-03:17:34*

And of course, the non-Chestedonian, the Chestedonians are four or five groups, and they have different histories and different pieties.
*03:17:34-03:17:40*

So you cannot speak very generally when you're speaking about the non-Antichrist monotheistic group.
*03:17:40-03:17:50*

You cannot.
*03:17:50-03:17:50*

And there's inevitably going to be somebody who say, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about, because in my experience, this is the way it is.
*03:17:51-03:17:57*

So in terms of what's going on over there now, and we have very limited knowledge in the English speaking world.
*03:17:58-03:18:03*

We don't know Arabic.
*03:18:04-03:18:05*

We don't know a lot about what's going on in the Middle East.
*03:18:05-03:18:10*

And we just kind of assume, and we believe easily, I find.
*03:18:10-03:18:15*

But in any case, learn church history, learn the councils, learn the teaching of the ecumenical councils.
*03:18:16-03:18:24*

Learn what St. John Damascus and others have said that have spoken on this topic.
*03:18:26-03:18:30*

If you want to understand properly the Orthodox understanding of the Fourth Ecumenical Council and all the history that's involved there.
*03:18:30-03:18:38*

I mean, one basic talking point is, "Oh, we're all the same.
*03:18:43-03:18:46*

We're all Orthodox.
*03:18:46-03:18:47*

We're already united." But in the Orthodox Church, a committee of the best theologians is still a committee.
*03:18:47-03:18:53*

It's not the church.
*03:18:54-03:18:55*

It doesn't speak for the church.
*03:18:55-03:18:56*

So the fact that they had all these meetings and people in the committee seemed to come to an agreement doesn't really matter, because the church is not the committee.
*03:18:56-03:19:04*

It has to go to the local churches.
*03:19:04-03:19:06*

It has to go to the council eventually.
*03:19:06-03:19:07*

I would assume.
*03:19:07-03:19:09*

And there's a lot of people who are saying that these decisions did not solve the problems.
*03:19:09-03:19:15*

And there are still major problems.
*03:19:16-03:19:17*

Like they don't accept the ecumenical councils formally.
*03:19:17-03:19:20*

They don't accept the saints that we said.
*03:19:20-03:19:22*

We have an advertise the saints that they embrace.
*03:19:22-03:19:26*

You know, there's a lot of historical and theological and basic problems that exist that have not been solved.
*03:19:27-03:19:33*

And then again, there's aspects of the spirituality point to a departure, a grave departure.
*03:19:33-03:19:39*

So, "Father Stephen Rose was chrismated into the church, but everyone that he received as a priest-monk in the church was through baptism." Where?
*03:19:39-03:19:48*

They vowed baptism, of course.
*03:19:49-03:19:50*

They vowed baptism.
*03:19:50-03:19:52*

Why wouldn't they?
*03:19:52-03:19:52*

That doesn't affect the baptism.
*03:19:54-03:19:56*

The baptism is not performed on the strength of his proper or improper reception.
*03:19:56-03:20:02*

It's performed on the basis of the church.
*03:20:02-03:20:05*

And Christ is the one who is given and gives in the mysteries.
*03:20:05-03:20:08*

And he and every priest is performing a function for Christ and for the church.
*03:20:08-03:20:14*

And so, and the error of receiving somebody by charismation is, I know that it's kind of unprecedented in many ways, but also there's no, I don't know of any theological explanation by any church father as to what is implied.
*03:20:15-03:20:35*

in terms of the priest mysteries themselves, right?
*03:20:36-03:20:39*

It's, to me, it's, there's no direction.
*03:20:39-03:20:43*

I haven't seen no direction from contemporary, even contemporary saints, maybe I've seen, I've heard a few things secondhand, but I'm not gonna repeat them 'cause I don't know how accurate they are.
*03:20:43-03:20:53*

But for the most part, there's been no development of theologically to say that people who've been received a chrismation are made priests, therefore their priesthood is invalid.
*03:20:53-03:21:02*

I don't know of anybody who teaches that or says that.
*03:21:02-03:21:04*

And I don't know why, frankly, that would be the case.
*03:21:05-03:21:07*

Because again, the priesthood is not dependent upon the virtue or even the-- I mean, here's where we get a little bit dicey.
*03:21:08-03:21:19*

Like, well, OK, but they were not properly received.
*03:21:19-03:21:21*

Doesn't that affect the reception of the mystery of the priesthood?
*03:21:21-03:21:24*

And again, I don't have any reason to say it does.
*03:21:25-03:21:27*

And I don't have any saint or church father that says it does.
*03:21:27-03:21:30*

So I'm happy to be corrected, but that's where we're at.
*03:21:31-03:21:34*

So as far as I'm concerned, that's where we're at.
*03:21:35-03:21:37*

Until I'm corrected.
*03:21:37-03:21:38*

And of course the church is going to have to speak about it.
*03:21:40-03:21:42*

Church is going to teach about it.
*03:21:43-03:21:44*

And it's not in my hands anyway.
*03:21:44-03:21:46*

But I don't have any reason to doubt.
*03:21:46-03:21:48*

Is there a particular prayer we can do for a real counsel?
*03:21:48-03:21:51*

Kirei lehishon.
*03:21:54-03:21:55*

I don't know of any particular prayer written, Oh Lord, bring about a counsel.
*03:21:58-03:22:02*

But I don't even know if there's any...
*03:22:02-03:22:07*

Is there a particular prayer like to overcome heresy?
*03:22:07-03:22:10*

I guess that would be the prayer.
*03:22:10-03:22:11*

Because the council's role is to give peace to the church and to set the...
*03:22:12-03:22:19*

And preach and teach what has always been preached and taught, right?
*03:22:19-03:22:23*

Which is the one faith delivered.
*03:22:23-03:22:25*

But reestablish that, clarify, and those who don't repent of their innovations and heresies to be removed from their decisions of authority and all the rest.
*03:22:25-03:22:34*

That's the role of the council to bring peace to the church again and reestablishment of orthodoxy across the board.
*03:22:34-03:22:40*

So if there's prayers that you know of, I don't know of any, nothing goes to mind, for the over, I'm sure there have been written a few, but for overcoming of heresy, that would probably be the prayer.
*03:22:41-03:22:52*

The Cumanists argue, we all worship the same Jesus, therefore we're all the same.
*03:22:53-03:22:58*

Yes.
*03:23:00-03:23:00*

"I just worship in my way, and you worship in your way." Unless you are saying there is more than one Jesus, how do we reply to that?
*03:23:01-03:23:09*

There is only one Jesus, and He revealed Himself, and His revelation is the truth of the Orthodox faith.
*03:23:11-03:23:19*

That's what we proclaim.
*03:23:20-03:23:21*

And therefore, those who proclaim another Jesus, like the apostle Paul, I think Charles Yanni is the one asking, Charles or Yanni, I don't know where you go by, ask them, "Well, what do you think about the apostle Paul, and when he says that the Judaizers preached another gospel, what do you think about that?
*03:23:22-03:23:44*

Is Paul right?
*03:23:45-03:23:46*

Did they preach another gospel?
*03:23:46-03:23:47*

Because if they preached another gospel, then they preached another Christ.
*03:23:48-03:23:50*

Because the gospel and Christ are one, right?
*03:23:50-03:23:52*

The Gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ.
*03:23:52-03:23:55*

So when he says they preach another Gospel, then we have another Jesus.
*03:23:56-03:24:00*

In other words, we have a false Jesus.
*03:24:01-03:24:02*

In other words, they're not in communion with Christ.
*03:24:02-03:24:04*

This is the grave implication of every heresy and every delusion, is that it takes you away from Jesus Christ.
*03:24:05-03:24:11*

Why are the Church Fathers so adamant and struggle so hard that heresy not creep in and be preached and taught?
*03:24:12-03:24:20*

Because the implications and the consequences are so grave.
*03:24:20-03:24:24*

Truth has to be embraced and taught and lived for us to become united to God and Christ.
*03:24:26-03:24:31*

We can't be in falsehood and delusion, and preach falsehood and delusion, and then be in the communion with the Spirit of truth.
*03:24:32-03:24:38*

Those things don't go together.
*03:24:38-03:24:39*

So therefore, the question for them is, what does it mean they preached another gospel?
*03:24:40-03:24:45*

They were Christians.
*03:24:45-03:24:46*

They were in the churches.
*03:24:47-03:24:48*

They believed in Jesus Christ, in some degree, as Messiah.
*03:24:49-03:24:53*

They were Christians.
*03:24:54-03:24:54*

They weren't outside the church.
*03:24:55-03:24:56*

The Judaizers wanted the Christians, the Gentiles, to keep all the laws and the circumcision and all the rest.
*03:24:56-03:25:02*

Paul says they didn't just make an error.
*03:25:03-03:25:05*

They weren't like some errors that they made, right?
*03:25:05-03:25:09*

They actually taught another gospel.
*03:25:11-03:25:14*

That's what is made by Paul.
*03:25:15-03:25:18*

That's the question you need to ask.
*03:25:18-03:25:20*

So what does that mean?
*03:25:20-03:25:20*

What does that mean?
*03:25:23-03:25:24*

Right?
*03:25:24-03:25:24*

There is a possibility that you do not know Jesus Christ.
*03:25:28-03:25:33*

And that the fact that you worship differently is not just a personal thing, but you've actually not received the revelation of Jesus Christ.
*03:25:34-03:25:42*

And the way we worship is not some happenstance thing that I make up and you make up, but we receive it.
*03:25:43-03:25:48*

So from who did you receive the way you worship?
*03:25:50-03:25:52*

From who did you receive the way you talk about Jesus Christ?
*03:25:53-03:25:57*

Where does it come from?
*03:25:57-03:25:57*

Because if it's not from God, it's not from Jesus Christ, it's not from the fathers, apostles, then maybe you don't know who Jesus Christ is.
*03:25:58-03:26:06*

I mean, you're not his disciples, apparently, if you're not worshiping the way he taught us to worship.
*03:26:06-03:26:10*

So there's only one Jesus, but there There are a lot of people who don't worship Him, but think they do.
*03:26:13-03:26:17*

That's the answer.
*03:26:17-03:26:18*

What can an Orthodox layperson do, if anything, to stem or perhaps hold in abeyance the rising tide of ecumenism?
*03:26:20-03:26:28*

We kind of already answered that.
*03:26:28-03:26:30*

Oh, my gosh.
*03:26:30-03:26:30*

I just realized we're three hours and 31 minutes in.
*03:26:31-03:26:33*

You people are amazing.
*03:26:34-03:26:35*

You're still hanging on.
*03:26:35-03:26:36*

The strength is impressive.
*03:26:39-03:26:40*

So last question.
*03:26:41-03:26:42*

All other questions are gonna be from our Crowdcast folks.
*03:26:42-03:26:46*

We're gonna take them on Thursday, all right?
*03:26:47-03:26:51*

So hang out on those questions, remind me to come back to them on Thursday.
*03:26:52-03:26:54*

Everybody who's not in Crowdcast, not in Patreon, you ought to consider coming over and join us and asking your questions on Thursday.
*03:26:55-03:27:01*

We talk about all kinds of things.
*03:27:01-03:27:03*

Every Thursday night, we are together five to eight, and we're answering your questions again.
*03:27:03-03:27:10*

So last question, again, what can a lay person do to stem the rising tide of ecumenism?
*03:27:10-03:27:16*

I think I've explained that George about 20 minutes ago.
*03:27:16-03:27:20*

Go up a little bit and listen to the question that was asked by, let me see if I can find the words.
*03:27:20-03:27:27*

Where'd it go?
*03:27:31-03:27:32*

David asked that question about 25 minutes ago.
*03:27:37-03:27:41*

And so I've answered that.
*03:27:42-03:27:43*

I don't want to answer it again.
*03:27:43-03:27:43*

Everybody heard that.
*03:27:44-03:27:44*

And there's a lot we can do.
*03:27:45-03:27:46*

We've got to start with ourselves and repent and become worthy of becoming tools in the hands of God.
*03:27:46-03:27:53*

But, you know, there's many practical things, but mainly we have to prepare ourselves through asceticism and acquiring all the virtues, and then through that we can become very effective in helping others.
*03:27:53-03:28:08*

But if we're only going to work on the horizontal plane and, you know, like the Protestants did, they want to change everything.
*03:28:10-03:28:15*

That's not going to really work, but check out that answer.
*03:28:15-03:28:18*

Hopefully that will give you what you're looking for.
*03:28:19-03:28:21*

God bless you.
*03:28:21-03:28:22*

Thank you for your patience.
*03:28:22-03:28:23*

Thank you for joining us tonight.
*03:28:23-03:28:24*

Hopefully this is going to be very beneficial for a lot of people.
*03:28:24-03:28:26*

Pray for us and we'll see you on Thursday for Crowdcast and then on next Tuesday for the next installment of our analysis of the Book of Revelation.
*03:28:27-03:28:38*

And we'll see you then.
*03:28:39-03:28:40*

God bless, and good struggles on the path to Pascha.
*03:28:41-03:28:46*
