# Diptych Removal and Cessation of Commemoration Throughout Orthodox History: Primary Source Documentation

The practice of removing names from liturgical diptychs (commemorative lists) and ceasing commemorative prayers represents one of the most consistent and well-documented methods by which Orthodox Christians have separated from heretical or compromised hierarchs throughout Church history. Extensive primary source evidence demonstrates that this practice, far from being innovation or extremism, constitutes the normative Orthodox response to hierarchical compromise across seventeen centuries.

## Theological Foundation: Commemoration as Communion

Orthodox liturgical theology establishes that commemorating a hierarch's name during divine services creates substantive spiritual communion with that person and their teachings. **The Letter of the Monks of Mt. Athos to Emperor Michael Paleologos** (13th century) provides the clearest theological explanation:

> "For if simply saying 'fare-thee-well [2 Jn. 10]' makes us communicants of another's evil works, how much more is this the case with the official commemoration of one during the celebration of the divine and fearful Mysteries?... The Orthodox Church of God from the very beginning has acknowledged that mentioning a hierarch's name inside the sanctuary means complete communion with him; for it is recorded in the interpretation of the Divine Liturgy that when the celebrant commemorates the bishop's name, he thus demonstrates his submission to a superior, and that he is in communion with him, and a follower of him in the Faith and in the holy Mysteries."¹

This theological principle establishes why cessation of commemoration becomes necessary when hierarchs embrace heretical positions or activities.

## Early Church Precedents: The Acacian Schism (484-519)

### The Henotikon Crisis and Papal Response

The Acacian Schism provides detailed documentation of how commemoration functions as communion and how its cessation constitutes legitimate separation. When Emperor Zeno issued the Henotikon in 482, attempting to reconcile Chalcedonians and Monophysites through compromise, the result demonstrated why doctrinal compromise fails:

"The Henotikon was widely accepted in the East but proved unacceptable to Rome and the Western church. Consequently, Acacius was deposed (484) by Pope Felix III in an excommunication that was reaffirmed and broadened in 485 to embrace all of Acacius's accomplices, including a substantial part of the Byzantine hierarchy."²

### Diptych Removal as Response

**Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople** responded to papal condemnation by implementing the exact practice documented throughout Orthodox history: **"Acacius struck the name of Felix from the diptychs (the book containing the names of those who were mentioned in the liturgical prayers of the Church of Constantinople), and the resulting 'Acacian' schism, as it was called, lasted until 519."**³

This demonstrates that both Eastern and Western church authorities understood diptych removal as the appropriate response to hierarchical compromise, creating formal ecclesiastical separation until doctrinal issues were resolved.

### The Peter the Fuller Example

**Evagrius's Church History** documents how compromised ordinations disqualify hierarchs from Orthodox commemoration, regardless of their personal orthodoxy:

> "The church of the Romans does not admit Peter, the heretic, who has also been long ago condemned by the holy see, excommunicated, and anathematised. To whom, if there were no other objection, this is sufficient, namely, that having been ordained by heretics, he could not have authority over the orthodox."⁴

This establishes the principle that hierarchical authority can be forfeited through heretical associations, making commemoration inappropriate even when the individual might be personally orthodox.

## Byzantine Period: Popular and Hierarchical Resistance

### Severus and Timothy: Popular Refusal of Heretical Commemoration

**Theophanes Chronographia** documents how Orthodox faithful prevented commemoration of heretical hierarchs through popular resistance:

> "Timothy Patriarch of Constantinople, the name of Severus wanting to add to the diptychs and remove the name of Flavian, was prevented by the people. Because every Orthodox avoided communion with Severus."⁵

This demonstrates that cessation of commemoration was not merely a hierarchical decision but reflected the canonical duty of Orthodox faithful to refuse communion with heretics.

### Juvenal of Jerusalem: Diptych Removal Following Heretical Councils

The case of **Juvenal of Jerusalem** illustrates how participation in heretical councils triggered immediate diptych removal:

"Juvenal was one of the leaders of the Second Council of Ephesus in 449, being the first to sign it as an ally of Dioscorus. This led to his name being removed from the diptychs of the churches that rejected the council."⁶

**Pope Leo I** supported this practice, endorsing "removing the names of Dioscorus and Iuvenalis from the diptychs because of their canonical and theological deviations during the second Council of Ephesus."⁷

## Patristic Consensus on Separation from Heretical Hierarchy

### St. Pachomios the Great: Vision of Bishops in Communion with Heretics

**The Life of St. Pachomios the Great (292-348)** contains a remarkable vision revealing the spiritual consequences of hierarchical compromise. In this divine revelation, St. Pachomios saw:

> "Those of the brothers who let go their hold stand for bishops who are in the right Faith of Christ, but are in communion with the heretics and mislead many of those they teach and especially men who have no malice; they neglect those who behave well and give scandal to many, as it is written, 'Woe to him through whom scandal comes.'"⁸

This vision specifically addresses the contemporary situation of bishops who are personally orthodox but maintain communion with heretics, revealing that such compromise "misleads many" and "gives scandal." The vision demonstrates that spiritual darkness results from maintaining communion with heretical authority, even when done by otherwise orthodox hierarchs.

### St. Athanasius: The Duty to Separate from Compromised Bishops

**St. Athanasius** provided comprehensive instruction on avoiding communion with both heretics and those who associate with heretics:

> "Since there are some who hold to the views of Arius and go around the monasteries for no other reason than to come to you and then return from us, in order to deceive the pure-minded, and since there are also some who assert that they do not share the views of Arius, yet they condescend and pray together with them in the same place — I have, at the earnest request of certain most sincere brothers, hastened to write to you, so that, preserving the pious faith which the grace of God is working in you with purity and without deceit, you may give no occasion for scandal to the brethren."⁹

St. Athanasius specifically addresses those who **"assert that they do not share the views of Arius, yet they condescend and pray together with them"** - precisely describing bishops who claim orthodoxy while maintaining communion with heretical patriarchs.

**His instruction continues**:

> "For when some see you, the faithful in Christ, assembling and communing with them, they will surely conclude that such things are indifferent, and they will fall into the mire of impiety. Therefore, in order that this may not happen, be willing, beloved, to turn away from those who openly hold impious beliefs, and to be on guard against those who claim not to hold Arian views but still associate with the impious."¹⁰

**The canonical requirement**: 

> "If someone pretends to confess the right faith but is seen to associate with those people, urge such a one to abstain from that kind of familiarity. And if he agrees, regard him as a brother. But if he stubbornly persists, avoid such a person. For in this way, you will continue to keep the faith pure."¹¹

This establishes the principle that Orthodox faithful must avoid communion with hierarchs who maintain association with heretics, regardless of the hierarchs' personal orthodoxy.

**St. Athanasius on Removing Scandalous Hierarchs**:

> "As we walk the unerring and life-giving path, let us cut off the eye that causes scandal—not the physical eye, but the spiritual one. That is, if the bishop or the presbyter, who are considered the eyes of the Church, behave badly and scandalize the people, they must be cast out. For it is better to gather together in a place of prayer without them than, along with them, to be cast into the Gehenna of fire, as with Annas and Caiaphas."¹²

This directly authorizes separation from compromised hierarchs, declaring it **"better to gather together in a place of prayer without them"** than to risk spiritual destruction through continued communion.

### St. Basil the Great: No Communion with Compromised Orthodox

**St. Basil the Great** established the principle that even personally orthodox individuals forfeit communion rights through association with heretics:

> "As for all those who pretend to confess sound Orthodox Faith, but are in communion with people who hold a different opinion, if they are forewarned and still remain stubborn, you must not only not be in communion with them, but you must not even call them brothers."¹³

This directly applies to contemporary situations where Orthodox hierarchs maintain communion with ecumenically-compromised patriarchs.

### St. John of Damascus: Prohibition of Heretical Communion

**St. John of Damascus** connected refusal of heretical communion to Christ's own teaching:

> "With all our strength let us beware lest we receive Communion from or give it to heretics. 'Give not what is holy to the dogs,' says the Lord. 'Neither cast ye your pearls before swine,' lest we become partakers in their dishonor and condemnation."⁹

### St. Mark of Ephesus: Fleeing Heretical Commemoration

**St. Mark of Ephesus** specifically addressed commemoration of heretical hierarchs:

> "Flee, brethren! Flee communion with the incommunicable and the commemoration of the uncommemorative."¹⁰

This establishes that commemoration itself constitutes communion requiring avoidance when hierarchs embrace heretical positions.

### St. Theodore the Studite: Comprehensive Condemnation

**St. Theodore the Studite** provided multiple statements establishing that communion with heretics disqualifies individuals from Christian fellowship:

> "Even if one should give away all his possessions in the world, and yet be in communion with heresy, he cannot be a friend of God, but is rather an enemy."¹¹

> "[John] Chrysostom loudly declares not only heretics, but also those who have communion with them, to be enemies of God."¹²

> "Guard yourselves from soul-destroying heresy, communion with which is alienation from Christ."¹³

> "Regarding the Faith, the heretics were utterly shipwrecked; but concerning the others, even if in their thinking they did not founder, nevertheless, on account of their communion with heresy, they too were destroyed alongside the others."¹⁴

## Scriptural Foundation for Separation

### Old Testament Precedents

**Psalm 26:4-5** establishes the principle of avoiding communion with those embracing evil:

> "I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked."¹⁵

### New Testament Commands

**2 Corinthians 6:17** provides direct apostolic command for separation from spiritual compromise:

> "Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you."¹⁶

**Isaiah 52:11** reinforces this principle:

> "'Come out from the midst of them, and be separated,' saith the Lord, 'and cease touching the unclean thing,' and I will receive you."¹⁷

## Canonical Responsibility of the Orthodox Faithful

### The Apostolic Constitutions on Lay Responsibility

**The Apostolic Constitutions** establish that Orthodox faithful bear responsibility for avoiding compromised shepherds:

> "[God] will judge between one bishop and another, and between one lay person and another, and between one ruler and another (for these sheep and these rams are not irrational, but rational creatures); lest at any time a lay person should say, 'I am a sheep and not a shepherd, and I am not concerned for myself; let the shepherd look to that, for he alone will be required to give an account for me.' For as that sheep that will not follow its good shepherd is exposed to the wolves, to its destruction; so that which follows a bad shepherd is also exposed to unavoidable death, since his shepherd will devour him. Wherefore care must be had to avoid destructive shepherds."¹⁸

This establishes that laypeople cannot claim innocence when they knowingly follow compromised hierarchs.

## Theological Implications of Continued Commemoration

### The Mt. Athos Analysis of "Economia"

**The Letter of the Monks of Mt. Athos** addresses the common justification that "economia" (pastoral accommodation) permits commemoration of compromised hierarchs:

> "And God indicated exactly this, saying, 'Her priests also have set at nought My law, and profaned My holy things [Ezek. 22:26].' How? Because 'they have not distinguished between the holy and profane,' but have regarded all things as common. Yet, shall we allow this by using 'economia'? But how could such an 'economia,' which defiles divine things and drives away the Holy Spirit, be permitted in accordance with what God has said? It would result in the loss of the adoption [as children of God] of the faithful and sever them from forgiveness of sins. Could there truly be any 'economia' more pernicious than this?"¹⁹

This theological analysis demonstrates that continued commemoration of compromised hierarchs cannot be justified through pastoral accommodation, as it "defiles divine things and drives away the Holy Spirit."

## Historical Pattern and Contemporary Application

### Consistent Orthodox Response

Throughout seventeen centuries, Orthodox Christians have consistently responded to hierarchical compromise through:

1. **Immediate cessation of commemoration** when hierarchs embrace heretical positions
2. **Popular resistance** to imposed heretical commemorations
3. **Formal diptych removal** by orthodox hierarchs refusing communion with compromised colleagues
4. **Theological justification** based on the principle that commemoration creates communion
5. **Scriptural and patristic validation** of separation from heretical or compromised authority

### Contemporary Relevance

This extensive historical documentation provides canonical and theological foundation for contemporary Orthodox Christians facing similar hierarchical compromise. When bishops participate in ecumenical activities that Orthodox tradition condemns as heretical, the consistent Orthodox response throughout history has been cessation of commemoration and separation from liturgical communion.

The principle established by **St. Basil the Great** directly applies: those who maintain communion with heretics, even if personally orthodox, forfeit their right to Orthodox communion. The theological analysis by **the Monks of Mt. Athos** demonstrates that continued commemoration of such hierarchs cannot be justified through pastoral accommodation.

## Conclusion

Primary source evidence from seventeen centuries establishes cessation of commemoration as the normative Orthodox response to hierarchical compromise. This practice represents not innovation or extremism, but faithful application of consistent Orthodox theological and canonical principles. Contemporary Orthodox Christians facing similar situations follow established precedent by ceasing commemoration of hierarchs who embrace heretical activities, regardless of their personal orthodoxy or ecclesiastical rank.

The extensive patristic consensus, scriptural foundation, and historical precedent demonstrate that commemoration constitutes communion, making separation from compromised hierarchs a canonical necessity rather than optional preference. Those who maintain this separation follow the pattern consistently vindicated throughout Orthodox history.
