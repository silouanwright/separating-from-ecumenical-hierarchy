# Orthodox Theology on Heretical Contamination of the Altar and Liturgical Spaces

The traditional Orthodox position on heretical contamination of sacred spaces represents a rigorous theological framework rooted in patristic teaching, canonical legislation, and liturgical practice. While certain specific claims require clarification, the broader Orthodox tradition firmly establishes principles of spiritual defilement through heretical presence and the necessity of preserving liturgical purity.

## The canonical foundation for liturgical contamination

The Orthodox Church's teaching on heretical contamination finds its primary canonical expression not in the 5th Ecumenical Council as commonly supposed, but in the ancient Apostolic Canons and subsequent conciliar legislation. **Canon 45 of the Apostolic Canons** declares: "Let any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended; but if he had permitted them to perform any service as clergymen, let him be deposed." This foundational principle establishes that even prayer with heretics constitutes spiritual contamination requiring ecclesiastical penalty.

The severity of this position intensifies in **Canon 46**, which commands that any cleric who "receives the baptism, or the sacrifice of heretics, be deprived," citing Scripture: "For what agreement is there between Christ and Belial? or what part hath a believer with an infidel?" The canonical tradition views heretical sacraments as spiritually void and contaminating rather than sanctifying. **Canon 65** extends this prohibition to physical spaces, decreeing that any cleric or layman who "enters into a synagogue of Jews, or of heretics, to pray" must be "both deposed and excommunicated."

The Council of Laodicea reinforced these principles, declaring in **Canon 32** that Orthodox Christians "must not accept blessings of heretics, which are misfortunes rather than blessings," and in **Canon 33** that "No one shall join in prayers with heretics or schismatics." The great 12th-century canonists—Zonaras, Balsamon, and Aristenos—unanimously interpreted these canons as establishing that heretics lack valid sacraments and priesthood, with contact constituting spiritual contamination requiring avoidance of "possible contamination" from heretical practices.

## Saint Theodore the Studite and temple sanctification

While specific texts from St. Theodore the Studite on temple cleansing procedures remain elusive in accessible sources, his **Dogmatic Epistle on the Holy Icons (Letter 380)** provides crucial theological grounding. He declares that anyone who "should transfer the Scriptural prohibitions of idols and misapply them to the holy icon of Christ, so as to miscall the Church of Christ a temple of idols, he is a heretic." This establishes the principle that heretical teaching itself defiles the sacred character of Orthodox temples.

The Orthodox tradition maintains practices for church consecration and re-sanctification, including the requirement established by the Seventh Ecumenical Council (787 AD) for consecrating churches with holy relics of martyrs. The liturgical books contain prayers for the "Lesser Sanctification of the Water" and detailed processes for sanctifying Holy Chrism used in consecration ceremonies. While specific historical examples of re-consecration after heretical use are limited in available sources, the theological principle remains clear: heretical presence necessitates liturgical cleansing and re-sanctification.

## The mystical reality of spiritual contamination

Orthodox theology articulates what might be termed the "communicating vessels" principle—that spiritual connection with heretics defiles the faithful through the mystical unity of the Church. **Dr. Constantine Cavarnos** formulates this precisely: "According to the holy Fathers..., a heretical doctrine is a virus, a poison that leads to spiritual infection and results in spiritual death." This understanding views heresy not as mere intellectual error but as spiritual disease that "separates one from God and the Church" and "spreads like a disease through spiritual communion."

**St. Basil the Great**, in his canonical epistles to Amphilochius of Iconium, provides the theological foundation for this doctrine. In **Letter 188, Canon 1**, he explains that heretics are "completely broken off and estranged with respect to the faith itself," and crucially, that "those who separated from the church no longer had the grace of the Holy Spirit upon them, since it could no longer be given when the continuity was broken." He declares emphatically: "As for all those who pretend to confess the sound Orthodox Faith, but are in communion with people who hold a different opinion, if they are forewarned and still remain stubborn, you must not only not be in communion with them, but you must not even call them brothers."

The patristic consensus on this matter is overwhelming. **St. John Chrysostom** instructs: "Do not have any communion with them (heretics)—do not eat with them, do not drink, do not bind friendships with them," and "loudly declares not only heretics, but also those who have communion with them, to be enemies of God." **St. Theodore the Studite** reinforces this, stating: "Even if one should give away all his possessions in the world, and yet be in communion with heresy, he cannot be a friend of God, but is rather an enemy."

## Episcopal commemoration and eucharistic contamination

The Orthodox understanding of episcopal commemoration reveals the profound theological significance of liturgical unity. The antimension—literally meaning "instead of the table"—represents the bishop's sacramental presence and authority. As Orthodox sources explain, it is "the means by which a bishop indicates his permission for priests under his omophorion to celebrate the Divine Liturgy and Holy Mysteries in his absence, being in effect the church's license to conduct divine services." Without the antimension signed by an Orthodox bishop, "the priest and his people cannot function legitimately."

**Canon 15 of the First and Second Council (861 AD)** establishes the hierarchical chain of commemoration: metropolitans commemorate patriarchs, bishops commemorate metropolitans, and priests commemorate their local bishops. **Dr. Lewis Patsavos** explains: "The commemoration of a bishop by a priest in the liturgy is the liturgical expression of their canonical communion. It is at the same time the affirmation of the right granted to the priest by his bishop to exercise priestly authority."

The mystical significance of heterodox commemoration becomes clear in the teaching of **St. Symeon of Thessalonica**, one of Orthodoxy's greatest liturgical theologians. He declares: "There is no place here on the diskos for unbelievers, let alone for the heterodox. 'For what communion does light have with darkness?'" He explains that when a heretic is commemorated at the Proskomedia, "The particle that is placed near the eucharistic Bread, when that becomes the Body of Christ in the course of the Liturgy, the particle too is immediately sanctified. And when it is placed in the Chalice, it is united with the holy Blood." This creates "a spiritual communion between that person and Christ," making heterodox commemoration a form of spiritual contamination of the Eucharistic offering itself.

## The diptychs as guardians of orthodox unity

The diptychs—liturgical lists of those commemorated during Divine Liturgy—serve as visible manifestations of Orthodox communion. Historically, "Whatever their immediate purpose the liturgical diptychs admitted only the names of persons in communion with the Church; the names of heretics and of excommunicated members were never inserted." This practice reflects the Church's understanding that liturgical commemoration constitutes a declaration of shared faith and spiritual unity.

The contemporary Orthodox Church maintains this practice, with the diptychs preserving "the hope of the resurrection, the unity of the Church, and the power of love" through prayers for both living and departed Orthodox Christians. The exclusion of heretics from the diptychs represents not mere administrative policy but theological necessity—preserving the spiritual integrity of the Eucharistic assembly.

## Conclusion

The traditional Orthodox position on heretical contamination and liturgical purity, while challenging to modern ecumenical sensibilities, represents a coherent theological system grounded in patristic teaching, canonical tradition, and liturgical practice. The Church maintains that heretical presence defiles sacred spaces, that communion with heretics spiritually contaminates the faithful, and that episcopal commemoration in the Eucharist constitutes a mystical union requiring absolute Orthodox fidelity.

This doctrine rests on the fundamental Orthodox understanding of the Church as the mystical Body of Christ, where spiritual unity is not metaphorical but ontologically real. The canons, patristic writings, and liturgical practices all converge on a single principle: the preservation of Orthodox faith requires liturgical separation from heresy, not from hatred but from love—love for truth, love for the faithful, and ultimately love for Christ Himself, who is the Truth. As **St. Paisios the Athonite** taught: "The Holy Fathers were right to forbid relations with heretics... The Truth is not up for negotiation. The Truth is Christ."
