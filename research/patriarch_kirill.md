00:21 - Elder Gabriel on the Ecumenist Patriarch Kirill

Elder Gabriel's cell attendant: "What do you say about Patriarch Kyrill and Putin?"

Elder Gabriel: "If they believe that the Pope is a church and has mysteries and we have to unite, they aren't shepherds but wolves in shepherds clothing.

Whoever, the Patriarch or the archbishop is, who says something that the fathers and the gospel, haven't said
when they say that the Pope is a church and has mysteries and we have to unite... and even if he fasts, if he says this... even if he fasts ...and even if he prophesies... and even if he practices virginity... does signs... does miracles... he's a wolf and not a shepherd... [According to] St Ignatius the God-bearer.

What does the Church say; the 45th Apostolic canon:
'If a bishop, or a presbyter, or a deacon, while assembled with a heretic, jointly prays with heretics, he is excommunicated and deposed."

Cell attendant: "If the Patriarch performs the liturgy and before him is the Cardinal, Papists, isn't this joint prayer?"

Elder Gabriel: "Of course! They (the papists) need to leave the Church or we shouldn't be there, we are jointly praying. We are excommunicated by the (45th) canon."

[at this point in the video, a video is shown, that seems to depict Patriarch Kirill blesses what seems to be Roman Catholics? (3:38)]

Cell attendant translating question from Russian-speaking visitor: "He says, does it comfort you that I'm videoing this and that I will upload it onto the internet?" Does it bother you?

Elder Gabriel: "All right, these things that you re listening to, are they bad? No...

What do the saints say? Saint Gregory Palamas... There are 3 types of atheism. The first type of atheism, the atheist who says God does not exist. The second type of atheism is the heretic. Third type of atheism is when the faith is in danger and I am silent... I don't speak up.

Saint Theodore the Studite says 'It's a Commandment from God to not be silent, do not stay silent when the faith is in danger. We shouldn't be silent.'"

Gregory Decapolite: "Is the assessment of Elder Gabriel true?

Does Patriarch Kirill really believe the Papacy is a Church with grace-filled Mysteries?

His actions speak louder than any words!"

05:03 - Is the assessment of Elder Gabriel true?

[Video depicts future Patriarch Kirill meeting the pope]

(Slow motion of the future Patriarch bowing to and receiving the "blessing" of the heretic)

Gregory Decapolite: "If he doesn't believe the Papacy to be a grace-filled Church, then why is he bowing before and receiving the "blessing" of the Pope?

The grace of the Priesthood does not exist outside of the Orthodox Church!

By receiving this "blessing" he is acknowledging the grace of the Priesthood to reside with heretics, whom he imagines to be a Church!"

[News Reporter]: "As is customary in Russian Tradition, Patriarch Kirill and Pope Francis greeted each other with 3 kisses on the cheek. It is an embrace that has taken nearly 1000 years to occur."

"I am delighted to see you."

"Thanks brother".

[News Reporter]: "Once seated, the Patriarch initiated conversation with the help of translators."

[Pope Francis]: "How was your flight your Holiness"

[Patriarch Kirill]: "Very good, thank God, very good".

They spent a few minutes chatting in front of journalists, and the cameras were able to capture his first words.

"Nevertheless, we have the opportunity to talk heart to heart. That's what I want to do".

"We are brothers, we have the same baptism, we are bishops".

News reporter: "They signed this historic joint statement, 2 hours after their closed door meeting."

05:50 - the Havana declaration of Apostasy

In this apostatic "Havana Declaration", which was signed by the Patriarch and the Pope, we see both heretical nonsense, and the recognition of the Papacy as a true Church (the Pope is spoken of as if he were a true bishop, without any mention of heresy, and his apal organization is identified as being responsible for the spreading of the Gospel - something entrusted by Christ only to members of the One Church).

Below are some key excerpts:

"We are pained by the loss of unity, the outcome of human weakness and of sin, which has occurred despite the priestly prayer of Christ the Saviour: "So that they may all be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I in You ... so that they may be one, as We are one" (Jn 17:21).

Mindful of the permanence of many obstacles, it is our hope that our meeting may contribute to the re-establishment of this unity willed by God, for which Christ prayed."

[Comment: The "loss of unity" was caused by the heresies of the Papacy! And the unity for which Christ prayed is always existent. It doesn't need to be re-established! The Papists fell away from the ever-existing saving unity of the Orthodox Church!]

"Orthodox and Catholics are united not only by the shared Tradition of the Church of the first millennium, but also by the mission to preach the Gospel of Christ in the world today. This mission entails mutual respect for members of the Christian communities and excludes any form of proselytism."

[Comment: heretics have no blessing to preach the Gospel. They actually reject the true Gospel! Also Orthodox Christians have received a commandment from God to "proselytize" (convert) heretics - including the Papists!]

"We are not competitors but brothers, and this concept must guide all our mutual actions as well as those directed to the outside world. We urge Catholics and Orthodox in all countries to learn to live together in peace and love, and to be "in harmony with one another" (Rm 15:5). ... We are called upon to put into practice the precept of the apostle Paul: "Thus I aspire to proclaim the gospel not where Christ has already been named, so that I do not build on another's foundation" (Rom. 15:20)...

Catholics and Orthodox are called to work together fraternally in proclaiming the Good News of salvation, to testify together to the moral dignity and authentic freedom of the person, "so that the world may believe" (Jn 17:21)."

[Note: this declaration of Apostasy received "synodal" praise by the MP "synod" of Nov.-Dec. 2017! Many more comments could be made by us; but the basic point is established - that Elder Gabriel was justified in his assessment!]

What follows is perhaps the best Orthodox commentary on this Apostasy - most of which we agree with!

12:56 - The "perverted social mission" and "New World Order plans" of the so-called "Moscow Patriarchate"

The Fall of the Third Rome: Moscow Capitulates to Papism

By Fr. Emmanuel Hatzidakis

Moscow ... capitulated to the Old Rome, when his Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow embraced the pan- heresy of ecumenism. With a stroke of a pen, he turned his back on one thousand years of Orthodoxy in Russia, following Constantinople (New Rome) down the wide road (Mat 7:13).

The real import of the historic meeting that took place in Havana, Cuba on Feb. 12, 2016 between Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill of Moscow was missed by the media, which focused mostly on the political, social and moral aspects of the meeting. For us, Orthodox Christians, the Joint Statement constitutes a betrayal of the Orthodox Faith.

Please follow their call to action:

"We exhort all Christians and all believers of God to pray fervently to the providential Creator of the world to protect His creation from destruction and not permit a new world war."

It is a call to unity to all, Christians and non-Christians, to pray for peace, as if religious differences among them were of no consequence.

The document repeatedly stresses that we have "inherited" our differences from our ancestors. It sounds apologetic saying, it is not our fault, "we have been divided by wounds caused by old and recent conflicts." Stating that our differences "in the understanding and expression of our faith in God" are due to "human weakness and of sin" is a blasphemy against the martyrs and confessors of our Faith.

It assumes that all the "monotheistic" religions believe in the same God. Before a perceived common danger that threatens mankind, the religious leaders of the two largest Christian bodies appeal to us all to set aside our faith in Jesus Christ our true God, who died and rose from the dead and is worshiped with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and in the one and only Church He founded.

Our theological differences are ignored and are treated as trivialities, as egotistical pretensions before the threat of a world war. Peace seems to be above all-not our faith in the true God. They have both forgotten that the main role of the Church is to spread the gospel of salvation in Jesus Christ.

It seems our religious leaders have come up with a better gospel, that we are "brothers and sisters in Christ," not in virtue of the one and only true baptism we have received in His holy Church, not on account of our great hope of salvation in Christ our Savior, but on account of our "shared spiritual foundations of human co-existence."

Don't be deceived: according to the Declaration it's not our common faith that will save us, nor the proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but our "common values uniting us, based on the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ".

I hope the Jesuit nuance is clear to everyone. It states that salvation comes not from the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but from the human values that unite us.

The Declaration calls martyrs those Christians who have died giving witness to the truth of the Gospel, irrespective of their religious affiliation to "various Churches" (as if Christ founded many Churches). We Orthodox Christians venerate our martyrs, pray to them, we treasure their holy relics and build churches in their honor.

Our Church teaches us to honor only those who have died as martyrs professing the true faith. As for the rest, the Church treats them as pseudomartyrs. It is well known that the Church produced untold martyrs during the great persecutions. "Many even of the heretics in the time of persecution and of idolatry showed fortitude even to death, and were called martyrs by those who shared their beliefs." The Church however directs us not to treat them as true martyrs and not to pray to them...

The ultimate goal of the Joint Statement is the establishment of humanism, placing "fraternal co- existence among the various populations, Churches and religions" as the ultimate goal. This sweeping statement alone should be sufficient for us to utterly reject the entire document.

With deep pain and sadness we admit that the Joint Declaration constitutes one of the most ecumenistic and syncretistic official statements agreed upon by an Orthodox hierarch.

What do the ROCOR bishops and theologians have to say about this capitulation?

[Comment: they seemingly have nothing to say; as they had nothing to say about Kirill singing the praises of, and erecting statues to, that apostate Metropolitan Sergius. Silence, concerning matters of Faith, as mentioned by Elder Gabriel is the 3rd form of atheism!]

--------

The "perverted mission" and "New World Order plans" of the so-called "Moscow Patriarchate":

Patriarch Kirill:

"In my view, the important task of interreligious dialogue and dialogue between bearers of secular humanistic and religious values is to assert the understanding of ***the need to build a multi-polar world***. I use the word 'multi-polar' not in a political but rather a cultural sense meaning a world in which different civilizational poles co-exist in harmony and maintain creative cooperation. The basis for interreligious cooperation in this direction is different externally but essentially it is a common perception by our religious traditions of moral values, absolute and universal...

Laid in the cultural experience of humanity is a great diversity. This given, this basic characteristic of our existence, which in the situation of close, mutually depended and mutually connected life of the peoples becomes an especially important factor in the life of society. It is necessary to find such a modus of interaction of civilizational models that will lead not to confrontation and opposition but to partnership and mutual enrichment — the necessary condition for the prosperity of the whole humanity.

In my view, Russia as a distinctive civilization is a unique example of such ***unity in diversity***."

Along the same lines Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev stated:

"In the meantime we [Orthodox and Catholics] desperately need to address the world with a united voice. Without being one Church, could we not act as one Church? Could we not present ourselves to secular society as a unified body?

I strongly believe that it is possible for the two Churches to speak with one voice; there can be a united Catholic- Orthodox response to the challenges of secularism, liberalism and relativism. Also in the dialogue with Islam, Catholics and Orthodox can act together...

The Roman Catholic Church has dealt with these questions in many documents of the magisterium, the most recent of which being the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, compiled by the Pontifical Commission "Justitia et Pax" and published in 2004.

In the Orthodox tradition the most significant document of this kind is the "Basis of the Social Concept of the Russian Orthodox Church," published in 2000.

Both documents promote the priority of religious values over the interests of secular life. In opposing atheist humanism, they foster instead a ***humanism guided by spiritual values***

By this is meant a humanism "that is up to the standards of God's plan of love in history," an "integral humanism capable of ***creating a new social, economic and political order, founded on the dignity and freedom of every human person, to be brought about in peace, justice and solidarity.***"

Comparison between the two documents reveals striking similarities in the social doctrines of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Churches. If our understanding of social issues is so similar, why can we not join forces in order to defend it?"

[Comment: the Soviet Antichrist taught them this apostatic, chilliastic, nonsense - this seeking to build some bright new paradise! Now they continue this same perverted humanistic mission, having adapted it to the post(?)-Communist state of being. The price they are paying is: the loss of human souls for whom Christ died! We have a commandment to bring the Orthodox Gospel to everyone - including the heretics and those of the so-called "traditional religions".

We have no blessing to set this salvific mission aside, while those called to be successors of the Apostles hold hands with the servants of the coming Antichrist, in order to realize the neo-Soviet mission of the setting up of the idolatrous kingdom of man! Christ came to save us in His Kingdom (which is not of this world!) - not to bring "peace" * "justice", and "harmony" in some new "multi-polar" humanistic world order!

It is, indeed, the Antichrist who will deliver such a kingdom - it is the false Christ who will give these Ecumenists all which they seek!

St. Victor of Glazov, when assessing the early stages of this Apostasy revealed it as "a lawless merging of that which is God's with that which is Caesar's, or rather, that which is Christ's with that which is Antichrist's, which is a dogmatic sin against the Church and is defined as the sin of apostasy" and as "an obvious perversion of the essence of the Church, namely the conscious adaptation of her - the Heavenly Bride of Christ, to serve the world, that is evil, for the world lies in evil." Sadly, this Apostasy has now, not only evolved, but has become a global endeavor!]

17:03 - We were warned! Insights from Elder Athanasios Mitilinaios, Fr. Seraphim Rose, and Archimandrite Constantine Zaitsev of Jordanville

We were warned!

We were warned! Insights from Elder Athanasios Mitilinaios, Fr. Seraphim Rose, and Archimandrite Constantine Zaitsev of Jordanville which expose the type of social, humanistic, and anti-Christian ecumenism which is now embraced by the MP:

Elder Athanasios Mitilinaios:

"Orthodoxy did not come to travel and journey along with the other religions or to coexist peacefully with them, and to learn to get along. It came to dissolve the false faiths once and for all."

Concerning Fr. Seraphim Rose it is written:

That he perceived the emerging "New Christianity" as a kind of "Religion of Humanity", wherein the traditional Christian confession of absolute truth is watered down in order that mankind may be united under the banner of an earthly brotherhood.

Such a religion "takes fundamental Christian values Pull up for precise seeking - peace, brotherhood, unity, love - and distorts them to be used toward the furtherance of purely earthly aims. It does not openly do away with Christianity, it only reinterprets it, so thoroughly that sincere Christians are eventually led to work for the same
goals as secular idealists who are seeking to build their kingdom of heaven on earth [the kingdom of the Antichrist!]."

This religion "has one central doctrine, and that is: 'the welfare of man in this world is the only common and indispensable religious concern of all men'.

To anyone capable of distinguishing between them, such humanitarianism seems indeed a paltry substitute for Christianity; but it is by no means superficial. It appeals to some of the highest human emotions; and its logic - once one grants the initial premise - is 'irrefutable'. It is, in fact, the profoundest and most ingenious substitute for Christianity ever devised [an anti-Christianity]."

And finally, Archimandrite Constantine Zaitsev reveals the following:

"What then is the all-inclusive task for a 'sovietified Christian' consciousness? The setting up of a state of well being on earth, realized simultaneously by both the faithful and atheists. But this is precisely the contemporary task of the communists! In addition, for both these and the others there exists a kind of common 'evil', opposed to both, with which they are jointing struggling. Such is the concise, condensed, exhaustive formula of the spiritual NEP. In its odd originality, it is a transitory stage of the growing apostasy which is already submerging 'historical' Communism into the bygone past.

Let us note that the most advanced religious thought of the West is beginning to understand Communism in such a manner. It is already not content with a tactical acceptance of the principle of 'co-existence', but it is prepared to invest communism with a positive religious purpose..."

[Comment: So the same mission, of the MP leaders, exists now as it did during the times of manifest Communism. This mission is "the setting up of a state of well being on earth" or in Kirill's own words: "the need to build a multi-polar world ... for the prosperity of the whole humanity." This has passed beyond the realm of Orthodoxy, being in fact, not only an evolved form of the Soviet/Sergianist mission, but a manifestation of true Anti-Christianity!]
