Tne Serbian nation and its Orthodox Church have a
long history of more than one thousand years. From the
time when Christianity was introduced through the
missionary work of the great brothers Cyril and Methodios,
the Serbian people have been closely connected with the
Greek Christian civilization of Byzantium and the Eastern
Orthodox Church. The Serbian land is filled with Christian
monuments which bear witness to the particular identity
and character of this nation. Since the first archbishop of
the Serbian Church St. Savva and his father St. Symeon,
both monks and founders of the Hilandar Monastery on
the Holy Mountain of Athos, to this day, the Serbian
people continue to be a source of saints and important
personalities. Among the greatest of these personalities is
the late Father and Professor Justin Popovich (1894-1979).
Father Justin occupies a special place in the pan-Ortho-
dox conscience. Until recently, most of his writings re-
mained unpublished due to the difficult political conditions
in the Balkan lands. Some of his writings, however, have
already been translated into other languages, such as Greek
and French. Eulogies are continuously being composed
from all parts of the Orthodox world, praising his virtue
and his love of the God-man Christ and His Church. Father
Justin is considered a very important Orthodox personality,
one with pan-Orthodox authority. In addition, many
faithful even consider him a saint. Miracles at his grave site
are constantly being attributed to him, such as healings,
flashes of divine light from his tomb, etc. Icons have been
painted and hymns have been composed in his honor.
People entreat him in their prayers to intervene with the
Lord for assistance.
Due to all of these reasons, we have decided to offer the
English-speaking world some of Fr. Justin’s remarkable
writings related to important issues of the day in book
form, such as education, the Church, the philosophical
viiVili ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
trends of our time, the so-called Ecumenical Movement,
and the Patristic Orthodox Tradition.
In this task we have had the assistance of some of Fr.
Justin’s spiritual children and admirers of his thought and
personality. This volume therefore is a collective work and
a common effort, as the blessed father believed and taught,
that in the Church everything is a “communal effort."
The English translation was made from the original
Serbian text and from the Greek version. Among those who
worked with me to produce this volume, and whom I want
to name here and thank wholeheartedly, are the following
friends and co-workers in the vineyard of the Lord. They
are: George Sioras of Brookline, Massachusetts, James
Skedros, a Ph.D candidate at Harvard University, and Fr.
Steven Yankopoulos, a spiritual man and a devoted priest
of the Greek Orthodox Church in America serving the
Muskegon Community, for reading and improving my first
draft of the English translation; the gifted hymnographer
Dr. Haralamambos Boussias of Athens, Greece, for compos-
ing for this edition three beautiful hymns in Greek in honor
of the blessed Fr. Justin; Milan Stoyanovich, a Ph.D. candi-
date at Harvard University, for translating the original
Serbian text of the bibliography from the official periodical
Theology (Bogoslovlje)of the Serbian Theological School in
Belgrade; the venerable and learned professor and Bisho
Athanasios Yevtich of the Serbian Orthodox Church for all
of his assistance and encouragement in this publication;
Mother Maria (Rule) for the translation of the long and
difficult chapter, "The Theory of Knowledge of Saint Isaac
the Syrian," which was published serially in 1984 in the
magazine Sourozh, and my respected teacher and zealous
defender of the Orthodox Tradition, Dr. Constantine
Cavarnos, President of the Institute for Byzantine and
Modern Greek Studies for including this volume in the
publications of the Institute.
Finally, | owe many thanks to some of my spiritual
friends for undertaking part of the financial burden of this
edition.

ixFather Justin Popovich in his study
at the Monastery of the Archangels in Valyevo, Serbia.INTRODUCTION
I. July of 1989, I received a letter from the then
Archimandrite and professor of the Orthodox Theologi-
cal School in Belgrade, Serbia, and now Bishop of
Montenegro, Athanasios Yevtich. In his letter he gave
me his blessing and some suggestions in relation to the
planned volume in English of his Spiritual Father and
teacher of the Orthodox Church, Justin Popovich of
blessed memory.
This letter was a continuation of our conversation in
my home in Boston in the same year when he visited
our city for matters concerning the Serbian Orthodox
Church. In his letter Bishop Athanasios wrote the
following: "As I also told you last May, you have the
blessing to publish a selective volume of the holy
Father, but I ask you not to make it only anti-ecume-
nistic, but rather to include all the dimensions of the
theological, philosophical, and spiritual thought of
Father Justin.”
Together with the letter he also sent me some photo-
graphs and three of Fr. Justin’s works. He recommend-
ed they be included in the planned volume in their
entirety because, according to Bishop Athanasios, they
represent the wealth of Fr. Justin’s personality and
thought and are proof that Fr. Justin is a great contem-
porary father and teacher in the Orthodox Church.
These three works are included in the present volume:
i12 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
They are: The Inward Mission of the Church, Introduction
to the Lives of the Saints, and The Theory of Knowledge of
Saint Isaac the Syrian. In this way, the English-speaking
readers will be able to get to know and appreciate the
thinking of the blessed Father Justin.
For those who know Greek, Father Justin is well-
known because many of his works have been translated
into Greek by his spiritual children and other admirers
of his philosophical and theological thinking. Moreover,
Father Justin himself wrote a few of his works in the
Greek language itself, since he knew the Greek language
well. Additionally, he had even made it possible for
some of his disciples to be sent to Greece and be educat-
ed in the Greek theological schools there. That is why
their writings possess the genuine Orthodox spirituality
and the patristic thought.
Before I say a few words about the writings of this
gifted Father, I will attempt to impart certain informa-
tion about his life. In this way, it will be more possible
to know, understand, and appreciate his theological and
philosophical work.
Father Justin Popovich was born on the day of the
Annunciation in 1894 in Vranye, Serbia. He was named
Blagoye at baptism by his father, Spyridon, and his
mother, Anastasia. He came from a priestly family and
his pious parents raised him in the authentic piety of the
Orthodox Serbian people. He has been, as Bishop >
Amphilohios Radovich says, "the last link of a line that
supplied so many priests during successive generations,
the sanctified fruit of a saintly root: blessed the genera-
tions, blessed the root which gave such fruit as Father
Justin" (Orthodox Life, 1981, cited by Jean-Louis Palierne,
L’'Hommeet Le Dieu-Homme, 10).Introduction ts
From the time he was a child, he was accustomed to
visiting the nearby monastery of the beloved Saint
Prochoros Ptchinyskii of the eleventh century. From
1905-1914 he studied at the Theological School of St.
Savva in Belgrade. There he was blessed to have as his
teacher the famous Bishop of Ochrid, Nicholas Velimiro-
vich, the new Chrysostom of the Serbian Church. In
1916 he dedicated himself to God by becoming a monk.
Soon after, the Patriarch Demetrios of Serbia sent the
young monk Justin to St. Petersburg, Russia, to get an
education in higher theological studies.
In Russia, Fr. Justin became acquainted with the piety
of the Russian people, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the
persecutions which created numerous martyrs of the
Orthodox Church. Then, Fr. Justin left Russia and went
to England to continue his theological studies. From
England he finally went to Greece, where he stayed for
some years in order to learn the Greek language well
and study the Fathers of the Church. In particular, Fr.
Justin devoted himself to the Fathers of the desert, to
the spirituality of the Church, and to the dogmatic and
symbolic monuments of the Orthodox Church which he
continued to study until the end of his life.
In 1926, Fr. Justin submitted his doctoral dissertation
to the Theological School of the University of Athens
under the title: The Problem of Personality and Knowledge
According to Saint Macarios of Egypt. Soon after he began
teaching in the seminaries of Karlovtsi, Prizren, and
Monastir. In 1927 while at the seminary of Karlovtsi, he
published his important study, The Theory of Knowledge
of Saint Isaac the Syrian, which was as mentioned earlier,
is included in the present volume. During this period he
published the religious periodical Christian Life,as well
as the first and second volumes of Dogmatics of the14 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Orthodox Church (1932). In 1935 he was called to teach
Dogmatics at the Theological School of Belgrade. In
1938, together with Serbian scholars, he founded the
Serbian Philosophical Society. With the ascendancy of
Communism in 1945, Fr. Justin was forced to leave the
university and live in various monasteries.
From 1948 he was restricted to the convent of the
Holy Archangels of Chelie in Valyevo outside of Bel-
grade, where he completed his theological work. In this
monastery, Father Justin lived as an Orthodox priest-
monk, offering the Divine Eucharist regularly, praying
continually, fasting, meditating, and being vigilant. The
fact that he left the university at the age of fifty-one was
rather beneficial and productive for his work. Far from
the distractions of the world, he devoted himself to his
writings and left a very rich legacy to the entire Ortho-
dox world.
In the monastery, moreover, his writing and his
spiritual work were carried out in spite of tremendous
pressure from the Communist regime. Due to his
growing popularity and influence on the Orthodox
population, especially towards the end of his life, he
worried the state authorities greatly. He became the
hidden conscience of the Orthodox Church and the
invisible spiritual guide of many devoted Christians
(Ioannis Karmiris, Moral and Religious Encyclopedia, Vol.
10, 548-549). In the monastery he received people daily
for confession, giving guidance to many people, espe-
cially students. This service continued until the end of
his life. He passed away here peacefully, on March 25,
1979 (Old calendar), the day of his birth.
All those Christians, clergy and laity alike, who
benefited spiritually have testified about Fr. Justin’s
genuine love that shone through him during his entireIntroduction 15
life, and about his goodness that, like a magnet, drew
people towards him. His benevolent attitude and work,
though, was not only extended to Christians but to
non-believers as well. They speak of his efficacious
prayer which gave courage to suffering people. Some-
times, even only his appearance was enough to help his
fellow men accept the mystery of the Christian faith and
receive the spiritual ro to continue to face the
struggles of life.
The blessed Father Justin studied the Holy Scriptures
and the lives of the Church Fathers deeply and exten-
sively. He applied their teachings to his daily life.
Through this, he received the necessary weapons to
strike whatever was not true, genuine, and traditionally
Orthodox. His great theological and philosophical
education made him capable of composing important
works in which he attempts and succeeds in comparing
"the philosophy of the world" and "the philosophy of
the Holy Spirit." It is evident in all of his writings that
philosophical thought and dialectic go together with
revealed Truth. His deeply philosophical mind and vast
education enabled him to criticize all philosophies and
reveal their weak points.
This saintly Father is distinguished for his special love
and his undying devotion to the Holy Tradition of the
Orthodox Church. He stood in awe of the great Fathers
and teachers of the Church. He especially loved and
studied the writings of St. John Chrysostom and those
of St. John of Damascus, as well as the writings of St.
Macarios of Egypt, St. Isaac the Syrian, and St. Symeon
the New Theologian. He is a man centered around
Christ, aman anchored in God and in the Fathers of the
Orthodox Church. In all of his writings the Christocen-
tric character of his thought is evident, emphasizing the16 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
importance of the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ and
His Church for the well being of the human personality.
Throughout all of his works, Fr. Justin sought the
independence of contemporary theology from the
influences of scholasticism and the rationalism of the
West. His personal aim was to return contemporary
theology to the sources of the genuine Patristic theology,
which is a struggle of proclaiming and living the faith.
Fr. Justin’s mind and heart were purified by prayer
and worship. He connected the Serbian Orthodox
Church with the great Patristic tradition and enriched
his Church with a great treasure. The Serbian Church
had never before seen such a great spiritual personality;
his works became guides and rules for the life of the
pious man. They are teachings on various topics de-
signed for the young and the old, and the armor of the
people, used for defense against every anti-Orthodox
attack.
This holy Father, through his thousands of pages of
writings, is not simply teaching but chanting a new
hymn, praising the Savior Jesus Christ. He admires the
Orthodox Church deeply, he rejoices in Jesus Christ, and
he expresses his gratitude to Him from the depths of his
being.
The holy Father is a Christian philosopher, dogmatic-
ian, and most importantly a teacher. He is an interpreter
of the Holy Scriptures, a saint, and a prophet because he
lives the tragedy of men yet remains in the light of God.
Therefore, he proclaims the uniqueness of the God-man
and His Church and the deviation of contemporary man
from the Truth.
In order to express his thoughts and feelings, the holy
author coins new words and ways of expression. His
purpose is to express his unshakable faith towards theIntroduction V7,
Savior in order to build the body of the Church and to
protect the revealed truths of the Gospel from heretical
misinterpretations. He considers the latter to be a great
calamity, not only for the Church but for the entire
world.
Father Justin believes that the Orthodox Church
possesses the entire, revealed Truth and the ability to
satisfy all of the needs of man in a greater way than he
could ever imagine or expect. The Christian faith not
only concerns a certain group of people but is the
matter of salvation of all Creation and should therefore
be applied to all forms of life.
The Orthodox faith and its wealth of tradition has at
its center not some abstract moral principles but the true
heartbeat and rhythm of life and the Universe, the
nucleus of all things on Earth, the God-man Jesus Christ,
Who gives its purpose to mankind. Only in this way
does Creation receive its true meaning and can man
follow the correct path to salvation (Orthodox Church and
Ecumenism, Thessaloniki, 5-10). However, Western man,
through his civilization, his education, his sciences, his
society, and his philosophy, has substituted for it the
content and the rhythm of the material world and of life
in general. For this reason the God-man in human life is
in danger of being completely destroyed by His own
creations (Ibid, pg. 11). By expelling Christ from life, His
place has been taken over by de-spiritualized man.
The holy Father connects the God-man Jesus with the
Church, with the Creation, with the evangelical truths
and the evangelical life, and with the Holy Mysteries
and the virtues, and overturns the entire scholastic
theological system. He belongs to the great line of the
defenders of the Orthodox faith against the Western
interpretation of the Christian Truths (Ibid. 11-12).18 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
The blessed Fr. Justin was a wise and renowned
theologian and philosopher, a loud, piercing preacher
of the "saving Truth," a defender of the Holy Tradition,
a confessor in word and in deed, and a great contempo-
rary Father of the Orthodox Church.
The bulk of his work was published in the Serbian
language. In the past two decades, however, some of his
works have begun to appear in other languages (besides
Greek), such as French and English. His works are
markedly original and very vivid in expression, and
have provoked the admiration of many people.
Throughout his long life, first as a seminarian, then as
a monk, a post-graduate student, a priest, an editor of
the Church periodical, a teacher of theology, and a
father confessor, he continued to grow in stature and
reputation. This growing process, moreover, has contin-
ued up to the present day, and will continue for a long
time to come. He became the wise interpreter and the
firm defender of the Tradition of the Orthodox Church
and a living example that has proved that this theology
and Tradition are not dry or dead, but a living force,
capable of speaking to man throughout the ages.
The following are the titles of the most important of
the writings of Father Justin: The Problem of the Person-
ality and KnowledgeAccording to Saint Macarios of Egypt
(c. 1926, in Greek); Dogmatics of the Orthodox Church
(Vols. 1 and 2, 1932-1935; Vols. 3 and 4, published
recently); The Philosophyand Religion of Dostoievsky;The
Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac the Syrian (c. 1927); The
Essence of Orthodox Axiology and Criteriology (c. 1935);
Elementary Theology(c. 1939);Dostoievsky,Europe, and the
Slavic World (c. 1940); The Philosophyof LifeAccording to
St. Savva (c. 1955); ThePhilosophicalAbyss; (c. 1957); The
Lives of St. Savua and St. Symeon (c. 1962); The OrthodoxIntroduction 19
Church and Ecumenism (c. 1974); The Lives of the Saints of
the Orthodox Church (12 Vols.; c.1972-1977); commentar-
ies on the entire New Testament (many volumes); new
translations of many liturgical texts from the original
Greek texts, among them the Liturgies of St. Basil the
Great, St. John Chrysostom, and St. Gregory the Dia-
logue; a devotional prayer book; the small and great
Horologion; akathist hymns to many saints; and Lives of
the Saints (Vol. 13, containing the period of the Triodion
and the Pentekostarion).
Among his countless articles on various subjects, are
the following: "The Spirit of This World," "The Inward
Mission of Our Church," "From the Ancient Aryanism to
the Modern European Aryanism," "The Martyrdom of
the Russian Church and its Saints," "The Gates of
Immortality," "The Gospel of Heaven and Earth," "The
Resurrection of the God-man Christ," "The Planned
‘Great Synod’ of the Orthodox Church," and "The
Planned Oecumenical Synod."
Many of these articles and other works or parts of
them have been translated into Greek and French and
have been published as independent volumes, such as:
Man and God-man (in Greek in 1969, and then in French
in 1982); The Way of the Knowledge of God, Ascetic, and
Gnosiological Chapters (c. 1992); The Orthodox Church and
Ecumenism (c. 1974); Commentary of the Epistle of the
Apostle Paul to the Ephesians (c. 1989); and The Three
Catholic Epistles of St. John (c. 1989).
In the present volume, seven complete works of Fr.
Justin are offered in English as well as selected parts of
his various works, mostly from his commentaries on the
books of the New Testament. The translations were
done from the Greek texts, which were translated from
the original Serbian texts by Fr. Justin’s spiritual sons20 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Bishops Athanasios Yevtich and Amphilohios Radovich,
and others. In addition, a bibliography and a general
index are offered here, as well as some photographs of
the blessed Father Justin which illuminate the text and
familiarize the reader with the author.
I have chosen the title of this volume, Orthodox Faith
and Life in Christ, because these texts of the God-bearing
Father Justin have one purpose, namely, to teach us the
Orthodox faith and guide us in the true Christian life.
This publication is an offering of gratitude and of
recognition of the past and present sacrifices of the
Serbian Orthodox Church for its defense of the Evangeli-
cal Truth against all known and unknown enemies of
the Orthodox Faith. The readers of this volume are
asked to put in their prayers our brothers and sisters in
the Faith. May the Lord shorten the grief and suffering
of the Orthodox Serbian people and their holy Church,
and bestow upon them their much needed unity and
peace.

September, 1994THE INWARD MISSION OF
OUR CHURCH
Bringing About Orthodoxy
I, is very, very difficult indeed for infinite and
eternal life to make its way into the human soul—so
narrow—and into the even narrower human body. Held
behind bars, the inhabitants of this earth suspiciously
stand their ground against anything coming from
without. Cast into this prison of time and space they are
unable—from atavism or perhaps from inertia—to bear
being penetrated by something outlasting time, outlying
space, something which surpasses these, and is eternal.
Such an invasion is considered to be aggression towards
them and they respond with war. A man, given the fact
that he is being corrupted by the "moth" of time, does
not like the intrusion of eternity into his life and is not
easily able to adapt himself to it. He often considers this
intrusion to be sheer unforgivable insolence. At certain
times he might become a hardened rebel against eternity
because in the face of it he perceives his own minute-
ness; at others he even experiences fierce hatred towards
it because he views it through such a human prism, one
that is all-too earthbound, all-too worldly. Plunged
bodily into matter, bound by the force of gravity to time
and space, and having his spirit quite divorced from
eternity, the world-weary man takes no pleasure in
those arduous expeditions towards the eternal, towards
21fg ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
what lies beyond. The chasm existing between time and
eternity is quite unbridgeable for him because he lacks
the strength and ability needed to get across it. Thor-
oughly besieged by death, he covers with scorn all those
who say to him, "Man is immortal; he is eternal."
Immortal in just what respect? In his mortal body? In
what respect eternal? With respect to his feeble spirit?
In order for a person to be immortal he must, at the
very core of his sense of self, feel himself immortal. For
him to be eternal, in his center of consciousness of self
he must know himself eternal. Without doing this, for
him both immortality and eternity alike will be condi-
tions imposed from the outside. And if at one time Man
did have this sense of immortality and awareness of
eternity, he had it so long ago that it has since wasted
away under the weight of death. And waste away it
really has; we learn this from the whole mysterious
makeup of human beings. Our whole problem lies in
how we might rekindle that extinguished feeling, how
we might revive the wasted-away awareness. Human
beings are not in a position to do this; nor, indeed, are
the "transcendental gods" of philosophy. It is something
to be done by God, who incarnated His immortal Self
inside man’s sense of himself and incarnated His eternal
Self within man’s self-awareness. Christ did precisely
this when he was made man and became iS aeen
onetofeel himself really a and know Wisc i
truthtobeeternal. Whereby, for man and for humanity,The Inward Mission of Our Church 23
Christ composes the one and onlypassageand transi-
‘tion from time to eternity: This is why in the Church,
the Orthodox Church, Christ became and remained the
one and only way and the single guide from the former
to the latter, from the sense of. one’s own mortality to
the sense of one’s immortality, from self-awareness of
what is transient to self-awareness of what is eternal
and without dimension.
The ever-living personality of God-human Christ is
precisely the Church. The Church is always personality,
God-human body and spirit. The definition of Church,
her life, her purpose, her spirit, her plan, her ways, all
these are given in the wondrous Person of God-human
Christ. Hence, the mission of the Church is to make
every one of her faithful, organically and in person, one
with the Person of Christ; to turn their sense of self into
a sense of Christ, and their self-knowledge (self-aware-
ness) into Christ-knowledge (Christ-awareness); for their
life to become the life in Christ and for Christ; their
personality to become personality in Christ and for
Christ; that within them might live not they themselves
but Christ in them (Gal. 2: 20). The mission of the
Church is still to bring about in her members the
conviction that the proper state of human personhood is
composed of immortality and eternity and not of the
realm of time and mortality... and the conviction that
man is a wayfarer who is wending his way in the sway
of time and mortality towards immortality and
all
_
eternity.
.is God-human, eternity incarnated within
the b aries of time and space. She is here in this
world but she is not of this world (John 18: 36). She is
in the world in order to raise it on high where she
herself has her origin. The Church is ecumenical,24 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
catholic, God-human, ageless, and it is therefore a
blasphemy—an unpardonable blasphemy against Christ
and against the Holy Ghost—to turn the Church into a
national institution, to narrow her down to petty,
transient, time-bound aspirations and ways of doing
things. Her purpose is beyond nationality, oecumenical,
all-embracing: to unite all men in Christ, all without
exception to nation or race or social strata. "There is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free,
there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in
Christ Jesus." (Gal. 3: 28), because "Christ is all, and in
all." The means and methods of this all-human God-
human union of all in Christ have been provided by the
Church, through the holy sacraments and in her God-
human works (ascetic exertions, virtues). And so it is: in
the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist the ways of Christ
and the means of uniting all people are composed and
defined and integrated. Through this mystery, man is
made organically one with Christ and with all the
faithful. Likewise by ascetically exerting the God-human
virtues: faith, prayer, fasting, love, meekness, thorough
compassion and giving, alms, a man
consolidates
_
himself in this union and preserves himself in its
sanctity, personally experiencing Christ both as the unity
of his own personality and as the essence of his union
with the other members of the body of Christ, the
Church.
The Church is the personhood of the God-human
Christ, aGod-human organism and not a human organi-
zation. The Church is indivisible, as is the person of the
God-human, as is the body of the God-human. For this
reason it is a fundamental error to have the God-human
organism of the Church divided into little national
organizations. In the course of their procession downThe Inward Mission of Our Church 25
through history many local Churches have limited
themselves to nationalism, to national methods and
aspirations, ours being among them. The Church has
adapted herself to the people when it should properly
be just the reverse: the people adapting themselves to
the Church. This mistake has many a time been made
by our Church here. But we very well know that these
were the "tares" of our Church life, tares which the Lord
will not uproot, leaving them rather to grow with the
wheat until the time of harvest (Matth. 13, 29-30). We
also well know (the Lord so taught us) that these tares
have their origin in our primeval enemy and enemy of
Christ: the devil (Matth. 13, 25-28). But we wield this
knowledge in vain if it is not transformed into prayer,
the prayer that in time to come Christ will safeguard us
from becoming the sowers and cultivators of such tares
ourselves.
It is now high time—the twelfth hour—time for our
Church representatives to cease being nothing but the
servants of nationalism and for them to become bishops
and priests of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic
Church. The mission of the Church, given by Christ and
put into practice by the Holy Fathers, is this: that in the
soul of our people be planted and cultivated a sense and
awareness that every member of the Orthodox Church
is a Catholic Person, a person who is for ever and ever,
and is God-human; that each person is Christ’s, and is
therefore a brother to every human being, a ministering
servant to all men and all created things. This is the
Christ-given objective of the Church. Any other is not an
objective of Christ but of the Antichrist. For our local
Church to be the Church of Christ, the Church Catholic,
this objective must be brought about continuously
among our people. And yet what are the means of26 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
accomplishing this God-human objective? Once again,
the means are themselves God-human because a God-
human objective can only be brought about exclusively
by God-human means, never by human ones or by any
others. It is on this point that the Church differs radical-
ly from anything which is human or of this earth.
These means are none other than the God-human
ascetic exertions and virtues. And these can be success-
fully practiced only by God-human, Christ-bearing
ascetics. God-human virtues exist in an organic kinship.
Each has its source in the other and they bring one
another to completion. os
First among the ascetic virtues is the effort of faith:
The souls of our people must pass through, and con-
stantly be passing through, this exertion; meaning that
these souls may then be given up to Christ as having no
reservations and being without compromises; having
extended down to the God-human depths and ascended
to the God-human heights. It is essential to create in our
people the sense that the faith of Christ is a virtue
beyond nationhood, being ecumenical and catholic,
trinitarian; and that for someone to believe in Christ
entails their waiting on Christ, and only on Christ, with
every event of their lives.
The second ascetic virtue is the God-human virtue of
rarer and fasting: This being a virtue which must
ecome the way of life of our Orthodox people, becom-
ing the soul of their souls, because prayer and fasting
are the all-powerful, Christ-given means of purging not
only the human personhood but also society, the people,
and the human race at large, of every defilement. It is
prayer and fasting which are able to cleanse our peo-
ple’s souls from our defilements and sinning (Matth. 17,
19-21; Luke 9, 17-29). The souls of our people must fallThe Inward Mission of Our Church jf
in step with the orthodox life of prayer. Prayer and
fasting are not to be performed merely for the individu-
al, or for one people, but for everyone and everything
(“in all and for all"): for friends and for enemies, for
those who persecute us and those who put us to death,
because that is how Christians are to be distinguished
from the Gentiles (Matth. 5, 4445).
The third God-human virtue is that of love: That love
which knows no bounds, which does not question who
is worthy and who is not, but loves them all; loving
friends and enemies, loving sinners and evildoers,
without however loving their sins and their crimes. It
blesses the accursed, and as the sun does, it shines both
on the evil and the good (Matth. 5: 45-46). This God-
human love must be cultivated in our people because its
catholic character is what sets it apart from other self-
proclaimed and relative loves: from that of the pharisaic
sort, the humanist, the altruistic, the nationalist, and
likewise from animal love. The love of Christ is all-
embracing love, always. By prayer it is acquired because
it is a gift of Christ. Now the Orthodox heart prayswi
intensity: Lord of love, this love of yours for everyone
id for all things—give it tome!
~The fourth ascetic virtue is the God-human virtue of
‘meekness and humility. Only he who is meek at heart
can appease fierce hearts that are in uproar: only he
who is lowly in heart can humble proud and haughty
souls. To be "showing all meekness unto all men" is the
obligation of every truthful Christian (Tit. 3:2). But a
person becomes truly meek and humble when he turns
his heart of hearts into the Lord Jesus, humble and
meek, He being the only truly "meek and lowly in heart"
(Matth. 11:29). The soul of the people must be rendered
meek by Christ's meekness. Every person must learn to28 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE INCHRIST
pray: Meek, gentle Lord, assuage my fierce soul! The
Lord humbled himself with the greatest humility—he
was incarnate and became man. Should you be of
Christ, then humble yourself as a worm: embed your
flesh in the pain of all who are in pain, of everyone
sorrowing and in grief; in the trial of everyone who,
impassioned, is thus tormented; and in the trauma of
every animal and bird. Humble yourself lower than
them all: be all things to all men, but be of Christ and
according to Christ. When you are by yourself, then
Pray: O humble Lord, by your humility, humble ‘mef
~The fifth ascetic virtue is the God-human virtue of
_patience and humility: Which is to say, to endure ill-use,
not to render evil for evil, to forgive iin total compassion
all assault, slander, and hurt. This is what it is to be of
Christ: to feel yourself perpetually crucified to the
world, persecuted by it, violated and spat-upon. The
world will not tolerate Christ-bearing men just as it
would not tolerate Christ. Martyrdom is the state in
which a Christian brings forth fruit. This must be
imparted to our people. For the Orthodox, martyrdom
is purification. Being Christian does not simply mean to
bear suffering cheerfully, but to pardon in compassion
those who cause it, to pray to God for them ¢ asie

imous and meek! Sor
Our Church’s mission is to infuse these God-human
virtues and ascetic exertions into the people’s way of
living; to have their life and soul knit firm with the
Christlike God-human virtues. For therein lies the soul’s
salvation from the world and from all those soul-de-
stroying, death-dealing, and Godless organizations of
the world. In response to the “erudite” atheism andThe Inward Mission of Our Church 29
refined cannibalism of contemporary civilization we
must give place to those Christ-bearing personalities,
who with the meekness of sheep will put down the
roused lust of wolves, and with the harmlessness of
doves will save the soul of the people from cultural and
political putrefication. We must execute ascetic effort in
Christ’s name as response to the cultural exercising
which is performed in the name of the decayed and
disfigured European being, in the name of Atheism,
Civilization, or the Antichrist. Which is why the major
task of our Church is the creation of such Christ-bearing
ascetics. The watchword which should be heard within
the Church today is: Let us return to the Christ-bearing
ascetics and to the Holy Fathers! To resume the exer-
tions and the virtues of the Holy Fathers! To resume the
virtues of St. Anthony, St. Athanasios, St. Basil, and St.
Gregory, of Sts. Sergios and Seraphim of the Russians,
of Sts. Savva, Prochios, and Gabriel of the Serbs, and
others like them because it was these God-human
virtues which brought about St. Anthony, St. Gregory,
and St. Savva. And today only Orthodox ascetic efforts
and virtues can bring about sanctity in every soul, in the
soul of all our people—seeing that the God-human
objective of the Church is unalterable and its means are
likewise so, since Christ is indeed the same, yesterday
and today and unto all ages (Heb. 13: 8). Herein lies the
difference between the world of men and the one in
Christ: the human world is transient and time-bound,
whilst that of Christ is as ever whole, for ever more.
Orthodoxy, as the single vessel and guardian of the
perfect and radiant Person of God-human Christ, is
brought about exclusively by this exertion of virtues by
grace, through entirely God-human Orthodox means,
not through borrowings from Roman Catholicism or30 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Protestantism because the latter are forms of Christianity
after the pattern of the proud European being, and not
of the humble God-human being.
This mission of the Church is facilitated by God
Himself because among our people there exists an
ascetic spirit as created by Orthodoxy through the
centuries. The Orthodox soul of our people leans to-
wards the Holy Fathers and the Orthodox ascetics.
Ascetic exertion, at the personal, family, and parish
level, particularly of prayer and fasting, is the character-
istic of Orthodoxy. Our people is a people of Christ, an
fepuadiese ee oa oes es ie sums up
ee can be driven out of man pe these alone
(Matth. 17:21). In its heart of hearts our people knows
Christ and Orthodoxy, it knows just what it is that
makes an Orthodox person Orthodox. Orthodoxy will
always generate ascetic rebirth. She recognizes no other.
The Ascetics are Orthodoxy’s only missionaries.
Asceticism is her only missionary school. Orthodoxy is
ascetic effort and it is life, and it is thus by effort and by
life that her mission is broadcast and brought about. The
development of asceticism... this ought to be the inward
mission of our Church amongst our people. The parish
must become an ascetic focal point. But this can only be
achieved by an ascetic priest. Prayer and fasting, the
Church-oriented life of The parish, a life of liturgy:
Orthodoxy holds these as the primary ways of effecting ~
rebirth in its people. the parish, the parish community,
must be regenerated and in Christ-like and brotherly
love must minister humbly to Him and to all people,
meek and lowly and in a spirit of sacrifice and self-
denial. And such service must be imbued and nourishedThe Inward Mission of Our Church 31
by prayer and the liturgical life. This much is ground-
work and indispensable. But to this end there exists one
prerequisite: that our Bishops, priests, and our monks
become ascetics themselves. That this might be, then: Let

LIVES OF THE SAINTS
| OF the coming of the Lord Christ into our terres-
trial world, we men really knew only about death and
death knew about us. Everything human was pene-
trated, captured, and conquered by death. Death was
closer to us than we ourselves and more real than we
ourselves, and more powerful, incomparably more
powerful than every man individually and all men
together. Earth was a dreadful prison of death, and we
people were the helpless slaves of death.’ Only with the
God-man Christ "life was manifested"; “eternal life"
appeared to us hopeless mortals, the wretched slaves of
death.” And that "eternal life" we men have "seen with
our eyes and handled with our hands,"? and we
Christians "make manifest eternal life" to all.‘ For living
in union with the Lord Christ, we live eternal, life even
here on earth.” We know from personal experience that
Jesus Christ is the true God and eternal life.* And for

this did He come into the world: to show us the true
God and eternal life in Him.’ Genuine and true love for
man consists of this, only of this: that God sent His
Only-Begotten Son into the world that we might live
through Him (1 John 4: 9) and through Him live eternal
life. Therefore, he who has the Son of God has life; he
who has not the Son of God has not life (1 John 5:
12)—he is completely in death. Life in the one true God
and Lord Jesus Christ is really our only true life because
it is wholly eternal and completely stronger than death.
Can a life which is infected by death and which ends in
death really be called life? Just as honey is not honey
when it is mixed with a poison which gradually turns
all the honey into poison, so a life which ends in death
is not life.
There is no end to the love of the Lord Christ for
man: because for us men to acquire the life eternal
which is in Him, and to live by Him, nothing is required
of us—not learning, nor glory, nor wealth, nor anything
else that one of us does not have, but rather only that
which each of us can have. And that is? Faith in the
Lord Christ. For this reason did He, the Only Friend of
Man, reveal to the human race this wondrous good
tiding: God so loved the world that He gave His Only-
Begotten Son so that whoever believes in Him should
not perish but have everlasting life. He that believes in
the Son has eternal life (John 3: 16-36). As the one true
God giving people what no angel or man can give them,
the Lord Christ alone in the human race had the bold-
ness and right to declare: verily, verily I say unto you:
tof ejonn5.1 1334 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
he that believes in me has eternal life (John 6: 47), and
he has already passed from death unto life (John 5: 24).
Faith in the Lord Christ unites man with the eternal
Lord Who, according to the measure of man’s faith,
pours out in his soul eternal life so that he then feels
and realizes himself to be eternal. And this he feels to a
greater degree inasmuch as he lives according to that
faith which gradually sanctifies his soul, heart, con-
science, his entire being, by the grace-filled Divine
energies. In proportion to the faith of a man the sanctifi-
cation of his nature increases. And the holier the man is,
the stronger and more vivid is his feeling of personal
immortality and the consciousness of his own and
everybody else’s immortality.
Actually, a man’s real life begins with his faith in the
Lord Christ, which commits all his soul, all his heart, all
his strength to the Lord Christ, Who gradually sancti-
fies, transfigures, deifies them. And through that sancti-
fication, transfiguration, and deification the grace-filled
Divine energies, which give him the all-powerful feeling
and consciousness of personal immortality and personal
eternity, are poured out upon him. In reality, our life is
life inasmuch as it is in Christ. And as much as it is in
Christ is shown by its holiness: the holier a life, the
more immortal and more eternal it is.
Opposed to this process is death. What is death?
Death is ripened sin; and ripened sin is separation from
God, in Whom alone is life and the source of life. This
truth is evangelical and Divine: holiness is life, sinful- -
ness is death; piety is life, atheism is death; faith is life,
unbelief is death; God is life, the devil is death. Death is
separation from God, and life is returning to God and
living in God. Faith is indeed the revival of the soul
from lethargy, the resurrection of the soul from theIntroduction to the Lives of the Saints 35
dead: "he was dead, and is alive: (Luke 15: 24). Man
experienced this resurrection of the soul from death for
the first time with the God-man Christ and constantly
experiences it in His holy Church, since all of Him is
found in Her. And He gives Himself to all believers
through the holy mysteries and the holy virtues. Where
He is, there is no longer death: there one has already
passed from death to life. With the Resurrection of
Christ we celebrate the deadening of death, the begin-
ning of a new, eternal life.’
True life on earth indeed begins from the Resurrection
of the Savior, for it does not end in death. Without the
Resurrection of Christ human life is nothing else but a
gradual dying which finally inevitably ends in death.
Real true life is that life which does not end in death.
And such a life became possible on earth only with the
Resurrection of the Lord Christ the God-man. Life is real
life only in God, for it is a holy life and by virtue of this
an immortal life. Just as in sin is death, so in holiness is
immortality. Only with faith in the risen Lord Christ
does man experience the most crucial miracle of his
existence: the passover from death to immortality, from
transitoriness into eternity, from hell to heaven. Only
then does man find himself, his true self, his eternal self:
"for he was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is
found" (Luke 15: 24).
What are Christians? Christians are Christ-bearers,
and by virtue of this bearers and possessors of eternal
life, and this according to the measure of faith and
according to the measure of holiness which is from faith.
The Saints are the most perfect Christians, for they have
‘cf.Paschal Canon,Ode 7 (Translator’s note).36 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
been sanctified to the highest degree with the podvigs of
holy faith in the risen and eternally-living Lord Christ
and no death has power over them. Their life is entirely
from the Lord Christ, and for this reason it is entirely
Christ’s life; and their thought is entirely Christ’s
thought; and their perception is Christ's perception. All
that they have is first Christ’s and then theirs. If the
soul, it is first Christ’s and then theirs: if life, it is first
Christ’s and then theirs. In them is nothing of them-
selves but rather wholly and in everything the Lord
Christ.
Therefore, the Lives of the Saints are nothing else but
the life of the Lord Christ, repeated in every saint to a
greater or lesser degree in this or that form. More
precisely it is the life of the Lord Christ continued
through the Saints, the life of the incarnate God the
Logos, the God-man Jesus Christ who became man. This
was so that as man He could give and transmit to us
His divine life; so that as God by His life he could
sanctify and make immortal and eternal our human life
on earth. "For both he who sanctifieth and they who are
sanctified are all of one" (Heb. 2: 11).
The Lord Christ made this possible and realizable in
the world of man from the time that He became man,
partook of flesh and blood, and thus became a Brother
of man, a Brother according to flesh and blood.’ Having
become man but having remained God, the God-man
led a holy, sinless, Divine-human life on earth, and by
this life, death, and Resurrection, annihilated the devil .
and his dominion of death and by this act gave and
constantly gives His grace-filled energies to those who
‘cf.Heb. 2: 14-17.Introduction to the Lives of the Saints 37
believe in Him, so that they may annihilate the devil
and every death and every temptation.’ That Divine-
human life is found entirely in the Divine-human Body
of Christ—the Church—and is constantly experienced in
the Church as an earthly-heavenly whole, and by
individuals according to the measure of their faith.
The lives of the saints are in fact the life of the God-
man Christ, which is poured out into His followers and
is experienced by them in His Church. For the smallest
part of this life is always directly from Him because He
is life, infinite and boundless and eternal life, which by
His Divine power vanquished all deaths and resurrects
from all deaths. According to the all-true and good
tidings of the All-True One: "I am the resurrection and
the life" Giohn 11: 25). The miraculous Lord who is
completely "resurrection and life” is in His Church in
His whole being as Divine-human reality, and conse-
quently there is no end to the duration of this reality.
His life is continued through all ages; every Christian is
of the same body with Christ,’ and he is a Christian be-
cause he lives the Divine-human life of this Body of
Christ as Its organic cell.
Who is a Christian? A Christian is a man who lives by
Christ and in Christ. The commandment of the Holy
Gospel of God is divine: “live worthily of God" (Col. 1:
10). God, Who became incarnate and Who as the God-
man has in entirety remained in His Church, which lives
eternally by Him. And one lives “worthily of God" when
one lives according to the Gospel of Christ. Therefore,
lof.Heb. 2: 14, 15, 18.
cf. John 14: 6; 1: 4.
*cf.Eph. 3: 6.38 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
this Divine commandment of the Holy Gospel is also
natural: "Live worthily of the Gospel of Christ” (Phillip.
13427): s
Life according to the Gospel, holy life, Divine life, that
is the natural and normal life for Christians. For Chris-
tians, according to their vocation, are holy: That good
tiding and commandment resounds throughout the
whole Gospel of the New Testament.’ To become
completely holy, both in soul and in body, that is our
vocation.” This is not a miracle, but rather the norm, the
rule of faith. The commandment of the Holy Gospel is
clear and most clear: as the Holy One who has called
you is Holy, so be ye holy in all manner of life (1 Peter
1: 15). And that means that according to Christ the Holy
One, Who, having been incarnate and become man,
showed forth in Himself a completely holy life, and as
such commands men: "be ye holy, for I am Holy” (1
Peter 1: 16). He has the right to command this, for
having become man He gives men as Himself, the Holy
One, all the Divine energies which necessary for a holy
and pious life in this world.* Having united themselves
spiritually and by Grace to the Holy One—the Lord
Christ—with the help of faith, Christians themselves
receive from Him the holy energies that they may lead
a holy life.
Living by Christ, the saints can do the works of
Christ, for by Him they become not only powerful but
‘cf.1 Thes. 4: 3,7; Rm. 1:7; T Corl: 2; Ephds=18 22-19) 523;
6: 18; Phillip. 1: 1, 4: 21-22; Col. 1: 2-4, 12, 22, 26; 1Thes. 3: 13, 5: 27;
2 Tim. 1: 9; Phim. 5: 7; Heb. 3: 1

cf. 1 Thes. 5: 22-23.
*cf. 2 Peter 1: 3.Introduction to the Lives of the Saints 39
all-powerful: "I can do all things in Christ Jesus who
strengthens me" (Phillip. 4: 13). And in them is clearly
realized the truth of the All-True One, that those who
believe in Him will do His works and will do greater
things than these: "Verily, verily I say unto you: he that
believeth in me, the works that I do he shall do also and
greater works than these shall he do" (John 14: 12). And
truly: the shadow of the Apostle Peter healed; by a
word St. Mark the Ascetic moved and stopped a moun-
tain... When God became man, then Divine life became
human life, Divine power became human power, Divine
truth became human truth, and Divine righteousness
became human righteousness: everything which is God’s
became man’s.
What are the "Acts of the Holy Apostles"? They are
the acts of Christ which the Holy Apostles do by the
power of Christ, or better still: they do them by Christ
Who is in them and acts through them. And what are
the lives of the Holy Apostles? They are the living of
Christ’s life which in the Church is transmitted to all
faithful followers of Christ and is continued through
them with the help of the holy mysteries and the holy
virtues.
And what are the "Lives of the Saints"? They are
nothing else but a certain kind of continuation of the
"Acts of the Apostles." In them is found the same
Gospel, the same life, the same truth, the same righ-
teousness, the same love, the same faith, the same
eternity, the same “power from on high," the same God
and Lord. For "the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yester-
day and today and for ever" (Heb. 13: 8): the same for
all people of all times, distributing the same gifts and
the same Divine energies to all who believe in Him. This
continuation of all life-creating Divine energies in t40 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
This Holy Tradition i is a eonitued without feRRUAOn as
the life of Grace in all Christians, in whom through the
holy mysteries and the holy virtues, Jesus Christ lives by
His Grace. He is wholly present in His Church, for She
is His fullness: "the fullness of Him who filleth all in
all" (Eph. 1: 23). And the God-man Christ is the all-
perfect fullness of the Godhead: "for in Him dwelleth all
the fullness of the Godhead bodily" (Col. 2: 4). And
Christians must, with the help of the holy mysteries and
the holy virtues, fill themselves with "all the fullness of
God" (Eph. 3: 19).
The Lives of the Saints show forth those persons filled
with Christ God, those Christ-bearing persons, those
holy persons in whom is preserved and through whom
is transmitted the holy tradition of that holy grace-filled
life. It is preserved and transmitted by means of holy
evangelical living. For the lives of the saints are holy
evangelical truths which are translated into our human
life by grace and podvigs (asceticism). There is no
evangelical truth which cannot be transformed into
human life. They were all brought by Christ God for
one purpose: to become our life, our reality, our posses-
sion, our joy. And the saints, all, without exception, live
these Divine truths as the center of their lives and the
essence of their being. For this reason the "Lives" of the
Saints are a proof and a testimony: that our origin is in
heaven; that we are not from this world but from that -
one; that a man is a true man only in God; that on earth
one lives by heaven; that “our conversation is in heaven"
(Phillip. 3: 20); that our task is to make ourselves
heavenly, feeding ourselves with the "heavenly bread"Introduction to the Lives of the Saints 41
which came down to earth.’ And He came down to
feed us with eternal Divine truth, eternal Divine good,
eternal Divine righteousness, eternal Divine love, eternal
Divine life through Holy Communion, through living in
the one true God and Lord Jesus Christ?
In other words, our vocation is to fill ourselves with
the Lord Christ, with His Divine life-creating energies,
to live in Christ and to make ourselves christs. If you set
about this you are already in heaven although you walk
on earth; you are already wholly in God even though
your being has remained within the limits of human
nature. The man who makes himself a christ surpasses
himself, as man, by God, by the God-man, in Whom is
given the perfect image of the true, real whole man in
the image of God; and in Him are also given the all-
vanquishing Divine energies, by the help of which man
raises himself above every sin, above every death, above
every hell; and this he does by the Church and in the
Church, which all the powers of hell cannot overcome,
because in Her is the whole wondrous God-man the
Lord Christ, with all His Divine energies, His truths, His
realities, His perfections, His lives, His eternities.
The Lives of the Saints are holy testimonies of the
miraculous power of our Lord Jesus Christ. In reality
they are the testimonies of the Acts of the Apostles, only
continued throughout the ages. The saints are nothing
other than holy witnesses, like the Holy Apostles who
were the first witnesses—of what?, of the God-man
Jesus Christ: of Him crucified, resurrected, ascended into
heaven and eternally alive; about His all-saving Gospel
lof.John 6: 33, 35, 51.
aaeJohn 6: 50, 51, 53-57.42 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
which is unceasingly written with evangelical holy
deeds from generation to generation, for the Lord
Christ, who is always the same, constantly works
miracles by His Divine power through His holy witness-
es. The Holy Apostles are the first holy witnesses of the
Lord Christ and His Divine-human economy of the
salvation of the world, and their lives are living and
immortal testimonies of the Gospel of the Savior as the
new life, the life of grace, holy, Divine, Divine-human
and therefore always miraculous, miraculous and true
as the Savior’s life itself is miraculous and true.
And who are the Christians? Christians are those
through whom the holy Divine-human life of Christ is
continued from generation to generation until the end of
the world and of time, and they all make up one body,
the Body of Christ—the Church: they are sharers of the
Body of Christ and members of one another.’ The
stream of immortal divine life began to flow and still
flows unceasingly from the Lord Christ, and through
him Christians flow into eternal life. Christians are the
Gospel of Christ continued throughout all the ages of
the race of men. In the Lives of the Saints, everything is
ordinary as in the Holy Gospel, but everything is
extraordinary as in the Holy Gospel—both one and the
other, uniquely true and real. And everything is true
and real by the same Divine-human reality; and the
same holy power—Divine and human—bears witness to
it: Divine in an all-perfect way, and human—also in an
all-perfect way. }

pletely in them, and with them, and among them; and
there is the whole Eternal Divine Truth, and the whole
Eternal Divine Righteousness, and the whole Eternal
Divine Love, and the whole Eternal Divine Life.
What are the Lives of the Saints? Behold, we are in
Paradise, in which everything which is Divine, holy,
immortal, eternal, righteous, true, and evangelical grows
and increases. For by the Cross in every one of the
saints the tree of eternal, Divine, immortal life blos-
somed and brought forth much fruit. And the Cross
leads to heaven; it leads even us after the thief, who for
our encouragement entered Paradise first after the All-
Holy Divine Cross-bearer—the Lord Christ—and
entered with a cross of repentance.
What are the Lives of the Saints? Behold, we are in
eternity: no longer is there time, for in the Saints of God
Eternal Divine Truth, Eternal Divine Righteousness,
Eternal Divine Love, Eternal Divine Life reign and rule.
And in them there is no longer any death, for their
entire being is filled with the resurrecting Divine ener-
gies of the Risen Lord Christ, the Only Vanquisher of
death, of all deaths in all worlds. There is no death in
them—in holy people: their whole being is filled with
the Only Immortal One—the All-Immortal One: the
Lord and God Jesus Christ. Among them—we are on
earth among the only true immortals: they have con-
quered all deaths, all sins, all passions, all demons, all
hells. When we are with them, no death can harm us,
for they are the lightning-rods of death. There is no
thunderbolt with which death can strike us when we are
with them, among them, in them.44. ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Saints are people who live on earth by holy, eternal
Divine truths. That is why the Lives of the Saints are
actually applied dogmatics, for in them all the holy
eternal dogmatic truths are experienced in all their life-
creating and creative energies. In The Lives of the Saints
it is most evidently shown that dogmas are not only
ontological truths in themselves and for themselves, but
that each one of them is a wellspring of eternal life and
a source of holy spirituality.
According to the All-True Gospel of the unique and
irreplaceable Savior and Lord: "My words are spirit and
life" (John 6: 63), for each one of them pours out from
itself saving, sanctifying, grace-filled, life-creating,
transfiguring power. Without the holy truth of the Holy
Trinity we have none of that power from the Holy
Trinity on which we draw by faith and which vivifies
sanctifies, deifies, and saves us. Without the holy truth
about the God-man, there is no salvation for man, for
from it, when it is lived by man, wells forth the saving
power which saves from sin, death, the devil.
And this holy truth about the God-man—do not the
lives of countless saints most evidently and experimen-
tally bear witness to it? For the saints are saints by the
very fact that they constantly live the entire Lord Jesus
as the soul of their soul, as the conscience of their
conscience, as the mind of their mind, as the being of
their being, as the life of their life. And each one of
them together with the Holy Apostle loudly proclaims
the truth: "Yet not I live, but Christ liveth in me" (Gal...
2: 20). Delve into the Lives of the Saints: from all of
them wells forth the grace-filled, life-creating, and
saving power of the Most Holy Theotokos, Who leads
them from podvig to podvig, from virtue to virtue, from
victory over sin to victory over death, from victory overIntroduction to the Lives of the Saints 45
death to victory over the devil, and leads them up into
Spiritual joy, beyond which there is no sadness nor
sighing nor sorrow,’ but rather everything is only" joy
and peace in the Holy Spirit" (Rom. 14: 17), joy and
peace from the victory obtained over all sins, over all
Passions, over all deaths, over all evil spirits.
And all this, without a doubt, is the practical and
living testimony to the holy dogma concerning the Most
Holy Theotokos, truly “more honorable than the Cheru-
bim and beyond compare more glorious than the
Seraphim," the holy dogma which the saints by faith
carry in their hearts and by which they live with zealous
love. Again if you want one, two, or thousands of
irrefutable testimonies of the life-bearing and
life-
_
creating nature of the All-Venerable Cross of the Lord,
and with it an experimental confirmation of the all-
truthfulness of the holy dogma of the saving nature of
the death of the Savior on the Cross, then start out with
faith through the Lives of the Saints. And you will have
to feel and see that to each saint individually, and to all
the saints together, the power of the Cross is the all-
vanquishing weapon with which they conquer all visible
and invisible enemies of their salvation. Furthermore,
you will behold the Cross in all their being: in their
soul, in their heart, in their conscience, in their mind, in
their will, and in their body, and in each one of them
you will find an inexhaustible wellspring of the saving,
all-sanctifying power which unfailingly leads them from
perfection to perfection, and from joy to joy, until finally
it leads them into the eternal Heavenly Kingdom where
there is the unceasing triumph of those who keep
‘cf. Kontakion for the departed faithful (Translator’s note).46 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
festival and the infinite delight of those who behold the
ineffable beauty of the face of the Lord."
But not only these aforementioned dogmas are wit-
nessed by the Lives of the Saints, but all the other holy
dogmas: of the Church, of grace, of the holy mysteries,
of the holy virtues, of man, of sin, of the holy relics, of
the holy icons, of life beyond the grave, and of every-
thing else which makes up the Divine-human economy
of salvation. Yes, the Lives of the Saints are experimen-
tal dogmatics. Yes, the Lives of the Saints are experi-
enced dogmatics, experienced by the holy life of the
holy people of God.
In addition, the Lives of the Saints contain in them-
selves Orthodox ethics in their entirety, Orthodox
morality, in the full radiance of its Divine-human
sublimity and its immortal life-creating nature. In them
is shown and proven in a most convincing manner that
the holy mysteries are the source of the holy virtues;
that the holy virtues are the fruit of the holy mysteries
—they are born of Them, they develop by Their help,
they are nourished by Them, they live by Them, they
are perfected by Them, they become immortal by Them,
they live eternally by Them. All the Divine moral laws
have their source in the holy mysteries and are realized
in the holy virtues. For this reason the Lives of the
Saints are indeed experiential ethics, applied ethics.
Actually, the Lives of the Saints prove irrefutably that
Ethics is nothing other than Applied Dogmatics. The
entire Life of the Saints consists of the holy mysteries .
and the holy virtues,and the holy mysteries and the
‘cf. First Morning prayer of St. Basil the Great and First Post-
Communion Prayer (Translator’s note).Introduction to the Lives of the Saints 47
holy virtues are gifts of the Holy Spirit Who accomplish-
es all in all (1 Cor. 12: 4, 6, 11).
And what else are the Lives of the Saints but the only
Orthodox pedagogical science. For in them in a count-
less number of evangelical ways, which are completely
worked out by the experience of many centuries, it is
shown how the perfect human personality, the com-
pletely ideal man, is built up and fashioned, and how
with the help of the holy mysteries and the holy virtues
in the Church of Christ he grows into "a perfect man,
according to the measure of the stature of the fullness of
Christ."’ And this is indeed the educational ideal of the
Gospel, the only educational ideal worthy of a being
made in the image of God, as man is, and which is
established by the Gospel of the Lord Christ, established
and realized first by the God-man Christ, and after-
wards realized in the Holy Apostles and the other Saints
of God. At the same time, without the God-man Christ,
and outside the God-man Christ, with any other educa-
tional ideal, man forever remains an incomplete being,
a wretched being, a miserable being, who deserves all
the tears of all Ss in codes worlds.

If you are suffering for your faith in Christ, the Lives
of the Saints will console you and encourage you and
make you bold and give you wings, and your torments
will be changed into joy. If you are in any sort of
temptation, the Lives of the Saints will help you over-
come it both now and forever. If you are in danger from
the invisible enemies of salvation, the Lives of the Saints
will arm you with the "whole armor of God," and you
will crush them all now and forever and throughout
your whole life. If you are in the midst of visible
enemies and persecutors of the Church of Christ, the
Lives of the Saints will give you the courage and
strength of a confessor, and you will fearlessly confess
the one true God and Lord in all worlds—Jesus Christ
—and you will boldly stand up for the holy truth of His
Gospel unto death, unto every death, and you will feel
stronger than all deaths, and much more so than all
visible enemies of Christ; and being tortured for Christ
you will shout for joy, feeling with all your being that
your life is in heaven, hidden with Christ in God,
wholly above all deaths.’
In the Lives of the Saints are shown numerous but
always certain ways of salvation, enlightenment, sancti-
fication, transfiguration, "christification," deification; all
the ways are shown by which man conquers sin, every:
sin; conquers passion, every passion; conquers death,
‘cf.Eph. 6: 11, 13.
cf. Col. 3: 3.Introduction to the Lives of the Saints 49
every death; conquers the devil, every devil. There is a
remedy there for every sin: from every passion—heal-
ing, from every death—resurrection, from every devil—
deliverance; from all evils—salvation. There is no
passion, no sin for which the Lives of the Saints do not
show how the passion or sin in question is conquered,
mortified, and uprooted.
In them it is clearly and obviously demonstrated:
There is no spiritual death from which one cannot be
resurrected by the Divine power of the risen and
ascended Lord Christ; there is no torment, there is no
misfortune, there is no misery, there is no suffering
which the Lord will not change either gradually or all at
once into quiet, compunctionate joy because of faith in
Him. And again there are countless soul-stirring exam-
ples of how a sinner becomes a righteous man in the
Lives of the Saints: how a thief, a fornicator, a drunkard,
a sensualist, a murderer, an adulterer becomes a holy
man—there are many, many examples of this in the
Lives of the Saints; how a selfish, egoistical, unbelieving,
atheistic, proud, avaricious, lustful, evil, wicked, de-

malevolent, boastful, vainglorious, unmerciful, glutton-

EDUCATION
4 bee existence of education reveals the fact that man
is an imperfect and incomplete being, as has been
witnessed and continues to be witnessed from the
experience of the human race. All philosophies, all
religions, the sciences, and a myriad of civilizations
testify to this fact. Man is a being who must be
perfected and completed. Therefore, the main purpose
of education is to perfect and to complete man.
Immediately, however, the following inevitable question
arises: With what must man be perfected and with what
must he be made complete?
Observed from every side, man is, according to his
essence, "open" towards other beings and to other
worlds. He is in no way the closed monad of Leibnitz.
With all his being, both his natural and psychic self,
man weaves together, consciously or subconsciously,
willingly or instinctively, the enormous and incompre-
hensible net of life encompassing the whole world.
Education, if it wants to be truly human, must begin
from observable facts, as well as from fundamental
logical principles. The existence in human history of the
search for what is perfect and complete gives birth in
our conscience to the passionate question: Who is a
perfect and complete human being?
5152 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Perhaps Plato? But he, precisely due to his deep
knowledge of his own imperfections and shortcomings,
was transformed into an arrow of thirst for the worlds
above, the worlds of the eternal ideas and ideals. This
means that he is not a perfect and complete man.
Perhaps Buddha is perfect? But Buddha being perse-
cuted by monstrous and pitiless feelings of human
imperfection, transferred all of his desires for the
perfection of the human being to the world beyond—to
a world of apathy and insensibility, that is, to Nirvana.
Therefore, neither is he the perfect and complete man.
Perhaps Moses? Yet even Moses, persecuted by the
horrible calamities of his people and of his own personal
weakness, continued to seek help from heaven. Indeed,
the bitterness of his humanity is sweetened with pro-
phetic visions about the future coming of the Messiah
and the Savior. This means that he also is not a perfect
and complete man.
Perhaps Mohammed? But Mohammed, being tortured
by his bloodthirsty Hades and by his sensual paradise,
runs along this planet realizing through fire and iron his
prophetic dreams, trampling with fanatic enthusiasm on
the corpses of the "infidels." Therefore, neither is he the
perfect and complete man.
Perhaps Kant? But Kant, also tortured with the
imperfection and the incompleteness of the human
being, transferred whatever is human from the narrow
confines of rationalistic decision making and placed it in
the abyss of the meta-rationalistic "Das Ding an Sich,">
leaving himself at the mercy of the unforeseen, of the
unknown, and of the dreadful. Therefore, neither is he
a perfect and complete man.
Perhaps Shakespeare? He, however, in his insatiable
thirst for the perfect and complete, lived a most imper-Humanistic and Theanthropic Education 53
fect and incomplete life of unbearable tragedy. He
guided man to the worlds above, yet left him along the
road amazed and astonished. Consequently, neither is
he a perfect and complete man.
Perhaps Goethe? Living, however, the drama of the
human being in all the breadth and depth in which
Mephistopheles plays the primary role, Goethe, by his
pre-death cry "Licht, mehr Licht" clearly had shown how
unfortunate was his departure from this world to the
world beyond. Therefore, neither was that one a perfect
and complete man.
Perhaps Tolstoy? Yet in his continuous and unyield-
ing struggle with imperfection and incompleteness he
arrived at such a spiritual restlessness that a short while
before his death, in an unbearable agony of the soul, he
escaped from his house, with the purpose of escaping
from his self, from sorrowful imperfection and his
tragically incomplete being. Therefore, neither is he a
perfect and complete man.
Perhaps Nietzsche? But, through the volcanic feeling
of tragic imperfection and of the unbearable incomplete-
ness of the human being in all the dimensions and
realities of this world, as well as through his unbridled
longing for the higher and more perfect man, Nietzsche
became insane! Therefore, neither is Nietzsche a perfect
and complete man.
And so on, from the first to the last man: one sorrow-
ful parade of imperfect and incomplete men. Yet in the
middle of them stands That One who had the fullness
of mystery, the wondrous God-man: in a divine way
perfect and humanly real. His human goodness is
divinely perfect and complete; His human love is
divinely perfect and complete; so is His righteousness,
and His mercy, and His compassion, and His immortali-54 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
ty, and His eternity and His beauty: all are humanly real
but also divinely perfect and complete. Nothing is
miraculous because He has transformed all things
human to divine; He has completed and perfected
everything by the divine. In one word, the whole man
in Him is divinely perfected and divinely completed.
Do you not believe this? Try to imagine a more
perfect God than Christ or a more perfect man than
Him. This you will not be able to do because neither the
individual nor the collective mind of man can imagine
a more perfect God than Christ nor a more perfect man
than Him. More importantly, all the divine perfection
are humanly real and concrete in Christ. There is not
one perfect good or one perfect truth or one perfect
beauty which is not incarnate in His Person or realized
in His life. On account of all of these, He is precisely the
perfect and complete man, the one whom the human
race, the human mind, the human heart, has been
seeking through a myriad of religions and philosophies,
through the sciences, the Arts, and civilization. If we
apply this conclusion to education we would say: Christ
is that ideal man whom human education seeks as its
goal, its meaning, and its ideal. With Him and from
Him we know what constitutes the true man. In Him
we have the type from which each man can build for
himself an ideally good, just, perfect, and complete man.
This is possible without great and insuperable difficul-
ties, because in every labor He gives His divine powers
in order that one may obtain all His goodness.
You feel that we are already on the main path of the
God-human philosophy of education. Pay attention with
seriousness and objectivity to the internal structure of
this education. The plan, the materials, the program, the
soul, and the spirit are all according to the Gospel—theyHumanisticand Theanthropic Education 55
are all God-human. The values are divine and the
methods are centered on the Gospel. God always occu-
pies the first place, man the second. Man lives and
thinks, feels, and works for God. This means that man
is illuminated by God. Here specifically the question is
not about some abstract, super-heavenly God of Plato or
Kant, but about a God of concrete earthly reality,
humanly concrete of a God who became man and
infuses into human categories all that is divine, immor-
tal, and eternal. Therefore, only this one among the
human race, namely, the God-man Christ, had the right
to seek from men divine perfection ("You, therefore,
must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
(Matth. 5: 48)) and to place divine perfection as the goal
of life and as the goal of the whole endeavor of man. By
doing this, He gives to men at the same time all the
necessary means and all the necessary strength with
which to realize this goal of obtaining divine perfection.
What are these means? The holy gospel-oriented
virtues:faithandlove,fastingandprayer,meekness and
hum , compassion and goodness, hopeandpatience,
ith and justice. Applying these virtues produces a
Yon man, namely, a perfect and complete man. Such a
man knows the real meaning of the world and of life,
and he lives with his whole being directed towards
realizing his given purpose in the arena of human
activity. Formed by the holy virtues, such a man draws
unceasingly from the aorta of his existence all the
immortal powers of the everlasting God-man. Thus,
already in this life he feels immortal and eternal; for this
reason, he sees in every man an immortal and eternal
being. The evangelical virtues are the conduits of divine
light; each one instills in man a beam of light. As a
result of this the saint radiates, illuminates, and enlight-56 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
ens. He carries in himself "The light of the world"; this
light illuminates the whole world so that he also might
see its eternal meaning and eternal value. The light of
the world is simultaneously "the light of life." It illumi-
nates the road which leads to immortality and to eternal
life. In our human world light and life are synonymous
as are darkness and death.
The saints of the Orthodox Catholic Church of God
are proof of what has been said above. Education and
training is nothing other than the extension of holiness,
the radiance of holiness. The saint sends forth light, and
on account of this he enlightens and educates. Education
presupposes with all its being holiness. True e ucation
is in fact the saint. Without the saints there are no true
teachers and educators. Nor is there true education
without holiness. Without illumination there is no
enlightenment. Holiness is holiness through divine light.
True education and enlightenment is nothing other than
the radiance of holiness; only the saints are truly illumi-
nated. Holiness lives and breathes by light simulta-
neously shinning and teaching. There is, therefore, an
identity common to holiness and illumination.
Truly, then, education signifies illumination—illumi-
nation through sanctification in the Holy Spirit who is
the vehicle and the creator of holiness and of the light
of knowledge. The saints, because they are sanctified
and illuminated by the Holy Spirit, are also true teach-
ers and educators.
Education without holiness,namely education without’
sanctification bytheHolySpiritandwithouttheperfec-
tionand thecompletion ofmanthroughtheGod-man,
that is,atheistic education,influencedEuropein its
hum nistic idolatry.It isimmaterial whether or notthis
idolatry i ismanifested in thedivinization ofthePopeorHumanistic and TheanthropicEducation oF,
in the divinization of culture, of science, of civilization,
of the arts, of politics, of fashion. Everywhere the main
objective is to organize man, society, and the world
without God, without Christ. This is also true of educa-
tion. There, the main objective is to illuminate man and
humanity without Christ, God. Towards this direction,
humanistic education occupies itself with the creation of
the new man. The plan for this new man is simple:
Christ or anything of Christ cannot exist in the new
man. Europe applied itself to the task and began to
create the new man without God, society without God,
humanity without God.
_
The Renaissance had filled many hearts with hope.
This was natural since European man had essentially
withered on account of the Vatican. Through its illusory
scholastic philosophy and its cannibal Jesuitism in
ethics, the Vatican had drained the creative, vital powers
of European man. Therefore, the renewal of European
man with the humanist spirit of ancient Greece was seen
as essential in order to prevent his impending death. For
this to be realized it was necessary for European man to
be carried away from Christ and to sever his every bond
with the invisible world.
Rousseau took many things from nature and intro-
duced them to man. The following question quickly
arises: What constitutes the nature of man? The senses,
answers the empirical philosophy of Locke and Hume.
The entire nature of man is derived from the senses and
is summarized in the senses. When that which is not
essential for man is subtracted from him, only the senses
remain to define who he is.
The man who is essentially defined by the senses is
very primitive and boorish. For this reason, rationalistic
philosophy under the leadership of Descartes and Kant58 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
proposes a new type of man: man as intellect. Man is
above all a rational being. Everything else in him is
unimportant to the extent that reason is able to claim
primacy in his being.
Yet, the volitionists who are lead by Schopenhauer
and Styerner, protest that the most important element in
man has been omitted. Man’s essence cannot be
summed up in the senses nor in his reason, since he is
neither one of these. Rather, he is foremost comprised of
volition. Indeed, they say, man as volition is the true
man; he is the new man.
Afterwards, Europe was directed towards the search
for the new man among inferior creatures in order to,
based on the animal kingdom, create man without God.
There was great joy and hysterical shouts were heard
when the hypothesis that man originated from the ape
and other mammals was put forward. Nietzsche with
his storms and earthquakes rushed into the world of the
slothful and destructive thought of Europe. With the
passion of a prophet and the ardor of a poet he an-
nounced to the world his gospel about man. More
ardent in his thoughts than in his senses, he extrapolat-
ed from the volitionism of Darwin the bold but logical
conclusion: If the ape is the transitional link to man,
why cannot man be the transitional link to the superhu-
man. Indeed, man is a being who stands between
victory and transgression. "What is the ape to man? He
is an object of laughter and disgraceful shame. The same
must be true for what man is to the superhuman::
laughter and disgraceful shame." The superhuman is the
reasoning of the earth and the purpose of history.
What then comprises the superhuman? He is com-
posed of four elements and principles. First of all is his
need to kill God. "Oh you superhuman," says Zarathus-Humanistic and TheanthropicEducation 59
tra, addressing his disciples. "God was the greatest
danger for you." But do not be afraid. "God died,"
Zarathustra proclaims and there is no danger for you
anymore, there are no more obstacles for the superhu-
man. The second element and principle is that one is not
to have pity on one’s neighbor; whatever happens we
must assist it. Thirdly, and most importantly, is the
irresponsible and merciless desire for power. Finally,
everything is permitted. For the superhuman there is
neither good nor evil; he lives beyond good and evil,
beyond truth and error, beyond conscience and respon-
sibility.
Here ends the drama of humanism: It has created the
new man, the superhuman! From the embryo of
Rousseau, the humanistic man developed into the
superhuman. But what is the essence of the superhu-
man? From what material is he created? From an
instinct only; from the instinct of self-preservation. If,
however, it is not possible for even the smallest insect to
be formed from one and only one instinct, how is it
possible to have the most complex being on earth
formed, that is, man? Here, in the whole animal king-
dom where there are more than six hundred thousand
species, there is not one mosquito or pre-mosquito
which consists of one and only one instinct, even if this
is the instinct of self-preservation. In spite of this,
Nietzsche proclaimed one single instinct for the super-
human. For this his superhuman is in reality a sub-
human, that is, anon-human. If you prefer, the super-
human is the most genius caricature of man found on
this darkened planet.
Whatever is valid for the superhuman is also valid for
all his humanistic ancestors and descendants. Thus, the
natural man of Rousseau is nothing else than a semi-60 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
human because everything that is supernatural has been
taken away from him. This semi-human is identical with
the sub-human, since in him all the abnormal evils
which were nourished and flattered by humanistic
education and training have grown unhindered in him.
As for Locke, man is constituted by his senses. One
part of man has been proclaimed to be the whole man.
Here again we have a sub-human and a new human
monster. What are the senses without the soul but a
five-string violin without the violinist?
Who is the man of reason for Kant? Once again, a
fragment from man is proclaimed as the total man.
Where is the world, the infinite world of the human
senses and feelings, where one finds both our paradise
and hell? Is it possible for man to be a man without
them? No, absolutely not. Therefore the Kantian man is
simply a caricature of man.
As for the man of volition who belongs to Schopen-
hauer and Nietzsche what similarity has he with man?
Where is the soul with its boundlessness, its conscience,
and its compassion? Without all these can man be man?
Oh, this too is a caricature of man, a new caricature!
Observe, therefore, the humanistic exhibition of the
new man: semi-human next to the semi-human, sub-
human next to the sub-human, non-human next to the
non-human—that is, a caricature next to another carica-
ture, insignificant men next to insignificant men. Do you
not see that European humanistic education has created
only shoddy men and with them has populated the:
whole of Europe? A base little man is the natural man
of Rousseau, a shameless man is the man of logic, a
paltry man is also the superhuman. Everywhere you
find an underdeveloped man, fragments and pieces of
man. What you do not find anywhere is a whole andHumanistic and TheanthropicEducation 61
complete man! We find ourselves present at a tragic
exhibition: The European man is without God; he has
degenerated on account of his humanistic education and
has become a base and insignificant man!
We are in need of a new Prophet Jeremiah and of a
new lamentation: The European man has finished his
mission and has created a new man without God and
without a soul. But can this new man, this superhuman
be found? Behold, he does not exist as an individual,
rather he exists as a collective power which devastates
Europe (and not only Europe) through humanistic
education and humanistic culture, through humanistic
art and humanistic civilization. Thus, one particular type
of European man was created, the Holbachian, namely,
V'homme-machine,homo faber, homo technicus (the man-
machine, man-maker, technical man). This man is
without God and without a soul. In other words, he is
a de-divinized and de-spiritualized man-robot. The
robot is precisely a robot because it does not recognize
God and the soul. Do you know what will be of particu-

recognize the soul! Is there anything more paradoxical?
In fact, this paradox happens to be the most inaccessible
palace where her divine majesty lives: the European
humanistic psychology (Psychologieohneseele).This is the
infallible deity that countless robots venerate today.
Here, then, is what was transforming and finally has
transformed Europe into a laboratory of robots from the

planet. May shame and disgrace, eternal shame and
eternal disgrace, be upon Europe for its "new man"—a
man without God and without a soul, the man-robot.
Since he has killed both God and the soul from
within, the European type of man has already gradually
been committing suicide for some decades. Suicide is
the inevitable outcome of murdering God. Education

What athe purpose does education have than to
enlighten man, to illuminate all the abysses and the
precipices in him, and to expel all darkness from him. If,
however, man is without Christ, without God, namely,
without this unique inextinguishable light, how will he
disperse the gloom of the universe which from all sides
attacks him and how will he expel the darkness from
within him? With all his lights, but without God, man
is nothing other than a firefly in the infinite darkness of
the universe. His science and his philosophy, his educa-
tion and culture, his art and civilization, these are but
small candles which he lights in the darkness of earthly
and worldly events. What can all these candles do in the
endless night of the deep darkness of individual, social,
national, and international problems and events? Per-
haps, however, these have already been extinguished

There is only one way to escape final destruction.
What is this way? To accept theanthropic education and
to apply it completely in all schools, from the greatest to
the smallest, and in all state and national educational
institutions. Theanthropic education radiates, illumi-
nates, enlightens with the only inextinguishable and true
Light in the entire world, namely, with the God-man
Christ. Darkness cannot extinguish or hide this Light,
not even the darkness of Europe. Only this is capable of
expelling all darkness from man, from society, from the
people, and from the state. This, the only true Light,
illuminates every man into the nucleus of his being and
reveals to each one of us our own immortality, our own
divine and eternal brother. It teaches us that only then
can the problems of man and the problems of society,64. ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
the problems of the nation and the problems of humani-
ty, be easily understood and solved when they are
examined through the God-man Christ.
The main guidelines and characteristics of theanthrop-
ic education can be formulated as follows:
1. Man is a being who can be perfected and complet-
ed in the most ideal and real way by the God-man and
in the God-man.
2. The perfection of man by the God-man takes place
with the help of the evangelical witnesses.
3. The illuminated and educated man sees in every
man his immortal and eternal brother.
4. Every human work and_ action—philosophy,
science, geography, art, education, culture, manual
labor, etc.—receives its eternal value when it is sancti-
fied and receives meaning from the God-man.
5. True enlightenment and education is accomplished
through a holy life according to the gospel of Christ.
6. The saints are the most perfect illuminators and
educators; the more holy a man is the better an educator
and illuminator he becomes.
7. School is the second half of the heart of the God-
man; the first is the Church.
8. At the center of all centers and of all ideas and
labors stands the God-man Christ and His theanthropic
society, the Church.THE HIGHEST VALUE AND
LAST CRITERION IN ORTHODOXY
Wren man is awakened from his earthly body and
recognizes spiritual realities, he realizes that the things
that are of a material nature must indeed be real since
it is his intellect that is able to perceive them as such.
From here, man arrives at the following paradoxical
observation: As a unique creature, man knows the
reality of the material world through his intellect, which
itself does not share in the attributes of the material
realm nor can itself become a material object, neither
being shown as a super-subjective reality, nor can it
become tangible through the senses. Even though the
human intellect is incomprehensible through the forms
of material reality, nonetheless, the invisible essence of
the intellect constitutes the criterion for all the visible
realities in the material realm. Indeed, man often feels
and frequently understands that the intellect, even
though it is untouchable, invisible, and immaterial, is
however, more real than any other super-subjective
reality existing in the material world.
Furthermore, all realities have their foundation in the
intellect which is itself immaterial. It is precisely here
that the supremacy, mystery, and grandeur of the
human mind is to be found. The awakened man, guided
by his immaterial mind through the mystery of the
material, natural world, understands more clearly that
6566 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
his mind is his greatest and most immediate reality and
at the same time is that which is most valuable to him.
Existing in such a condition, man senses the irrefutable
truth of the words of the Savior that the human soul is
the greatest reality and has the greatest worth—a reality
more real than the whole visible world and a worth
more valuable than the entire universe: "For what will
it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits
his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his
soul?" (Matt. 16: 26; Mark 8: 36-37). In other words, in
the material world there is nothing equal in value to the
value of the human soul, nor is there anything by which
the soul can be appraised or ransomed. The soul is
worth more than the entire universe.
Man lays the foundation for his visible life, for his life
in time and space, on the invisible, that is, on the soul,
on its thoughts and on its conscience. In the world of
visible realities and occurrences, man is oriented by his
intellect, and by it he measures and values everything,
even though it remains invisible. Yet it is more natural
and reasonable for him to be oriented by it in the realm
of spiritual realities and values. Not only is man con-
nected by his intellect to the world of visible, material
realities, but also to the world of spiritual realities. Even
the most extreme sensualists cannot deny this. We must
confess that the human mind is a miraculous workplace
in which the impressions of the senses are transformed,
in an inconceivable manner, into thoughts. The serious
observer of the world, from whatever side he approach-
es material or spiritual realities, is compelled to recog-
nize the infinite mystery contained in all phenomena.
This is the tribute that every thinker owes to the enig-
matic mystery of the world. Undoubtedly, the proper
orientation toward our enigmatic world depends on theHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 67
human spirit, or more precisely, on the nature of the
spirit by which man is oriented. The human spirit
expresses and reveals its nature on account of the
experience it receives through its activities. From all this
experience the human spirit derives the longing for the
infinite in all its manifestations: in knowledge, in life,
and in existence.
The human spirit longs for infinite knowledge, infinite
life, and infinite existence. Yet through all this, man
seeks only one thing: the conquering of the temporal,
the finite, the limited and the possibility of securing the
eternal, the infinite, and the unlimited. In all cultures
and civilizations, the labors of the human spirit are
eventually consolidated into one enormous endeavor: to
overcome death and mortality and to secure immortality
and eternal life in any way possible.
Does not all of this force us to put forward the
question: wheredoestheyearningof the humanmind
and its orientation towards the infinite come from?
‘What is it that prompts human thought from question
to question and from infinitude to infinitude? If this
longing for the infinite is forced upon the weak man
from the outside, howis it, then, that it also exists in the
most independently minded of the philosophers? This is
so especially, since among them this longing for the
infinite is developed into complicated philosophies. All
of this proves that the longing for the infinite is found
in the nature of the human mind itself. The nature of
knowledge tends toward infinite knowledge; the nature
of the senses tends toward infinite sensuality; the nature
of life itself tends towards infinite life. The entire spirit
of man, through his knowledge, senses, will and life,
desires to be infinite, that is, to be immortal. The thirst
for the infinite, the thirst for immortality is the ancient68 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
metaphysical thirst of the human spirit. This iswhat has
driven the spirit of man towards the infinite through
numerous religions, philosophies, sciences, struggle, and
strife. In a word: the human spirit longs for immortality,
desiring it in whatever way and form.
It is evident that this yearning for the infinite cannot
derive from the nature of man, since his nature is itself
finite and limited and does not naturally contain this
yearning. In the same way, it is evident that the human
body has not implanted in man this longing because it
too is finite. The only possible explanation is that man’s
longing for the infinite, for immortality, lies in the
essence of the human spirit itself. Being created in the
image of God, this longing is found totally in man. The
image of God in man is exactly that which longs for the
infinite truths of God throughout the entire world.
Existing in man’s spirit, the divine image propels man
toward the infiniteness of God and causes him to yearn
after it.
It is only natural that the God-like soul, created
according to the divine image, longs after God as its
prototype. This discovery is not a priori, but beyond
doubt a, posterior since the entire experience of the
human race testifies to the strong and mystical nostalgia
of the human spirit for the infinite, the immortal, the

into man’s very being the longing for the divine infini-
tude of life, of knowledge, and of perfection. It is pre-Highest Valueand Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 69
cisely for this reason that the immeasurable longing and
thirst of humanity is not able to be completely satisfied
by anything or anyone except God. Declaring divine
perfection as the main purpose for humanity’s existence
in the world—"Be ye therefore. perfect, even as your
Father who is in heaven is perfect." (Matth. 5: 48)—
Christ, the Savior, answered the most elemental demand
and need of our God-like and God-longing humanity.
The God-like nature of humanity has its own onto-
logical and teleological significance: ontological, because
the essence of the human being is to be found in its
divine-like constitution as something which is an
undeniable fact; teleological, since by this nature, God,
with all His divine perfection, has been defined as the
goal of the life of man. This divine likeness is the
essence of the human being. Man shapes and builds his
life in this world according to this likeness. Indeed, the
essence of man is first constituted by God and secondly
by man. In other words, man is created by virtue of a
divine-human being, who has an obligation, led by his
God-like soul, to assimilate everything in him to God
and in this way to become a divine-like human being,
that is, abeing who is united in a perfect way with God
and living within the bounds of God’s divine and
infinite perfection. However, instead of imbuing his
empirical life with his God-like soul, he has separated
his spirit from all that is divine within him, and pro-
ceeds, without God, that is, without his natural guide,
into the mysteries of this world. Thus alone in this
world, he encounters unbridgeable abysses and frighten-
ing chasms.
The fall of man essentially consists in his revolt
against the God-like constitution of his being. Man
abandoned God and the things of God, and limited70 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
himself to the material world—to a naked and unclad
man. With this first revolt against God, man succeeded
in expelling God from himself, from his conscience, and
from his will, and remained in his pure human nature,
in his pure humanity (homo,hominis), and in this way, in
pure humanism—Horribile dictu—and it is humanism
that is precisely the basic and original evil of man. In
the name of autonomous humanism, man expelled God
and became a metaphysically superhuman being,

earened tony to reappear aed ie guise of man’s
longing for infinite progress, infinite knowledge, infinite
perfection, and infinite existence. Consciously or uncon-
sciously, as man labors in his humanism he tends to
bring back to himself his lost divine-likeness. In part he
is successful: for by necessity he understands that with
his pure humanity alone, that is, his humanity without
God, he is incapable of correcting his spirit and of
restoring his divine-like being. In all his humanistic
longings, man is in fact crying out for the God-man.
The appearance in this world, then, of the God-man
Christ was natural, rational, and necessary. For only ‘God-mancan compl Hpee
we which became sic O :
Only He can satisfy avery thirst of our God-
aa essence:our thirst for infinite life, infinite justice,
infinite truth, infinite good, and for the divine infini-
tude.
The most essential ontological requirements and needs
of humanity have been satisfied once and for all in the
person of the God-man Christ. In all the requirements
and needs of the human spirit related to this world
the’Highest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 71
which are beyond man’s grasp, the God-man provides
answers as God in a human way, while in all the
requirements and needs of the human spirit related to
this world which concern man and are under his
provenance, the God-man answers as man in a divine
way. The God-like possibilities which exist in man’s
being, and which were enslaved in the tyranny of
humanism, the God-man liberates and revitalizes in
order for them to regain their immortal fullness. The
man who is led by the God-man regulates all that is
within him according to God and lives in this enigmatic
world by God’s commands. Thus he reaches ideal
perfection, and he himself constitutes the most perfect
composition of the divine and the human, of the spiritu-
al and material, of the present and of the beyond.
The appearance of the God-man Christ in the world
of human realities does not constitute something unex-
pected for human nature, neither ontologically, psycho-
logically, nor historically. On the contrary, this appear-
ance has satisfied the fundamental longings and the
essential needs of human existence—the thirst and
desire for divine perfection and eternal life. The God-
man is not something which is unnatural and nonessen-
tial for the human person, but rather he is that which is
the most essential of all things, so much so that He
Himself, the all True God and Lord Jesus, declares that
He is that "one thing which is needful” (Luke 10: 42).
Why? This is so because he dissolved the separation
between God and humanity in a most perfect, natural,
rational, and teleological way. How? He does this by
revealing to us in Himself God in a real and physical
way, in His absolute truth, absolute goodness, absolute
justice, absolute love, and absolute wisdom, who is in
perfect unity with man; and He simultaneously revealslips ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
in Himself man in his purity, immortality, and perfec-
tion.
The God-man equally reveals God in His perfection
and man in his perfection. When we impartially exam-
ine the history of the human race, we must confess that
there in no greater man than Jesus. This equally means
that there is no greater God than Jesus as well. Only
Jesus as God-man was and is the greatest man, that is,
a man without sin and evil. As the only sinless one,
Christ could ask his greatest enemies without fear,
"Which of you convicts me of sin?" (John 8: 46). Not one
of his accusers could attribute any sin to Him. The man,
therefore, who is without sin is the most ideal and most
real man since only someone such as this is truly
perfect, immortal, and eternal.
Perfect divine wisdom, logic, and intelligence has
entered into human nature through the incarnation of
the divine Logos. That the Logos was made flesh John
1: 14) signifies that all the transcendent divine values
penetrated and became internally united (that is, they
became immanent) within human nature, since they are
related to the God-like human soul. All these divine
values, enfleshed in man, are in the end united in one
inordinate and incomparable value: in the God-man
Christ. This is why the God-man has the first, the
highest, the most fundamental, and the utmost value for
the human world. Nothing is more human than Jesus
Christ who personifies in Himself the most ideal perfec-
tion of anything human. Further, as the God-man
Himself, he is the most perfect unity of the divine and
the human, of the present and the beyond, of the natural
and the supernatural, of the material and the metaphysi-
cal, of the practical and the ideal. In Him, as in the God-
man, the equilibrium between the divine and the humanHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 73
is realized and safeguarded while simultaneously
preserving the autonomy of the human and the divine.
There is realized the most radical, rational, and perfect
unity of the present life with the life that lies beyond in
the divine-human person of Christ. Likewise, there is
also found in the person of Christ the unity of the
present knowledge and the knowledge of the beyond as
well as the unity of human and divine feelings. This
means that the life, thought, and feelings of man have
bridged the abyss which separates man from God, the
abyss between this world and the other. It is for this
reason that a man living a life in Christ vividly experi-
ences the unity of this world with the other, the unity of
God with man, the worldly with the transcendent, the
natural with the supernatural. Man strongly senses and
perceives clearly that in him the transition from the
mortal to the immortal, the temporal to the eternal, is
realized. This perception of eternal life secures the
eternity of thoughts and the immortality of feelings for
the man who lives a life in Christ.
Although the man who lives in Christ is extended in
this way, expanded, engulfed in the divine infinitude, he
does not, however, lose his human identity, his person-
ality, nor his character but remains man: a perfect man,
human and divine. It is in the God-man Christ that
humanity is for the first time raised to the summit of
perfection, to the summit above all summits. For no one
glorifies human nature or the human person as much as
the God-man does. The greatest possible righteousness
was given to humanity in the person of the God-man.
Humanity was not undervalued in relation to God, nor
was God in relation to man. Rather, man was infinitely
exalted, elevated, and glorified in relation to God.74 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Undeniably, the problem of good and evil is one of
the most difficult and tormenting problems facing the
human conscience. Yet even this problem was finally
and effectively solved in the person of the God-man
Christ. It was not solved through words, nor theoreti-
cally or dialectically, but rather essentially in a divine-
human way. In every aspect of his life, the God-man
Jesus was revealed as the incarnate one—as the incarna-
tion of the infinite, the most perfect, and absolute good.
The keenest eye could not find the most minuscule evil
in Him, because "He committed no sin; no guile was
found on his lips" (1 Peter 2: 22). Human knowledge
confronts, in the person of the God-man Christ, the
absolute divine good and acknowledges through Him,
even in the limits of human existence, what is good and
what is evil, just as the human heart through Him is
able to sense good and evil in a concrete way. The good,
the eternal good, is whatever Christ is in His divine-
human reality, that is the entire divine | man. Being
sinless and omnipotent, the
Auman nature the divine ¢
diane good and to completely c ier: sin—— evil! It is
for this reason that the God-man Jesus is the most
valuable person throughout the entire cosmos in which
human thought and feelings operate.
Throughout his entire history, man appears as a
unique type of creature who has laboriously sought the
fundamental and essential truth upon which the founda-
tion of the cosmos rests. Man has attempted to answer
the quest for truth in various ways—mythologically,
philosophically, atheistically, spiritually, and materialisti-
cally. However, he has not been able to solve the
problem since he has tried to solve it with the categoriesHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 75
of pure, autonomous, and atheistic humanism. Only in
the miraculous person of the God-man Christ is the
entire eternal Truth revealed, without any defects.
Further, the search for eternal truth is completed in the
revelation of the absolute divine Truth within the
boundaries of human nature. Thus, from the mouth of
the God-man Christ came the most courageous declara-
tion that a human being could possibly give: "I am the
Truth” John 14: 6). This means that the God-man Christ,
as a person, is the truth in all His theanthropic perfec-
tion and reality.
The one act which makes the God-man Christ, in
particular, the most valuable of all beings is that He is —
the first and only to have completely and otfectivelt
resolved the age-old dilemma of life and death. He has
“done this by revealing in His God-man person, the
incarnate one, immortality and eternal life. This is
especially demonstrated by His Resurrection and
Ascension to the eternal life of the divine One. The
entire theanthropic life of Christ both before and after
His resurrection is evident proof that He is the personi-
fication of immortality and eternal life and therefore the
master over death. By His Resurrection He insured for
human nature victory over death, and by His Ascension
immortal life in the eternity of the Triune God. For this
reason, he alone among the human race is justified in
saying: "I am the Resurrection and the life" (John 11: 25).
He is the resurrection and the life in His God-human
character on account of His sinlessness. Where there is
no sin there is no death, since only sin creates death. As
sin is the only cause of death, thus sinlessness, namely
perfect holiness, is the only cause of immortality.
The mystery of the world and that of man are
brought together in the human conscience. The entire76 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
creation is covered by an opaque darkness which
human reason is incapable of penetrating to its funda-
mental meaning in order to comprehend why the world
exists in its present state and form. Only by being
illuminated with the light of the God-man Christ does
the world open the blossom of its essence to us and thus
reveals its true meaning and value. That is why the
Savior said: "I am the light of the world" john 8: 12; 9:
5). In the God-man Christ and through His light man for
the first time opened his eyes and saw the light while
comprehending the true meaning of the world.
There is a certain amount of divine wisdom and
purpose that is diffused throughout the entire creation.
It is dispersed by Christ Himself, by the eternal Logos
of God, and for this reason it is said in the Holy Gospel:
"All things were made by Him" (John 1: 3). The reason-
ableness (logosnost) and wisdom in this world, and in
the entire creation, is made evident in the light of the
incarnate Logos of God. The human mind (logos), only
when illuminated by the light of the incarnate God, is
capable of comprehending the divine-rational (logosni)
meaning of creation, that is, the meaning of the divine
Logos in creation, as one is persuaded in this way
through the truth of the words of the Apostle: "For all
things were created through Christ and in Him" (Col. 1:
16). Thus, every created being individually and the
entire created world collectively ought to realize in
themselves the truth and justice of the God-man Christ
up to their utmost potential. Heaven and earth will not
pass away until the law of divine Boeos has pew
fulfilled in all things (cf.Matth. 5: 18). It was in the God-
_
man that the cleansing, renewal, and re store — MmoO
"creation began—since creation had become i ,Highest Valueand Last Criterionin Orthodoxy 7
been transformed into chaos'due to the presence and
power of human sin and evil (cf.Rom. 8: 19-23).
+ + *
Christ, as the divine-human Person, is the most
valuable of all beings and as such he is at the same time
the highest criterion of all true values. In this world any
being inferior to the God-man cannot become the
criterion of all values because that which is of the
greatest value is none other than the Person of the God-
man himself. Man cannot be the criterion since his value
is much less than that of the God-man. The God-man
constitutes the highest criterion of anything divine or
human both in this world and the next simply because
he is the most valuable of all beings. History does not
know a greater God than Christ, nor a greater man than
Christ. The God-man has revealed both simultaneously
and completely God and man. Therefore, there is no
God without the God-man and there is no man without
the God-man.
"What is truth?" inquired Pilate of the incarnate Truth,
wanting to hear with his own ears that which he did not
perceive with his eyes, as though it was not the same
soul that was hearing through his ears and seeing
through his eyes. The God-man Christ is the Truth, not
as word, neither as teaching nor as concrete energy, but
as a most perfect and eternally living divine-human
Hypostasis. It is only as a theanthropic Personality that
He is the criterion of truth. It is for this reason that the
God-man not only said "I am the Truth,” but also that,
"I am the Way" (John 14: 6), that is, He is the way to
Truth itself, the criterion of Truth itself, the essence of
Truth itself. The criterion of Truth is the Truth itself, and78 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
the Truth is the God-man Christ. Thus, whatever does
not come from Him is not from the Truth. The Truth
cannot ontologically exist outside of His divine-human
personality.
In Christianity truth is not a philosophical concept,
nor is it a theory, a teaching, or a system, but rather, it
is the living theanthropic hypostasis—the historical Jesus
Christ John 14: 6). Before Christ men could only conjec-
ture about the Truth since they did not possess it. With
Christ as the incarnate divine Logos the eternally
complete divine Truth enters into the world. For this
reason the Gospel says: "Truth came by Jesus Christ"
(John 1: 17).
What is life, real true life, and what is the criterion of
life? It is none other than the Person of the God-man
Christ. It is the Person and not merely his teachings
separated from his miraculous and life-giving Person.
On account of humanity’s inescapable mortality no man
has ever dared to say: I am the life. The God-man,
however, said: "I am the Life" (John 14: 6). He said this
justifiably since he conquered death by his resurrection
and showed himself to be eternally alive by his Ascen-
sion and through him being placed at the right hand of
the Father. For this reason the God-man is also the Life
and the criterion of Life. Whatever does not come from
Him is dead. In Him life finds its rationality (logosnost)
and its reasonableness because it finds its divine eterni-
ty. As the eternal divine Logos He is both life and all-
life (svezivot, cf. John 1: 4) since life is only life through.

who makes life really life.Rebelliot ym Him -who is

reason that only in Him, as the Logos and the Reason ofHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 79
life, can one find the only possible rational justification
for the existence of life in the category of time and
space.
Eternal life is nourished and preserved through the
eternal good, justice, truth, wisdom, and light. When the
Savior proclaimed: "I am the Life," He was also pro-
claiming the following: I am the Good, I am the Justice,
I am the Truth, I am the Wisdom, I am the Light. Since
then, He is all of these simultaneously; He is also the
highest criterion of all of these. By his most perfect
personality, the sinless God-man constitutes for the
human race the only infallible criterion of life, goodness,
justice, truth, wisdom, and light. The God-man is the
highest and most perfect being, the only eternal being
and therefore the highest and most perfect criterion, the
only eternal criterion, of truth, life, justice, light, good-
ness, and wisdom.
Christ sums up all of His teaching and work in His
theanthropic person and interprets them through Him.
On account of this, the Apostolic Orthodox Church of
Christ sums up all of Christianity in the life-giving
person of the God-man Christ: instruction, truth, justice,
goodness, and life. The Person of the God-man Christ is
the Church’s most valuable treasure. All other treasures,
the Orthodox Church receives as rays of the sun, from
the unique Sun, Christ.
We must not be mistaken: Christianity is Christianity
only on account of the God-man; in this lies its extraor-
dinary meaning, value, and power. The God-man Christ,
the theanthropic personality, remains with us as the
Church. The Church is the Church only through the80 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
God-man and in the God-man. The New Testament can
be summed up in one, this one comprehensive truth: the
God-man is the essence, the purpose, the meaning, and
the essential value of the Church. He is its soul, its
heart, and its life. He is the Church in its entire theanth-
ropic fullness. The Church is nothing other than the
God-man Christ projected through all the centuries:
"And lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age"
(Matth. 28: 20; cf. Eph. 1: 21-23).
The God-man is the head of the body of the Church
(Col. 1: 18; Eph. 1: 22, 5: 23). As such He is also the
Savior of the body of the Church (Eph. 5: 23). It is only
through Him, the unique, and undivided God-man, that
the Church remains one, unique and undivided. As the
God-man, He holds together the whole body of the
Church in one undivided unity of grace, truth, and life.
Through Him the body of the Church grows and
receives all aspects of divine life. The body of the
Church grows according to the measure of the stature of
the theanthropic fullness of Christ, since everything has
been made through Him and in Him (Eph. 4: 13, 15-16;
Col. 1: 10, 16). With the power of His grace He mystical-
ly ("sacramentally") leads all the members of the Church
to the theanthropic creator since the meaning and
purpose of the Church is for everyone to be led by
divine-human faith to the measure of the fullness of
Christ, namely to be refashioned theanthropically.
The Church through its Apostles, martyrs, confessors,
holy Fathers, and its faithful members has, more than
any other thing, unhesitatingly confessed and defended
the God-human Hypostasis. The Church, while showing
great mercy towards sinners, has always implacably and
decisively condemned and rejected those who, in
whatever way, have denied, rejected, or disfigured theHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 81
divinity and humanity of Christ. The Church is forever
eager to joyfully walk towards apocalyptic martyrdom
in order to defend and preserve the theanthropic Person
of Christ.
What is the essence of Orthodoxy? It is the God-man
Christ. Everything that is Orthodox has a divine-human
character: knowledge, the senses, the will, the mind,
morality, dogma, philosophy, and life. divine humanity
is the only category in which all the manifestations of
Orthodoxy are received and fully operate. In all of
creation, God occupies the first place, man the second.
God leads while man is led; God acts and man cooper-
ates. God does not act transcendentally. He is not the
abstract God of deism, but rather the God of the most
immediate historic reality, the God of revelation, the
God who became man and lived within the categories
of our human existence while appearing everywhere as
absolute holiness, goodness, wisdom, justice, and truth.
As the perfect God-man, nothing within the categories
of human life remain unknown (cf. John 2: 25; Heb. 2:
14, 17-18). It is precisely for this reason that He became
man, although remaining God, in order to give to
human nature divine power which would lead humani-
ty to an intimate, divine-human, union with God. This
divine power continuously acts within His divine-
human body, that is, the Church, by uniting men with
God through a holy life in grace. The Church is nothing
other than that wondrous divine-human organism
where, through cooperation of divine grace and the free
activity of man, the entire man and everything that is
human, save sin, is immortalized and refashioned in a
divine-human way.
In the divine-human organism of the Church each
believer constitutes a dynamic constituent cell of the82 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
organism and lives by the life-giving, divine-human
power of Christ. For someone to be a member of the
Church, this signifies that he is incorporated into the
God-human Christ and has become united into His one
body (Eph. 3: 16) as an organic member of His divine-
human body (Eph. 5: 30; 1 Cor. 12: 12-13). In a word,
the member of the Church becomes divinely-human in
the fullness of his human personality. When he has suc-
ceeded in this, man arrives at the divine-human unity of
life and experiences the living and immortal realization
that he has passed from death to life John 5: 24; 3: 36;
11: 25-26). He continuously experiences throughout his
entire being that the Church, a divine-human organism,
is the God-man extended into the ages. Christ, as a
divine-human person, is unparalleled, but as theanth-
ropic power and life he continuously reappears in every
Christian, since every Christian is an organic member of
His divine-human body, the Church.
Identifying the Church as the body of Christ (Eph. 1:
23; Col. 1: 24), the holy Apostle connects the Church’s
being with the mystery of the incarnation of the divine
Logos and demonstrates that the living and changeless
foundation of the historical nature of the Church lies
precisely in the reality that the Logos became flesh.’ In
addition, the Apostle demonstrates that the Church,
because she is the body of Christ, constantly depends
upon the incarnate divine Logos for her essential being.
The Church receives her immeasurable fullness of
divine-human grace and power from Christ who fulfills
all things that belong to the Church through Him (cf.
Eph. 1223; Col2:.9):
‘John 1: 14; G. Florovsky, Ocev Dom, “Hriscanski Zivot," 1926,
p. 166.Highest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 83
Both the Church’s ontological existence and all her
activity depend completely upon the incarnate God
since the Church as a whole is founded on the historic
reality of the Gospel: "The Logos became flesh," that is,
became God-man. This is the fundamental truth of the
Church, the foundation of the Church. The Church,
being for all and in all, is foremost a God-human
organism and then a God-human institution.
The whole nature of the Church, in all its manifesta-
tions, has a divine-human character. It is from this
nature that the Church also derives, in a rational way,
her divine-human activity in the world through which
she imparts to humanity all things related to God. The
mission of the Church is to be found in the nature of the
Church and it is here where humanity participates in all
the divine-human values and energies. The incarnation
of God is the final and perfect revelation of God to a
being such as man. Having been made man and not
some other kind of being, God demonstrated that the
God-man is the nature of man’s nature, the logic of
man’s logic, the goodness of man’s goodness, the truth
of man’s truth; in a word, the essence, the meaning, and
the purpose of the God-like soul of man. Therefore, as
the Church confesses the God-man, she simultaneously
confesses the genuine, true, and complete divine-like
man. Except for the God-man there is no genuinely true
man.

According to the Apostle Paul, it is only "with all the
saints" (Eph. 3: 18) that one can fully understand the
mystery of the Person of Christ and can truly and
correctly believe in the God-man Christ. Only living
"with all the saints” in the catholic unity of the faith can
one be a true Christian, a genuine disciple of the God-
man Christ. Indeed, the Church’s life is always catholic
and is realized in communion "with all the saints." The
true member of the Church actively experiences the
realization that he is of the same faith as that of the
Apostles, the Martyrs, and all the Saints throughout the
centuries. He senses that they are eternally present and
that all of them are permeated with one and the same
theanthropic power and energy, one and the same

the communion of the faith, and by the action of the
One Spirit and one grace in all of these. This is none
other than the unity of the body of Christ, the unity of
the house of God, in which all who have fallen asleep in
faith and piety presently live and dwell along with all
the saints and holy fathers. Each priest, when he cele-
brates the divine Liturgy, not only repeats the words
which St. Basil the Great or St. John Chrysostom had
once offered themselves before the holy altar, but, in a
real, though incomprehensible, communion he concele-
brates with them before God. In every divine service the
entire Church is invisibly present, as the true “one flock,
offering common and unanimous prayers and thanks-
givings to the Lord Jesus Christ and His Father. This is
not a psychological or subjective connection with the
past, but the ontological unity of life. In the Church time
comes to a standstill, because here there is no death, and
the interruption of earthly life suspends the living
relationship of the generation.’
In the Church, the past is contemporary; and that
which is present remains so on account of the living
past, since the God-man Christ who is "the same yester-
day, today, and forever" (Heb. 13: 8), continuously lives
in His divine-human body by means of the same truth,
the same holiness, the same goodness, the same life and
establishes the past in the present. Thus, to a living
Orthodox understanding and conscience, all the mem-
bers of the Church, from the Holy Apostles to those
who have recently fallen asleep, are contemporary since
they continuously live in Christ. Further, today in every
true Orthodox individual one can find all the Holy

Apostles, Martyrs, and holy Fathers. For the Orthodox
Christian these are more real than many of his contem-
poraries. “
This sense of the catholic unity of faith, life, and
knowledge constitutes the essence of the Church’s
ecclesial reality. It is this understanding that reveals the
truth of the God-man’s unceasing, life-giving power,
which is revealed unremittingly in the divine-human life
of the Church by the unity, holiness, catholicity, and
apostolicity of the Church’s faith, life, and truth. For
what does it mean for someone to profess to be Ortho-
dox? It means this: to be part of the continuous struggle
that leads from man to God-man, that is, to be involved
in the unending improvement of oneself through the
theanthropic mysteries, struggles, and virtues. Here the
Orthodox Christian is never alone. Every feeling, act,
and thought is both individual and universal, not
merely personal and catholic but theanthropic.
When an Orthodox Christian ponders something, he
does so prayerfully, with fear and trembling, since he
knows that the choir of angels and the entire church
participate mystically with him in his struggle. The
Orthodox Christian does not belong only to himself, but
to all the saints and, through them, to the holy Lord
Jesus. When he examines his own spirit, the Orthodox
Christian reflects: my spirit is nothing unless it is filled
and perfected by the Holy Spirit."
‘In one of his epistles, dated Jan. 21, 1965, Fr. Justin writes, "The
holy mystery of the day of the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, is to be
understood in the following manner: the spirit of man must be
completed and perfected by the Holy Spirit, that is, it must be
sanctified, illuminated, and divinized by the Holy Spirit. This holy
mystery is realized continually in the Church of Christ and becauseHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 87
In the life and soul of an Orthodox Christian nothing
takes place according to man’s desire or will but every-
thing occurs according to the God-man. Through the
exercise of evangelical virtues, the Orthodox Christian
concentrates on God—his spirit, soul and will concen-
trate through the aid of the Holy Spirit. Whatever
belongs to him is gathered and universalized (sabornizira
se) in the God-man. With his entire being he under-
stands that the Orthodox Church is always holy and
catholic and that the attribute of divine humanity is the
unaltered characteristic of the Orthodox Church.
Orthodox Christians are Orthodox because they
maintain a continuous sense of divine-human catholicity
which they preserve and kindle through prayer and
humility. They never preach about themselves; they
never boast; they never remain entirely within their base
human nature; they never idealize humanism. The holy
Christ-bearing Apostles once and for all gave the
definition of the ecclesial dimension of divine humanity:
"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (Acts
15: 28). First, the Holy Spirit, and then, us; "us" in as
much as we allow the Holy Spirit to act through us.
Included in this theanthropic apostolic definition is
the entire method by which the Church carries out her
divine-human activity in the world. The holy martyrs
and confessors, the holy Fathers and Ecumenical Synods
accepted and continued this method. If someone departs
from this method he departs from the Holy Spirit as
well as the holy Apostles, martyrs, fathers, and Oecu-

menical Synods. Further, he deviates from the unity,
holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity of the theanthropic
faith of Christ, that is, he is cut off from the Lord Jesus
Christ. The Orthodox Church is one, holy, catholic, and
apostolic because it does not deviate from this sacred
method. The Church is Orthodox because it continuous-
ly confesses, maintains, and safeguards not only the
theanthropic, apostolic-catholic, ecumenical truth of
Christianity but also the theanthropic, apostolic-catholic,
ecumenical methodology of Christianity. The Lord Jesus
is both the Truth and the Way. If one departs from the
theanthropic methodology, one cannot also avoid
deviating away from the theanthropic truth and the
God-man Christ.
The Orthodox Church contains the complete teaching
of the God-man Christ precisely because it does not
deviate from the theanthropic methodology of the holy
Apostles and the Oecumenical Synods. The believing
individual of the Orthodox, apostolic, and patristic faith
both senses and understands that they are co-workers of
the Holy Spirit only, and as such they constantly listen,
through prayer, to what the Spirit says, do what the
Spirit asks of them, and continually examine their own
thoughts and words by the Spirit. Since the catholic
unity of the theanthropic Truth is always present in the
catholic conscience of the Orthodox Church, the holy
Fathers and Teachers continuously participate in the
theanthropic life of the Church through the charismatic
action of the Holy Spirit. This is reflected in an encycli-
cal issued by Orthodox Patriarchs a few centuries ago:
"We believe that the Holy Spirit instructs the Catholic
Church... The Church is most certainly instructed by the
life-sustaining Spirit through the holy Fathers and
Teachers... We confess that it is impossible for theHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 89
Catholic Church to err or to be completely mistaken or
to choose falsehood instead of truth. The All-holy Spirit,
acting through faithfully serving holy Fathers and
STARE guides delivers the Church from any kind of
error.
n the European West, Christianity gradually became
transformed into humanism. For several centuries the
od-man became more and more limited and confined
to His humanity, eventually becoming the infallible man
of Rome and of Berlin. Thus, on the one hand there
appeared a western Christian humanistic maximalism
(the papacy) which took everything away from Christ,
and on the other hand a western Christian humanistic
minimalism (Protestantism) which sought very little if
anything from Christ. In both man takes the place of the
God-man as that which is of most value and is the
measure of all things. Thus, amost grievous correction
of the God-man, His work, and His teaching was accom-
plished!
The Papacy persistently and continuously tried to
replace the God-man with man, until finally when the
dogma of the infallibility of man supplanted the God-
man with an infallible man. With this dogma, man (the
Pope) was proclaimed decisively and clearly to be
something not only greater than man, but greater than
the holy Apostles, the holy Fathers, and the Oecumen-
ical Synods. With this rebellion against the God-man

in: John Karmires, The Dogmatic and Symbolic Documents of the
Orthodox Catholic Church, vol. 2, p. 755, Athens, 1953.90 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
and the catholic-ecumenical Church, papal maximalism
surpassed even Luther himself, the founder of Protestant
minimalism. Indeed, the first fundamental protest
against the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church is
to be found in the Papacy and not in Lutheranism. Yet
it is precisely in this protest that one finds the origins of
Protestantism.
We must not be mistaken. Western Christian human=
istic maximalism, ie., the Papacy, |is fundamentally A

Protestantism since a removed the foundation of

“fre e eternal God-man and placed it in
finite man claiming this to bethe measure and criterion
_
of all. Protestantism did nothing more than to simply
accept this dogma and to develop it to a point where it
has reached horrendous proportions and particulars.
Truly, then, Protestantism is nothing other than an
abstract papism being applied to everything, that is, the
basic principle of the infallibility of one man has been
applied to every individual human being. According to
the example of the infallible man of Rome, every
Protestant becomes infallible since he claims personal
infallibility in matters of faith. From this it can be said
that Protestantism is a popularized papism lacking
however a mystical dimension, authority, and power.
Christianity, with all its infinite theanthropic truths,
was confined in the West to the human individual with
the result that western Christianity was transformed into
humanism. This may seem paradoxical but it is true.
The historical reality of this is shown in an indisputable
way. In its essence, western Christianity is fundamen-
tally humanistic since it has declared man infallible, thus
transforming the theanthropic religion into a humanistic
one. Proof of this is found in the fact that the Roman
Church transported the God-man back to heaven and inHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy oI
His place put a substitute: Vicarius Christi... What a
tragic absurdity: to appoint a substitute and representa-
tive for the all-present Lord and God! It is, however, a
fact that this absurdity was realized in western Chris-
tianity.
Thus, the de-incarnation of fhe incarnate God, the de-
incarnation of the God-man, was somehow accom-
plished. Western Christian humanism proclaimed that
the all-present God-man was not present in Rome and
thus appointed His substitute in the person of an
infallible man. It is as if this humanism were saying to
the God-man: Depart from this world and go to the next
since we have your representative who infallibly repre-
sents you in everything.
The replacement of the God-man with a human
person is reflected in the replacement of a Christian
theanthropic methodology by a human one. From this
replacement has emerged the primacy of Aristotelian
philosophy in Scholasticism, the causative method and
the holy inquisition in morality, papal diplomacy in the
international arena, the papal state, forgiveness of sins
through both indulgences and the radio and finally the
Jesuit movement in its various forms.
All this leads to the following conclusion: Humanistic
Christianity constitutes the most decisive protest against
the God-man and His role as the criterion of all things.
Certainly, one also finds here the appearance of the
tendency of European man to view humanity as the
sum of all things as well as the basic value and funda-
mental measure of all things. Behind this there stands an
idol: Menschliches, Allzumenschliches (human, very
human).
In the act ofreducing Christianity to humanism,
Christianityitself has been simplified.At the same time,92 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
however, it has also been destroyed. However, since
there has been a reemergence of Christianity with
humanism today, people are considering replacing
humanistic Christianity with ancient polytheistic reli-
gion. The voices of some people in the Protestant world
crying, "Zurtick zu Jesus! Back to Jesus!" constitute weak
cries in the moonless night of humanistic Christianity. It
is this Christianity which has abandoned theanthropic
values and criteria and is presently drowning in desper-
ation and stalemate while from the depths of the
centuries echo the harsh words of the bereaved prophet
of God, Jeremiah: "Cursed is the man who trusts in
man" (Jer. 17: 5).
In broad historical perspective, western dogma
concerning the infallibility of humanity is nothing other
than an effort to revitalize and perpetuate a dying
European humanism. This is the last transformation
(transformatio) and final glorification (glorificatio) of
humanism. After the rationalistic enlightenment of the
eighteenth century and the myopic positivism of the
nineteenth, nothing else remains within European
humanism except for its decomposition into contradic-
tion and passivity. At this tragic moment religious
humanism appeared with the dogma of the infallibility
of man and saved European humanism from immanent
death. Yet even with its extreme dogmatic tendencies,
western Christian humanism could not contain within
itself all the deadly contradictions of European human-
ism which converge in one wish: that the God-man be
removed from earth to heaven. This is so since the
fundamental tenet of humanism is that man is to
become the most valuable being and the measure of all
things.
* + *€Highest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 93
In the end, Christianity is Christianity precisely
because of the God-man, His divine-human truth, and
the theanthropic way of life that Christianity offers. This
is the fundamental truth against which no compromises
can be made. The entire Christian understanding of
what is valuable and worthy is defined and determined
by this. Christ, as the God-man, is the most valuable
being and the infallible measure of all things. We,
therefore, must be sincere and consistent to the end. If
Christ is not both God and man, then He becomes the
most audaciously self-proclaimed being since he de-
clares himself to be God and Lord. Yet the evangelical
historical reality demonstrates and proves unconditional-
ly that Jesus Christ is fully and completely the perfect
God-man. No one can be a Christian without believing
in the God-man and in his theanthropic body, the
Church, in which Christ has entirely deposited his
wondrous personality. The saving and life-giving power
of the Church of Christ lies in the eternally alive and
ever-present Person of the God-man. Any attempt to
replace the God-man with a man or to chose only those
elements of Christianity which satisfy one’s "personal
taste" or one’s individual understanding changes
Christianity into a superficial and weak humanism.
Everything under the sun is old except for the Personali-
ty of the God-man Christ. He is the only being that is
new; he is eternally new.’ This is what makes the New
Testament new and the truth of the gospel always new
and eternal. Since the personality of the God-man is
eternally new and youthful in its theanthropic perfec-

tion, it cannot be exchanged or replaced; it is always
and consistently the same. Therefore, the Gospel is
always and everywhere the same: for those who live on
earth as well as for the angels in heaven. The God-man
Christ is the unique Logos, the unique mind, the unique
meaning of both man and creation. Without Him it is
impossible for even the smallest ordeal to be accepted in
the world or in a human being like us.
From a purely ontological point of view, the God-man
is not a miracle but rather a necessity for a world and a
humanity such as ours. For this reason the Holy Gospel
says that the divine Logos, being incarnate, "came unto
His own" (John 1: 11). What is it, then, that makes
humanity one of His "own", if it is not the human
being’s God-like soul? Again it is said, "For we are His
offspring" (Acts 17: 28). Once again we are identified
with Him on account of our God-like soul. Elsewhere
the Gospel tells us that the divine Logos is, "the true
light that enlightens every man who comes into the
world" (John 1: 9). Therefore, when He became incar-
nate, He came not to strangers but to his own. In
proclaiming the God-man we confess our Christ-like
humanity, the divine origin of man, the divine grandeur
of man as well as the divine value and sacredness of the
human person. If this is not how things are, then for
what reason are we "like" the divine Logos and "off-
spring" of God? In essence, the struggle for the God-
man is a struggle for humanity. It is not the humanist
who is fighting for the true man, the divine-like and
Christ-like man, but rather men of theanthropic faith
and life.
The exceptional importance of Christianity for the
human race lies in the life-giving and unalterable
divinity and humanity of Christ. It is this divine-humanHighest Value and Last Criterion in Orthodoxy 95
Christ who gives meaning to everything human and
transforms the worthlessness of non-being into the light
of all-being. It is only through its divine-human power
that Christianity is the "salt" of the earth, a salt which
preserves humanity from decomposing into sin and evil.
If, however, Christianity becomes decomposed into
various humanistic elements, then it becomes lifeless, it
becomes a "saltless" salt, which, according to the ever-
true word of the Savior, "is no longer good for anything
except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by
men" (Matth. 5: 13). Every effort and attempt to normal-
ize (gleichschalten) Christianity with the spirit of the age,
with the fleeting movements of various historical epochs
or with political regimes only removes that distinctive
characteristic from Christianity which makes it the
unique theanthropic religion in the world.
Not conforming the God-man Christ to the spirit of
the age but rather conforming and adjusting the spirit of
the age to the spirit of the eternity of Christ, to the
divine humanity of Christ—this is the unique and true
mission of the Church of Christ in the world, of the
Apostolic and Orthodox Church. Only in this way will
the Church be able to preserve the life-giving and
irreplaceable Personality of the God-man Christ, which
is in Itself the most valuable being in all the universe, in
the visible and invisible worlds as well as the world to
come. He is that which is of the highest value and the
infallible measure of all.5 a TIS . ed 2: y

OF EUROPEAN MAN
le Arter God, man is, without a doubt, the most
mysterious and enigmatic entity in all the realms of
human thought. At the bottomless depth of human
existence there whirl contradictions which defy recon-
ciliation: life and death, virtue and evil, God and devil,
and all that exists in and around them. Through all its
religions, philosophies, sciences, spiritual and materi-
alistic civilizations, the human race has been trying to
solve essentially one problem, one all-encompassing
problem: the problem of man. And from all these
exertions and struggles it has fashioned for itself one
supreme godhead, to be worshipped as the highest
value and the foremost criterion. That ultimate godhead
is "Man is the measure of everything." That is to say,
man is the measure of all being and of all things.
However, through this method—his own Divine majes-
ty—man has failed to solve the problem of man. In
measuring himself by himself he has failed to under-
stand either himself or the world around him (cf. 2 Cor.
10: 12). He has labored in vain. He has mirrored a
reflection in a looking-glass. And he has summed up
everything in the agonized cry and the trembling
confession: "By myself I know nothing" (1 Cor. 4: 4). "I
know nothing by myself. I don’t know what is man, nor
what is God, nor what is death, nor what is life. And I
oF,98 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
feel with all my being that I am a slave to death, a slave
to evil, and through my sins a slave to the devil." The
yield of all this human exertion has been to weave a
body out of all the human race: "the body of death,” of
which every man has become a part. And what is
hidden within this body of death?—stench, putrefaction,
maggots. "Wretch that I am! Who will deliver me from
the body of this death?" (Rom. 7: 24).
No one, no one save the God-man because the
God-man Christ triumphed over death by His Resur-
rection. He destroyed "the body of death" as an onto-
logical reality (cf. Rev. 20: 14, 10). He redeemed the
human race from death and granted the gift of eternal
Life, eternal Truth, eternal Love, eternal Justice, eternal
Joy, and all the other eternal Divine Virtues which can
only be granted by the God of Love, the Lover of
Mankind. And so He solved the problem of man, the
entire problem of mankind. When God became man, he
appeared as the God-man, and through his body—the
Church—he has remained as God-man in this terrestrial
world. He has become the ultimate value and the
supreme criterion of the human race forever—the only
True God and the only True Man, the only Perfect God
and the only Perfect Man. As such He is the only
supreme value and the only ultimate criterion of man’s
spiritual and physical being, of his theanthropic poten-
tial, and of all that is human and of man. Only in the
God-man has man seen himself complete and eternal for
the first time. He has recognized himself in all his
dimensions. As a result a new general principal of value
and knowledge applies to the human race: "The God-
man is the measure of everything." Nevertheless, "man
is the measure of everything" continues to reign, to
dominate for the most part, in the idolatrous andReflectionson the Infallibility of European Man ee)

ation. It was clearly interpreted and proclaimed by the
divinely-inspired, saintly, God-bearing Fathers of the
Fourth Oecumenical Synod at Chalcedon. In the God-
man Christ, man has reached his ultimate perfection.
Through God his soul has been perfected and made
complete, along with his conscience, his will, his mind,
his heart, and his body; in a word, his entire being. And
the most important of all miracles, truly worthy of our
love, occurred: the God-man remained in this terrestrial
world and in the entire universe as his Church, as His
Body, so that every individual can join the fellowship of
the body of the God-man and in this way achieve his
full and complete perfection (cf. Eph. 3: 6). Only in the
God-man and through the God-man can each human
individual become truly human, completely human.
Only with the God-man and his Church, and through
his Church "with all the Saints," is it possible to achieve
"complete personhood, as measured by the stature and
fullness of Christ" (Eph. 3: 18, 4: 11-16). In the God-man
Christ "there dwells bodily the entire fullness of the
Godhead," so that, in the Church and through the
Church, the fullness of the Godhead can be bestowed on
each one of us (Col. 2: 9-10). This, however, can be
realized in each of us only "with all the saints,” through100 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
the holy mysteries and the Holy Virtues, and based on
Holy Faith and Holy Love (Eph. 3: 17-20).
Without the God-man, man is in fact without a head,
indeed without a self, without an eternal self, without
an immortal God-like self. Without the God-man, man
does not exist; there is only less-than-man, half-man, or
no man at all. And at this point we must add the
following truth: without the God-man, man is always a
slave to death, a slave to sin, a slave to the devil. Only
through the God-man does man realize his God-ordain-
ed potential. He becomes "God by grace" and in this
way achieves the full potential of his existence and his
personhood. He reaches his Divine eternity through
God’s humanity. Living in the theanthropic body of the
Church "with all the Saints" man achieves theosis by
degrees, through the holy mysteries and the Holy
Virtues. And he is filled with the joy of the holy mes-
sage and the heavenly commandment of Saint Basil the
Great: "A creature of God comes into existence and God
is called."’ Created with the potential to become God-
man, man strives, within the theanthropic body of the
Church, to make his mind resemble that of God, to
achieve transformation into God-mind. "We have the
mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2: 16). He even strives to resem-
ble the will of God, to transform his will to God-will,
and to make his body similar to the body of the God-
man, to transform it to God-body. "The body is for the
Lord and the Lord is for the body” (1 Cor. 6: 13).
Theanthropized through the Church and in the Church,
man reestablishes himself in his original God-like state,
achieving this in ever-increasing measure through the
"Patrologia Graeca,Vol. 35, Col. 506.Reflectionson the Infallibilityof EuropeanMan 101
Divine virtue of excellent Christ-like ideas (Gal. 4: 19, 3:
27; Rom. 8: 29). But without the God-man and inde-
pendently of Him, man always risks the danger of
becoming like the devil, since sin is simultaneously the
strength and the icon of the devil. Functioning indepen-
dently of the God-man, man voluntarily reduces himself
to a devil-like state of sin. He becomes a relative of the
devil. "He that commits sin is of the devil" (1 John 3: 8).
We must not forget that the principal objective of the
devil is to deprive man of his God-like potential, to
de-theanthropize him, to delete his Divinity, and to thus
transform him into a being similar to himself. Human-
istic anthropocentricity is in essence devilcenteredness.
They both wish one thing: to belong only to themselves,
to be only in themselves and for themselves. However,
in this way, they actually bring themselves to the
kingdom of the "second death" where there is neither
God nor anything of God’s (Rev. 21: 8, 20: 14).
That which has been discussed to this point is nothing
other than the evangelical, apostolic, patristic, Orthodox
humanism of God (Theohumanism, Theohominism).
3. All the European humanisms, from the most
primitive to the most sophisticated, from the fetishistic
to the papal, are based on a belief in man as he finds
himself in the midst of his given spiritual and physical
empirical situation and his historical context. In this
view the entire essence of every humanism is man
(homo), and encapsulated in the ontology of every
humanism is nothing other than humanism (homo
hominis). Man is the highest value, the supreme value.
Man is the principal criterion, the ultimate criterion.
"Man is the measure of everything." That, at its core (in
nuce), is every humanism, every homanism. Therefore,102 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
all humanisms, all hominisms are, in the final analysis,
idolatrous and polytheistic in origin. Pre-Renaissance,
Renaissance, and post-Renaissance—Protestant, philo-
sophical, religious, social, scientific, cultural, or political
—all the European humanisms strive consciously or
subconsciously, but they strive unceasingly, for one
result: to replace faith in the God-man with a belief in
man, to replace the Gospel of the God-man with a
gospel according to man, to replace the philosophy of
the God-man with a philosophy according to man, to
replace the culture of the God-man with a culture
according to man. In brief, they seek to replace life
according to the God-man with life according to man.
This has been developing for centuries until in the last
century, in 1870 at the First Vatican Council, all these
efforts achieved their pinnacle in the dogma of the
infallibility of the Pope. This dogma subsequently
became the central dogma of the papacy. In our own
times, during the Second Vatican Council, this doctrine
was discussed so persistently and so skillfully that the
notion of its inviolability and inalterability was strongly
reinforced. This doctrine has an overwhelming signifi-
cance for the fate of European civilization, and for the
apocalyptic times into which it has brought itself.
Through this dogma all European humanisms have built
their ideals and their idol: man has been declared the
supreme godhead, the ultimate godhead. The European
humanistic pantheon has established its Zeus.
Honesty is the language of Truth: the dogma con-
cerning the infallibility of the 20th century pope is
nothing other than the rebirth of idolatry and polythe-
ism, the rebirth of idolatrous value judgments and
criteria. Horrible dictu, but this also has to be said: the
dogma concerning the infallibility of the pope wasReflectionson the Infallibility of European Man 103
introduced in the dogma of idolatrous humanism which,
in the first instance, was Hellenic humanism. The value
of everything was introduced as dogma. All characteris-
tics of Hellenic culture and Hellenic civilization, their
values, their philosophies, their crafts, their politics, their
science were all introduced as dogma: "The measure of
everything is man." And what does this amount to? It is
a recitation of the dogma of idolatry. In this manner the
point in time arrived when the self-sufficiency of
European man became dogma, an objective for which
European humanisms have longed for nostalgically for
centuries.
The dogma regarding the infallibility of the pope is
the Nietzschean assertion—Ja-Sagung— extended to the
entire conception of European humanism. Ja-Sagung is
part of European culture and civilization, both of which
are effectively idolatrous and polytheistic in their
objectives and their methods. The Gospel and the
Commandment of the God-man are "Seek first the
kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all (other
things) shall be added to you" (Matth. 6: 33). But note
what has been omitted from the proclamation of Euro-
pean humanistic culture and its civilization. There is no
mention of the purpose of human existence or of the
means by which man functions. The God-man is the
Only Savior of man from his sins, from his death, and
from the devil, the Only One who renews and immortal-
izes, who resurrects and elevates, who makes eternal
and Divine, who theanthropizes man in all his worlds,
and who categorically and clearly defines as the su-
preme purpose of the existence and the life of man that
he should become perfect as God is perfect (Matth. 5:
48).104 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
However, what did the European humanist not place,
and what did he not dedicate as the purpose of human
existence, in opposition to Him! The evangelical truth
that "the entire world lies under the sway of the evil
one," requiring the efforts of the God-man on this earth,
cannot be refuted (1 John 5: 19-21). Or, as stated by the
holy apostle Paul, the devil is "the god of this age" (2
Cor. 4: 4). Between such a world which voluntarily "lies
under the sway of the evil one" and the person who
follows the God-man there is no common ground. He
who follows the God-man is not allowed by the firm
direction of Evangelic Truth to coexist with the hu-
manist who justifies all of those things and declares
them to be dogma. At this point it is always necessary
to make a decisive, value-oriented determination and
selection: either the God-man or man. The humanist in
all his efforts represents himself as acting with self-suffi-
ciency as the supreme value and highest criterion. There
is no place here for the God-man. In the kingdom of
humanism the place of the God-man had been usurped
by the Vicarius Christi, and the God-man has thus been
exiled to Heaven. This surely results in a peculiar
deincarnation of Christ the God-man, does it not?
Through the dogma of infallibility the pope usurped
for himself, that is for man, the entire jurisdiction and
all the prerogatives which belong only to the Lord
God-man. He effectively proclaimed himself as the
Church, the papal church, and he has become in her the
be-all and end-all, the self-proclaimed ruler of every-
thing. In this way the dogma of the infallibility of the
pope has been elevated to the central dogma (svedogmat)
of the papacy. And the pope cannot deny this in any
way as long as he remains pope of a humanistic papacy.Reflectionson the Infallibilityof EuropeanMan 105
4. In the history of the human race there have been
three principal falls: that of Adam, that of Judas, and
that of the pope. The principal characteristic of falling
into sin is always the same: wanting to be good for
one’s own sake; wanting to be perfect for one’s own
sake; wanting to be God for one’s own sake. In this
manner, however, man unconsciously equates himself to
the devil, because the devil also wanted to become God
for his own sake, to put himself in the place of God.
And in this self-elevation he instantly became devil,
completely separated from God, and always in opposi-
tion to Him. Therefore, the essence of sin, of every sin
(svegreha), consists of this arrogant self-aggrandizement.
This is the very essence of the devil himself, of Satan. It
is nothing other than one’s wanting to remain within
one’s own being, wanting nothing within one’s self
other than oneself. The entire devil is found here: in the
desire to exclude God, in the desire to always be by
himself, to always belong only to himself, to be entirely
within himself and always for himself, to be forever
hermetically sealed in opposition to God and everything
that belongs to God.
And what is this? It is egotism and self-love embraced
in all eternity, that is to say: it is hell. For that is essen-
tially what the humanist is—entirely within himself, by
himself, for himself, always spitefully closed in opposi-
tion to God. Here lies every humanism, every homin-
ism. The culmination of such satanically oriented
humanism is the desire to become good for the sake of
evil, to become God for the sake of the devil. It proceeds
from the promise of the devil to our forefathers in
Paradise—that with his help, "they would become as
gods" (Gen. 3: 5). Man was created with theanthropic
potential by God who loves mankind, so that he might106 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
voluntarily direct himself, through God, toward becom-
ing God-man, based on the divinity of his nature. Man,
however, with his free will sought sinlessness through
sin, sought God through the devil. And assuredly,
following this road he would have become identical
with the devil had not God interceded in His immeasur-
able love of mankind and in His great mercy. By
becoming man, that is to say God-man, he redirected
man toward the God-man. He introduced him to the
Church which is his body, to the reward (podvig) of
theosis through the holy mysteries and the blessed
virtues. And in this manner he gave man the strength to
become "a perfect man, in the measure of the fullness of
Christ" (Eph. 4: 13), to achieve, that is, the Divine desti-
ny, to voluntarily become God-man by grace.
The fall of the pope is a consequence of the desire to
substitute man for the God-man.
5. According to the mystical interpreter Saint John of
Damascus, in the human world the God-man, Christ, is
"the only thing new under the sun." Indeed, this
eternal news applies not only to His Theanthropic
Presence but also to His Theanthropic Work and His
Theanthropic Body, the Church. And man also is always
new, eternally new, ("a new creation") in his theanthro-
pic newness, in all his theanthropic experiences on the
road to salvation, to sanctification, to transfiguration, to
theosis, to becoming like the God-man. In this terrestrial
world everything ages and everything dies. Only the
person who has embodied himself in the God-man and
is becoming like the God-man (ubogocovecenii obogocove-
"Expositionof the Orthodox Faith, Footnote 3, P.G. 94, Col. 984.Reflectionson the Infallibility of European Man 107
ceni), who shares the body of Christ, who under the
God-man has been embodied in the Church and has
become part of the Church (ucrkvenjen i ocrkvenjen), does
not age and does not die, because he has become a
living, organic part of the holy and eternal Theanthropic
body of Christ, the Church, in which one’s humanity
develops and continuously "grows with the nurturing of
God" (Col. 2: 19)—acquiring "the fullness of humanity as
measured by the stature of the fullness of Christ" (Eph.
4:13). This means that one is growing and developing
continuously and without limit toward unity with God
in the Divine infinity with which the Thrice-brilliant
Lord endowed humanity when he created man in the
image and likeness of God.
The God-man Christ is so extraordinarily new and
unique that in reality the "Truth" came from Him (John
1: 17), and through Him remained in our human world.
Before Him and without Him—now and forever—Truth
does not exist. Verily, it does not exist because only the
Hypostasis of the God-man is Truth. "I am the Truth"
(John 14: 6). And since man does not exist independent-
ly of the God-man there can be no truth for him inde-
pendently of the God-man.
All is new in the God-man and because of Him. He
Himself is first, followed by salvation, the teaching
regarding salvation, and the means of salvation. And the
God-man’s message for the human race is uniquely
new: Let us separate sin from the sinner, let us hate sin
but love the sinner, let us kill sin yet save the sinner. Do
. not equate the sinner with the sin. Do not put the sinner
to death because of sin. Save him from sin! A striking
example of this is the woman found entangled in
adultery. The all-merciful Savior separated her sin from
her existence in the image and likeness of God. He108 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
condemned the sin but had mercy on the sinner. "I do
not condemn; go and sin no more" (John 8: 11). This is
the Orthodox method of recovery, established as dogma,
in the task of saving the sinner from sin. This method of
Holy Tradition, developed in accordance with the
wisdom of God and established in the Orthodox Church
by the Holy Fathers, has been expressed in accordance
with the Spirit of God by St. Symeon the New Theolo-
gian: "The good is not good when no good results."
In the light of this sacred, evangelical Orthodox
Tradition it is an atrocity, contrary to the Gospel and
anti-Christ, to kill a sinner because he has sinned.
Accordingly, there is no "holy inquisition" that can be
proclaimed as holy. In the final analysis all humanisms
kill the sinner because of sin, exterminating the sinner
along with the sin. They do not want the God-man, who
is the only salvation of man from sin, from death, and
from the devil. He who is not for the God-man is, as a
consequence, against man, is in this way an assassin of
man, and furthermore, is also committing suicide. He
leaves man under the total domination by sin, of death
and of the devil, from which only the God-man is able
to save him, for no one else beneath the heavens can. By
using the methods of sinners himself, the humanist
inevitably commits suicide. He murders his own soul,
he gives himself up to hell, to an eternal association
with the devil, the man-killer from time immemorial.
(John 8: 44).
6. What is it that the God-man gives to man which no
one else is capable of giving? It is victory over death,
‘Footnote 4, Homilies 18 and 68 Zogaraios edition, Smyrna 1886,
pp. 105 and 364.Reflectionson the Infallibility of European Man 109
Over sin, and over the devil, Eternal Life, Eternal Truth,
Eternal Justice, Eternal Virtue, Eternal Love, Eternal Joy:
the entire fullness of the Godhead and of Divine Perfec-
tion. As the Apostle tells us: the God-man gives to men
"those things which God has prepared for those who
love Him, which no eye has seen, which no ear has
heard, and which have not entered the heart of man" (1
Corne:79);
In fact only He, the wondrous God-man, is the "one
thing that is needed" (cf. Luke 10: 42) by man in all his
worlds and in his every life. Therefore, only the God-
man is justified in asking of us that which no one else
has ever dared ask: that we love Him more than we
love parents, siblings, children, friends, the earth, the
angels, anyone and everyone in all the worlds, visible
and invisible (Matth. 10: 37-39; Luke 14: 26, Rom. 8:
31-39).
7. The Second Vatican Council resulted in the rebirth
of all European humanisms, the rebirth of cadavers.
Since Christ the God-man is present in this terrestrial
world, each and every humanism is a cadaver. Matters
reached this stage because the Council persisted in
maintaining the dogma concerning the infallibility of the
pope (= the man). Examined from the vantage point of
the eternally living God-man, the historic Lord Jesus, all
humanisms resemble criminal utopias to a greater or
lesser extent. In the name of man they find various ways
to murder man, to exterminate him as a spiritual and
physical entity. All the humanisms arrive at one tragic,
irrational result: they strain at a gnat and they swallow
a camel. In the matter of papal infallibility, the notion
has been elevated to dogma. And it is a horror, a horror
in the extreme. Why? It is because the very dogma110 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
regarding the infallibility of man is nothing other than
the shuddering funeral of every humanism, from the
ideas that the Vatican has established as dogma to the
satanic humanism of Sartre. In the humanistic pantheon
of Europe all the gods are dead, with European Zeus at
the forefront. Dead, until such time as there arises in
their withered hearts a complete, self-denying repen-
tance, accompanied by the lightning and thunder of
Golgotha,; with its resurrectional earthquakes and
transformations, and with its richly yielding storms and
ascensions. And then? Then, their doxologies to the
living, eternal, wondrous God-man, the only lover of
mankind in all the worlds, will be unending.
8. What is at the core of the dogma regarding papal
(= man’s) infallibility? It is the de-theanthropization of
man. This is sought by all humanisms, even the reli-
gious ones. All return man to idolatry, to polytheism, to
the dual death, spiritual as well as physical. Distancing
itself from the God-man, every humanism by degrees
becomes nihilism. This reveals the simultaneous bank-
ruptcy of all humanisms, led by that of the papacy
which, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily,
is the father of all European humanisms. The resulting
bankruptcy, the disastrous bankruptcy of the papacy,
lies in the dogma of papal infallibility. It is precisely this
dogma of nihilism that is uppermost. For this, European
man in a doctrinaire and determined manner has pro-
claimed the dogma of self-sufficiency, and in this way
has asserted that the God-man is not needed. There is
no place for Him on earth. He has been completely re-
placed by the representative of Christ—Vicarius Christi.
Truly, this is the dogma by which all European human-Reflectionson the Infallibility of European Man Ld
isms live, which they follow, and which they persistent-
ly proclaim.
All European humanisms in their essence are nothing
other than an unending revolution against the God-man
Christ. Using all possible methods they achieve Umwert-
ung aller Werte (the overthrow of all values). The God-
man is everywhere replaced by man. On all European
thrones European humanists are seated. As a result
there is not a single Vicarius Christi but innumerable
ones in various costumes. In the final analysis the
dogma concerning infallibility of the pope has led to the
proclamation of the general infallibility of man. And
from this followed the innumerable popes of all Europe-
an cultures, of the Vatican, and of Protestantism. Among
them, however, there are no essential differences be-
cause, in the thinking of Khomiakov the visionary of
Truth, the papacy is the first Protestantism.
9. Infallibility is a natural theanthropic characteristic
and a natural theanthropic function of the church which
is the theanthropic Body of Christ, and whose eternal
leader is the Truth, the All-Encompassing Truth, the
Second Hypostasis of the All-Holy Trinity, our Lord
Jesus Christ the God-man. With respect to the dogma
concerning papal infallibility, as a practical matter the
pope has been proclaimed to be the Church, and the
pope—a man—has usurped the place of the God-man.
That is the ultimate triumph of humanism and simulta-
neously "the second death" (Rev. 20: 14, 21: 8) of the
papacy, and through it and after it the death of every
humanism. However, the dogma of papal infallibility is
not only a heresy but the greatest heresy against the
True Church of Christ, which has existed in our terres-
trial world as a theanthropic body ever since the appear-112 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
ance of the God-man. No other heresy has revolted so
violently and so completely against the God-man Christ
and His Church.as has the papacy with the dogma of
the pope-man’s infallibility. There is no doubt about it.
This dogma is the heresy of heresies, a revolt without
precedent against the God-man Christ on this earth, a
new betrayal of Christ, a new crucifixion of the Lord,
this time not on wood but on the golden cross of papal
humanism. And these things are hell, damnation for the
wretched earthly being called man.
10. Is there a way out of these innumerable human-
istic hells? Is there resurrection from these innumerable
European graves? Is there a remedy for those innumera-
ble deadly sicknesses? There is, there certainly is:
repentance. That is the eternal message of the Gospel of
the God-Man: "Repentance so that you may know the
truth" (2 Tim. 2: 25). Otherwise it is not possible for
anyone to believe in the all-saving Gospel of the God-
man. "Repent and believe in the Gospel" (Mark 1: 15).
Repentance before the God-Man is the only medicine for
sin, the unique medicine for all sins, even for the
greatest of sins. There is no doubt. Repentance is the
medicine even for this, the greatest sin of the papacy,
centered in the arrogant dogma of papal infallibility, as
it is also for every one of its sins, every humanism
individually, and all humanisms together. Yes, yes, yes.
From his beloved great sin of infallibility, European
"infallible" man, European humanistic man, can only be
saved through whole-hearted and _all-transforming
repentance before the wondrous, all-merciful, all-virtuo-
us Lord Jesus Christ the God-man, the only Savior of
the human race from all sins, from each evil, from each
hell, from each devil, from each humanistic rationalism,Reflectionson the Infallibility of European Man tS
from any of the sins which the human imagination is
able to conceive.
For these reasons all the holy God-bearing and God-
minded Fathers, including those of the seven holy
Oecumenical Synods, refer all problems in the Church
of Christ to the problem of the Personhood of Christ the
God-man, until that which is the greatest, the only, the
most precious value to all human beings is found, not
on this earth or on any other, but in the dominion of
God. The Christological problem is their entire problem,
fully and completely. For them Christ the God-man is
the unique value of the Church of Christ in all the
worlds. Their unending and eternal message is: Give up
everything for Christ; do not give Christ up for any-
thing! And around this holy signal echoes their ever-res-
ounding message of joy: Not humanism but God-huma-
nism! Not man but the God-man! Christ before all and
above all!
11. How does an Orthodox Christian feel in the
presence of Christ the God-man? He feels totally and
completely sinful. That is his feeling, his attitude, his
manner, his mindset, his speech, his conscience, his
confession, his entire being. That feeling of total person-
al sinfulness in the presence of the Most Sweet Lord is
the soul of his soul and the heart of his heart. Briefly
examine the prayers of repentance, the odes, the hymns,
the stichera in the Parakletike of Monday and even of
Tuesday, and you will immediately verify that this
sentiment constitutes a sacred duty and a prayerful
reality for every Orthodox Christian without exception.
This path has been explored by our immortal teachers,
the Holy Fathers, who continuously direct us. Let us
remember at least two of them, St. John of Damascus114 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
and St. Symeon the New Theologian. Their saintliness is
cherubic beyond any doubt. Their prayer is assuredly
seraphic. Nevertheless, they themselves express a feeling
and consciousness of utter personal sinfulness and
simultaneously a deeply-felt attitude of repentance. That
is the existential contradiction (antinomy) in our Ortho-
dox, evangelical, apostolic faith, and our humility in this
faith.
The infallible man and his opposite, the utterly sinful
man, humility on the one hand and pride on the other.
The incomparable nightingale of the Gospel of the God-
man, St. John Chrysostom evangelizes: "The foundation
of every one of our philosophies is humility."’ Humility
is the foundation of our philosophy concerning life and
the world, concerning time and eternity, concerning the
God-man and the Church. On the one hand, the founda-
tion of every humanism, including even that which has
been established as dogma, is pride, faith in man’s
reasoning, in his mind, and in his rationality. Pride
transformed even the radiant Lucifer into a devil. Pride
is the incurable mental sickness of the devil. Within it
are found and from it emanate all the other diabolical
evils. On the other hand, humility teaches us to commit
our hope to and to have the utmost trust in the holy,
catholic, theanthropic mind of the Church, "the mind of
Christ." "We have the mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2: 16). We
in the theanthropic body of Christ, the Orthodox
Church, have Christ the God-man as everything: head,
body, life, truth, love, righteousness, time, and eternity,
and also through faith in Him and in our life in Him
(Eph. 4:11-21). This is because "all things were created
PG, 51, 342.Reflectionson the Infallibility of European Man 115
through him and for him, he is before all things, and in
him all things hold together. He is the head of the body
of the church, that in everything he might be preemi-
nent" (Col. 1: 16-18). He the God-man and not a man,
whomsoever he may be.
12. I humbly ask forgiveness because I, a worthless
sinner, truly a worthless sinner, dared to stammer these
few words regarding the Second Vatican Council. It was
done in obedience. It was requested of me, the insignifi-
cant and worthless sinner. I carried out my task in
obedience, honestly, conscientiously, with a heavy heart,
with many sighs, and relying on the support of the first
and foremost of the Holy Apostles, St. Peter (cf. 1 Peter
3: 15). If any reader of these reflections feels injured, I
beg forgiveness. It is because of my sinfulness that I
have been unable to better express the truth that flows
from the Eternal Truth. And I further plead that you
beseech the Sweet Lord Jesus, who has compassion and
is ever compassionate toward every repentant sinner, to
forgive me the many sins of my youth as well as my
more recent sins. For I believe, with all my heart I
believe, that the prayer of a righteous person has
enormous value (James 5: 16), even in the case of a
worthless sinner as I am in all my being.

Translator’s Note: Obviously, as the author uses them,
"Europe" and "European" are not simply geographic
terms, but refer to a way of life that has developed in
Christian Europe, which today is advocated as the
regulator par excellence of matters of the world and of
the life of man in general. This is the source of what the116 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
author identifies as "European humanism" and "Ecume-
nism." In the contemporary church Ecumenism is
partially accepted and various aspects of this position
have penetrated into and are applied to all aspects of
human life, giving it ecumenical or universal characteris-
tics. Only one who is able to recognize the frightful
dimensions of this phenomenon and its results, and who

thought exhibited by the author toward "European

OF SAINT ISAAC THE SYRIAN’
Introduction
L. European philosophy man always appears to a
greater or lesser extent as a fragmented being. Nowhere
is he seen as whole, nowhere is he seen as complete and
integrated but always as broken and fragmented. There
is no philosophical system in which man is not broken
up into parts that would defeat the attempt of any
thinker to put them together into a single whole. On one
hand, realism brings man down to the level of the
senses, and then through the senses to things, to matter,
so that a man is no longer his own master but scattered
among things. On the other hand, rationalism separates
man and his understanding, seeing the latter as the chief
fount of truth and the highest measure of all that is, at-
tributing all worth to it, making it an absolute and
idolizing it, while at the same time belittling the other
eile andSaihia ECVE f of man.

ism and all such monistic systems, mney regard the
world and man as a mass of contradictory opposites
which can never be brought to a single, logical unity.
All of these philosophical systems have the same result:
a superficial, phenomenalist understanding both of man
and of the world.
The man of phenomenalist philosophy — a philos-
ophy that is always relativist as well — is man without
a central focal point. Where does the world stand? And
where does man? What is the foundation of the intellect
and of knowledge? Man tries to explain himself in terms
of things, but with a total lack of success, for by ex-
plaining himself in terms of things, man in the end is
reduced to a thing himself, is matter. However much he
"possess vane By attempting to anlar man by man,
philosophy achieves a bizarre result: it presents a mirror
image of a mirror image. In the last analysis, such
philosophy, whatever its path, is centered on matter and
on man. And one thing follows from all this: the impos-
sibility of any true knowledge of man or of the world.
This result compels the philosophical spirit of man to
make conjectures that transcend both man and matter.
Through idealism he takes a leap into the supernatural.
But this leap in turn leads to scepticism, for philosophi-
cal idealism regards man as a meta-empirical reality that
can neither be described nor proven.
Man, as understood in relativist philosophy, is subject
to a tragic destiny, for he has demonstrated that truth
transcends both man and matter. There is an unbridge-The Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac The Syrian 119
able gulf between man and truth. Man is on one side of
this gulf and can find no way of getting to the other
where transcendent Truth is to be found. But the power
of Truth, from the other side, responds to the powerless-
ness of man on this sid .Transcendent Truth crosses the
, arrives on ¢ it and reveals itself —
Finks elf —in the person of Christ, the God-man. In Him
transcendent Truth becomes immanent in man. The
God-man reveals the truth in and through Himself. He
reveals it, not through thought or reason, but by the life
that is His. He not only has the truth, He is Himself the
Truth. In Him Being and Truth are one. Therefore, He,
in His person, not only defines truth but shows the way
to it: he who abides in Him will know the truth, and the
truth will make him free (cf. John 8: 32) from sin,
falsehood, and death.
In the person of the God-man, God and man are
indissolubly united. Man’s understanding is not over-
thrown, but is renewed, purified, and sanctified. It is
deepened and divinized and made capable of grasping
the truths of life in the light of God-made-man. In the
God-man, absolute Truth has in its entirety been given
in a real and personal way. This is why He alone,
among those born on earth, both has integral knowledge
of the truth and can hand it on. The man who desires to”
know the truth has only to be made one with th
God-man, to become one one flesh with Him, to become ay
member of his divine and human Body, the Church
(Eph. 5: 30; 3: 6). Becoming such, a man acquires "the
mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2: 16), thinking, living, feeling in
Christ, and thus coming to an integral knowledge of the
Truth.
For the man in Christ, the antinomies of the mind are
not irreconcilable opposites; they are simply ruptures120 OREO FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
caused by the upheaval of original sin in man. Uniting
himself to Christ, man feels in himself a coming-together
of fragmented parts, a healing of the intellect, awhole-
ness and integration that make him capable of integrat-
ed understanding.

processof the healingand purificationof man’s organs

The sickness of the organs of understanding
Tee character of aman’s knowledge depends on the
disposition, nature, and condition of his organs of
understanding. At all levels knowledge depends intrinsi-
cally on the means of understanding. Man does not
make truth; the act of understanding is an act of making
one’s own a truth which is already objectively given.
This integration has an organic character, not unlike that
of the grafting of a slip onto a vine, or its life in andThe Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac The Syrian 121
from thevine (cf. John 15: 1-6). Understanding is, then,
a fruit on thetreeofthehuman person. Asisthetree,
soareitsfruits, asaretheorgans ofunderstanding, so
istheknowledge they engender.
Analyzing man by his empirical gifts, St. Isaac the
Syrian finds that his organs of understanding are sick.
"Evil is a sickness of soul," whence all the organs of
understanding are made sick.' Evil has its perceptions,
the passions, and "the passions are illnesses of the soul.’
Evil and the passions are not natural to the soul; they
are accidents, adventitious, and intrusive, an unnatural
addition to the soul.
What are the passions in themselves? They are "a
certain hardness or insensitivity of being."” Their causes
are to be found in the things of life themselves.° The
passions are the desire for wealth and amassing of
goods, for ease and bodily comfort; they are thirst for
honor and the exercise of power; they are luxury and
frivolity; they are the desire for glory from men and fear
for one’s own body.’ All these passions have one
common name — "the world."®"The world means carnal
conduct and a carnal mind.” The passions are the
attacks of the world on man by means of the things of
the world. Divine grace is the only power capable of
repulsing them."*When the passions make their home in
man, they uproot his soul." They confuse the mind,
filling it with fantastic forms, images, and desires,” so
that his thoughts are disturbed and filled with fantasy.
"The world is a prostitute,’ which, by means of its

soul-destroying desires, beguiles the soul, undermines
its virtues, and destroys its God-given purity. Then, the
soul, having itself. become impure and a prostitute, gives
birth to impure knowledge.
A feeble soul, a diseased intellect, aweakened heart
and will — in brief, sick organs of understanding — can
only engender, fashion, and produce sick thoughts, sick
feelings, sick desires, and sick knowledge.

are the source of the virtues.” He therefore expressly

advocates a love of oppression and sorrow, so that by
them a man may be freed from the things of this world
and have a mind that is detached from the world’s
confusion.” For man must first free himself from the
material world in order to be born of God. Such is the
economy of grace; such, too, is the economy of knowl-
edge.
If a man resolves to treat and heal his soul, he must
first apply himself to a careful examination of his whole
being. He must learn to distinguish good from evil, the
things of God from those of the devil, for "discernment
is the greatest of the virtues."” The acquisition of the
virtues is a progressive and organic process: one virtue
follows another.” One depends on the other; one is born
of the other: "Every virtue is the mother of the next."
Among the virtues there is not only an ontological
order, but also a chronological one. The first among
them is faith.
Faith
At is by the ascesis of faith that the treatment and
ireof a soul which is sick with the passions is begun.
Once faith begins to live in a man, the passions begin to
be uprooted from his soul. But “until the soul becomes
intoxicated with faith in God, until it comes to feel
faith’s power," it can neither be healed of the passions
nor overcome the material world.” There is both a nega-

tive side to the ascesis of faith, freedom from sinful
matter, and a positive side, oneness with God.”
The soul, which was dispersed by the senses among
the things of this world, is brought back to itself by the
ascesis of faith, by fasting from material things and by
devoting itself to a constant remembrance of God. This
is the foundation of all good things.” Freedom from
enslavement to sinful matter is essential for advance-
ment in the spiritual life.” The beginning of this new
way of life is found in the concentration of one’s
thoughts on God, in incessant pondering on the words
of God, and in a life of poverty.”
Through faith the mind, which was previously
dispersed among the passions, is concentrated, freed
from sensuality, and endowed with peace and humility
of thought.” When it lives by the senses in a sensual
world, the mind is sick.*’With the help of faith, howev-
er, the mind is delivered from the prison of this world,
where it has been stifled by sin, and enters into the new
age, where it breathes in a wondrous new air.” "The
sleep of the mind” is as dangerous as death, and it is
therefore essential to rouse the mind by faith to the
performance of spiritual works,* by which man will
overcome himself and drive out the passions.™ "Drive
out self, and the enemy will be driven from your side."®
In the ascesis of faith, man is asked to act according
to a paradox that denies understanding: "Be dead in
your life, and you will live after death."* By faith the
mind is healed and acquires wisdom. The soul becomes

wise when it stops "consortingshamelesslywith promis-
cuous thoughts.” "Loveof the body is a sign of unbe-
lief." Faith freesthe intellect from the categories of the
senses and sobers it by means of fasting, by pondering -
on God” and by vigils. .
Intemperance and a full stomach cloud the mind,’
distract it, and disperse it among fantasies and passions.
The knowledge of God cannot be found in a body that
loves pleasure.” It is from the seed of fasting that the
blade of a healthy understanding grows — and it is
from salety that debauchery comes, and impurity from
excess.”
The thoughts and desires of the flesh are like a
restless flame in a man, and the way to healing is to
plunge the intellect into the ocean of the mysteries of
Holy Scripture.” Unless it is freed from earthly posses-
sions, the soul cannot be freed from disturbing thoughts,
nor feel peace of mind without dying to the senses.*
The passions darken the thoughts and blind the mind.”
Troubled, chaotic thoughts arise from an abuse of the
stomach.”
Shame and the fear of God steady the tumult of the
mind; the lack of this shame and this fear disturb the
balance of the understanding, making it fickle and
unstable.* The mind is only on a firm foundation if it
keeps the Lord’s commandments” and is ready to
endure suffering and affliction.” If it is enslaved by the
things of life, it is darkened.” Collecting himself through

prayerful silence cleanses his mind® and overcomes the
passions.™ The soul is restored to health by silence. It is
therefore necessary to train oneself to silence — and this
is a labor that brings sweetness to the heart.” It is
through silence that aman reaches peace from unwant-
ed thoughts.”
Faith brings peace to the intellect and, in bringing it,
uproots rebellious thoughts. Sin is the source of restless-
ness and strife in the thoughts and is also the source of
man’s struggle against heaven and with other men. "Be
at peace with yourself, and you will bring peace to
heaven and to earth."” Until faith appears, the intellect
is dispersed among the things of this world; it is by
faith that this fragmentation of the intellect is over-
come.® The wandering of the thoughts is provoked by
the demon of harlotry,” as is the wandering of the eyes
by the spirit of uncleanness.™

struggle with the passions, for faith is the light of the
mind that drives away the darkness of the passions and
the strength of the intellect that banishes sickness from
the soul.®
Faith bears within itself not only its own principle and
substance, but the principle and substance of all the
other virtues — developing as they do one from the
other and encircling one another like the annual rings of
a tree. If faith can be said to have a language, that lan-
guage is prayer.
Prayer
I. is by the ascesis of faith that aman conquers ego-
tism, steps beyond the bounds of self, and enters into a
new, transcendent reality which also transcends
subjectivity. In this new reality new laws rule; what is
old has passed away and all is made new. Plunged into
the unknown depths of this new reality, the ascetic of
faith is led and guided by prayer; he feels, thinks, and’
lives by prayer:
_ Tracing this path of faith in the intellect of man, St.
Isaac notes that the intellect is guarded and guided by
prayer, every good thought being transformed by prayer
into a pondering on God.” But prayer is also a hard
struggle, calling the whole person into action. Man
crucifies himself in prayer, crucifying the passions and
sinful thoughts that cling to his soul. “Prayer is the
slaying of the carnal thoughts of man’s fleshy life."”
66. Log. 12, p. 49; 67. Log. 35, p. 155; 68. id. p. 151; 69. Log. 69,
p- 272.128 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Patient perseverance in prayer is for man a very hard
ascesis, that of the denial of self.”” This is fundamental
to the work of salvation. Prayer is the fount of salvation,
and it is by prayer that all the other virtues — and all
good things — are acquired.” This is why a man of
prayer is assailed by monstrous temptations from which
he is protected and saved only by prayer.
The surest guardian of the intellect is prayer.” It
drives away the clouds of the passions and illumines the
intellect,” bringing wisdom to the mind.” Unceasing
abiding in prayer is a true sign of perfection.”
Spiritual prayer turns into ecstasy in which are
revealed the mysteries of the Holy Trinity, and the
intellect enters that sphere of holy unknowing that is
greater than knowledge.”
Begun thus by faith, the healing of the organs of
understanding is continued by prayer. The bounds of
human personality are pushed wider and wider, self-
-centeredness being progressively replaced by God-cen-
teredness.
Love

faith. qe canthes. are of one substance, and are thus

born of one another. Love for God is a sign that the new
- reality into which a man is led by faith and prayer is far
greater than that which has gone before. Love for God
and man is the work of prayer and faith; a true love for
man is in fact impossible without faith and prayer.

By faith man changes worlds: he moves from the
limited world to the limitless, where he lives no longer
by the laws of the senses but by the laws of prayer and
love. St. Isaac lays great emphasis on the conviction he
came to through his ascetic experience: that love for God
comes through prayer — "Love is the fruit of prayer."”
One can receive love from God through prayer and
cannot in any way acquire it without the struggle of
prayer. Since man comes to the knowledge of God
through faith and prayer, it is strictly true that "love is
born of knowledge."”
Through faith man renounces the law of egotism; he
renounces his sinful soul. Though he loves his soul, he
loathes the sin that is in it. By prayer, he strives to
replace the law of egotism with the law of God, to
replace passions with virtues, to replace human life with
divine life and thereby heal the soul of its sin. This is
why St. Isaac teaches that "the love of God lies in
self-denial of the soul."”
Impurity and sickness of soul are unnatural accre-
tions; they are no part of its created nature, for "purity
and health are the kingdom of the soul." A soul
weakened by the passions is a ready ground for the
cultivation of hatred, and "love is only acquired through
healing of the soul."”
Love is of God, "for God is love" (1 John 4: 8). "He
who acquires love puts on with it God himself."* God
has no bounds, and love is therefore boundless and
without limit,“ so that "he who loves by and in God
loves all things equally and without distinction." St.
Isaac says of such aman that he has achieved perfec-

tion. As an example of perfect love, St. Isaac quotes
the wish of the holy Abba Agathon: "to find a leper and
change bodies with him."”
In the kingdom of love the antinomies of the mind
disappear. The man who strives in love enjoys a fore-
taste of the harmony of Paradise in himself and in God’s
world around him, for he has been delivered from the
hell of self-centeredness and has entered into the
paradise of divine values and perfections. In St. Isaac’s
words: "Paradise is the love of God, in which lies the
sweetness of all blessings."*” Hell is the absence of the
love of God, and those tortured in hell are tortured by
the whiplash of love." When a man acquires perfectly
the love of God, he acquires perfection.” St. Isaac
therefore recommends: "First acquire love, which is the
original form of man’s contemplation of the Holy
Trinity."”
Freeing himself from the passions, man disengages
himself step by step from that self-absorption that
characterizes humanism. He leaves the sphere of death-
dealing anthropocentrism and enters the sphere of the
Holy Trinity. Here he receives into his soul the divine
peace, wherein the oppositions and contradictions that
arise from the categories of time and space lose their
death-dealing power, and where he can clearly perceive
his victory over sin and death.
Humility
Eien has its own thought-forms, having as it does
its own way of life. AChristian not only lives by faith

(2 Cor. 5: 7) but also thinks by faith. Faith presents a
new way of thinking, through which is effected all the
work of knowing in the believing man. Thisnew way of
rking is humility. Within the infinite reality of faith,
the intellect abases itself before the ineffable mysteries
of new life in the Holy Spirit. The pride of the intellect
gives way to humility and modesty replaces presump-
tion. The ascetic of faith protects all his thoughts
through humility, and thereby also ensures for himself
the knowledge of eternal truth.
Drawing its strength from prayer, humility goes on
growing and growing without end. St. Isaac teaches that
prayer and humility are always equally balanced, and
tha ress in Bai means progress also inhumilit
d vice versa” Humility is a power that collects the
heart within itself and prevents its dissipating itself in
proud thoughts and lustful desires. Humility is u held»
and protected by the Holy Spirit, and not only draws
man to God but also God to man.” Furthermore,
humility was the cause of the Son of God taking flesh,
that closest union of God with man: "Humility made
God a man on earth."“ Humility is "the adornment of
divinity, for the Word made flesh spoke with us
through the human body with which he had clothed
himself.'”°
Humility is a mysterious, divine power which is given
only to the saints, to those who are perfected in the
virtues, and it is given by grace. It "contains all things
within itself." By the grace of the Holy Spirit "the
mysteries are revealed to the humble,” and it is these

humble ones who are thereby perfect in wisdom.” "The
humble man is the fount of the mysteries of the new
age."” &
Humility is temperance, and "the two of them prepare
in the soul a pledge for the Holy Trinity.""" Temperance
derives from humility, and it is by humility that the
intellect is healed and made whole. "From humility flow
a meekness and recollection that is the temperance of
the senses.""! "Humility adorns the soul with tempera-
nce."
When turned towards the world, a humble man
reveals the whole of his personality through humility,
imitating in this God incarnate. "Just as the soul is un-
humble man belittles himself before all men,'™ but God
therefore glorifies him, for "where humility blossoms,
11106
there God’s glory sprouts abundantly,""” and the plant
of the soul produces an imperishable flower.

of a Christian’s life in every way. In Him is found the
most perfect realization of the mystical union of God
and man, while at the same time He reveals both God’s
work in man and man’s in God.
God and man working together is the basic indication
of Christian activity in the world. Man works with God
and God with man (cf. 1Cor. 3: 9). Working within and
around himself, the Christian gives himself entirely to
ascesis, but he does this, and is able to do it, only
through the ceaseless activity of the divine power that
is grace. For the Christian no thought, no feeling, no
action can come from the Gospel without the help of
God’s grace. Man, for his part, brings the desire, but
God gives the grace, and it is from this mutual activity,
or synergy, that Christian personality is born.
On every rung of the ladder of perfection, grace is
essential to the Christian. Aman can make no single
evangelical virtue his own without the help and
support of God’s grace, Everything in Christianity is by
‘grace and free will, for all is the common work of God
and man. St. Isaac particularly stresses this common
work of man’s will and God's grace in the whole of a
Christian’s life. Grace opens a man’s eyes to the discern-
ment of good and evil. It strengthens the sense of God
within him, opens the future to him and fills him with
mystical light.”
The more grace God gives to the man of faith, the
more He reveals to him the abysses of evil in the world
and in man. At the same time, He allows greater and
greater temptations to assail him, that he may test the
God-given power of grace and may feel and learn that
107. Log. 19, p. 72134 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
it is only by the help of grace that he can overcome the
ever more fearsome and scandalous temptations. For as
soon as grace perceives that a man’s soul is becoming
self-sufficient, making him great in his own sight, it
leaves him and lets temptations assail him until he
becomes aware of his sickness and humbly takes refuge
in God.”
By the working together of God’s grace and his own
will, a man grows in faith to perfect stature.’” This
happens by degrees, for grace enters into the soul "little
by little," being given before all else to the humble. The
greater the humility, the greater the grace, and wisdom
is contained within grace. "The humble are endowed
with wisdom by grace."""!
Grace-filled wisdom gradually reveals the mysteries
to the humble, one after the other, culminating in the
mystery of suffering. The humble know why man
suffers, for grace reveals to them the meaning of suffer-
ing. The greater the grace that a man has, the greater his
grasp of the meaning and purpose of suffering and
temptation. If he drives grace from him by sloth and
love of sin, a man drives from himself the only means
he has of finding meaning and justification for his
sufferings and temptations.

passions from his whole being and from his organs of
understanding, in this way healing them of these
death-dealing illnesses. The healing of the organs of
understanding from sin and the passions is at the same
time their purification. Especial care must be taken with
the chief organ of understanding, the intellect, for it has
a particularly important role in the realm of human
personality.
In nothing else is powerful vigilance as vital as in the
work of purifying the intellect. For this task, the ascetic
of faith must do battle with all his forces, so that with
the help of the grace-filled evangelical virtues, he may
renew and transform his intellect. St. Isaac offers us his
rich experience in this.
According to him, impurity and heaviness of the
intellect come from a satiated stomach.'”” Fasting is
therefore the chief means of purifying the intellect. The
intellect is by nature fine and delicate,’ while heaviness
is an unnatural addition introduced by sin. It is through
prayer that the intellect is refined and rendered clear.’

Transforming himself with the help of grace-filled
ascetic effort, aman acquires purity of intellect and with
this purified intellect "comes to see the mysteries of
God." "The purification of the body produces a state

that arise in the mind. The cleansing of the intellect
takes place through the revelation of the mysteries.""”

itself joy through spiritual awareness, for he becomes a
son of God and a brother of Christ."
If he overcomes the passions, a man achieves purity
of soul.’” The "darkening of the intellect" comes from
lack of compassion and from laziness.” The virtues are
"the wings of the intellect," by the help of which it rises
to heaven.'” Christ sent down the Holy Spirit upon His
apostles, and the Holy Spirit purified their intellects and
made them perfect, slaying in them the old man of the
passions and bringing the new, spiritual man to life."
Fragmented by sinful and impure thoughts, the
intellect recollects itself through prayer, silence, and the
other ascetic practices.’ When the intellect frees itself
by repentance from its close connection with the pas-
sions, at first it is like a bird that has had its wings
clipped. It strives to rise above earthly things through
prayer, but it cannot, being tied to the earth. The ability
to fly comes only after long striving in the virtues, for it
is then that it collects itself and learns to fly.”
The love of God isa power that brings the intellect to
itself.(133)The reading of hymns and psalms, pondering
on death and the hope of future life are all "things that
collect the intellect and protect it from fragmentation."
e intellect is destined to reign over the passions,” to
rule over the senses,’ and to control them.”
The purpose of all the laws and commandments of
God is purity of heart.* God took flesh to cleanse our
hearts and souls from evil and to bring them back to

their original state.” But there is a certain difference
between purity of heart and purity of intellect. St. Isaac
writes: "In what.does purity of intellect differ from
purity of heart? Purity of intellect is one thing, but
purity of heart is another. For the intellect is one of the
senses of the soul, but the heart contains the interior
senses and governs them. It is their root. And if the root
is holy, then the branches are also holy. If then, the
heart is purified, clearly all the senses are purified."
The heart acquires purity by means of many trials,
tribulations, and tears, and by the mortifying of all that
is of the world.’ Tears cleanse the heart from impuri-
ty.” To the question what is the sign by which one can
know if a man has achieved purity of heart, St. Isaac
replies: "When he sees all men as good, and no one
appears to him to be unclean or profane."
Purity of heart and intellect are acquired through
asceticism. "Asceticism is the mother of holiness." The
silent practice of bodily virtue cleanses the body of the
matter that is in it.“ However, "strenuous bodily effort
without purity of intellect is like a barren womb and
withered breasts. It cannot come near to the knowledge
of God. It wearies the body but has no concern to
uproot the passions from the intellect. Thus it profits
nothing."
The sign of purity is: to rejoice with those who rejoice
and weep with those who weep; to be in pain with the
sick and in anguish with the sinners; to rejoice with the
repentant and to participate in the agony of those who.

suffer; to criticiz ¢ no man and, in the purity of one’s
own mind, to see all men sere and holy.
The intellect cannot be cleansed nor can it be glorified
with Christ if the body does not suffer with and for
Christ; the glory of the body is "temperate submission
before God, and the glory of the intellect is the true
contemplation of God." The beauty oftemperance is
ae hieved through fasting, prayer, and tears.” Purity of
eart and intellect, the healing of the intellect and the
other organs of understanding, all this is the fruit of
long striving under grace, in asceticism. In the pure
intellect of the ascetic of faith there bubbles up that
fountain of light which pours sweetness upon the mys-
tery of life and of the world.’
The mystery of knowledge
plz healing and purification of the organs of human
knowledge are brought about by the common action of
God and man — by the grace of God and the will of
man. On the long path of purification and healing,
knowledge itself becomes purer and healthier. At every
stage of its development, knowledge depends on the
ontological structure and the ethical state of its organs.
Purified and healed by a man’s striving in the
evangelical virtues, the organs of knowledge themselves
acquire holiness and purity. A pure heart and pure
mind engender pure knowledge. The organs of knowl-

edge, when purified, healed, and turned towards God,
give a pure and healthy knowledge of God and, when
turned towards .creation, give a pure and healthy
knowledge of creation. |
According to the teachingofSt. Isaacthe Syrian,there
_aretwo sortsof knowledge: thatwhich precedes faith
“and that which is born of faith. The former is natural
knowledge and involves the discernment of good and
evil. The latter is spiritual knowledge and is "the percep-
tion of the mysteries," "the perception of what is hid-
den," "the contemplation of the invisible."
There are also two sorts of faith: the first comes
through hearing and is confirmed and proven by the
second, "the faith of contemplation," "the faith that is
based on what has been seen." In order to acquire’
spiritual knowledge, a man must first be freed from”
‘natural knowledge.’” This is the work of faith. It is by
the ascesis of faith that there comes to man that "un-
known power" that makes him capable of spiritual
knowledge. If aman allows himself to be caught in the
web of natural knowledge, it is more difficult for him to
free himself from it than to cast off iron bonds, and his
life is lived "against the edge of a sword."
When a man begins to follow the path of faith, he
must lay aside once and for all his old methods of
knowing, for faith has its own methods. Then natural
knowledge ceases and spiritual knowledge takes its
place. Natural knowledge is contrary to faith, for faith,
and all that comes from faith, is "the destruction of the.
laws of knowledge "— though not of spiritual, but of
natural knowledge.'*

in n itself "a sign of Gaceriainty TaN the truth." Faith, on
the contrary, follows a pure and simply way of thought
that is far removed from all guile and methodical
examination. These two paths lead in opposite direc-
tions. The house of faith is "childlike thoughts and
simplicity of heart," for it is said: "Glorify God in sim-
plicity of heart" (Col. 3: 22), and: "Except ye be convert-
ed and become as little children, ye shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven." (Matth. 18: 3). Natural knowl-
edge stands opposed both to simplicity of heart and
simplicity of thought. This knowledge only works
within the limits of nature, "but faith has its own path
beyond nature.”
The more a man devotes himself to the ways of natu-
ral knowledge, the more he is seized on by fear and the
less can he free himself from it. But if he follows faith,
he is immediately freed and "as a son of God, has the
power to make free use of all things." "The man who
loves this faith acts like God in the use of all created
things," for to faith is given the power "to be like God in
making a new creation." Thus it is written: "Thou
desiredst, and all things are presented before thee." (cf.
Job 23: 13 LXX) Faith can often "bring forth all things
out of nothing,” while knowledge can do nothing
"without the help of matter." Knowledge has no power
over nature, but faith has such power. Armed with faith,
men have entered into the fire and quenched the flames,
being untouched by them. Others have walked on the
waters as on dry land. All these things are "beyond
nature”; they go against the modes of natural knowledge
and reveal the vanity of such modes. Faith "moves about
above nature.” The ways of natural knowledge ruled the142 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
world for more than 5,000 years, and man was unable
to "lift his gaze from the earth and understand the
might of his Creator" until "our faith arose and deliv-
ered us from the shadows of the works of this world"
and from a fragmented mind. He who has faith "will
lack nothing," and, when he has nothing, "he possesses
all things by faith," as it is written: "All things, whatso-
ever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive"
(Matth. 21: 22); and also: "The Lord is near; be anxious
for nothing.” (Phil. 4: 6)'”
Natural laws donotexist forfaith. St. Isaac emphasiz-

This natural Proriedec to which St. Isaac refers ap-
pears in modern philosophy under three headings:
Tealism based on the senses, epistemological criticism, _
and monism. These three approaches all limit the power,
reality, force, worth, criteria, and extent of knowledge to
within the bounds of visible nature — to the extent that
these coincide with the limits of the human senses as
organs of knowledge. To step beyond the limits of
nature and to enter into the realm of the supernatural is
considered to be against nature, as something irrational
and impossible, forbidden to the followers of the three
philosophical paths in question. Directly or indirectly,
man is limited to his senses and dare not pass beyond.
them.

157. id. pp. 250, 251-2; 158. id. p. 253; 159. ibid.The Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac The Syrian 143
faith is higher than it is. This knowledge is only to be
condemned in so far as, by the different means it uses,
it turns against faith. But when this knowledge "is
joined with faith, becoming one with her, clothing itself
in her burning thoughts," when it "acquires wings of
passionlessness,”" then, using other means than natural
ones, it rises up from the earth "into the realm of its
Creator,” into the supernatural. This knowledge is then
fulfilled by faith and receives the power to "rise to the
heights," to perceive him who is beyond all perception
and to "see the brightness that is incomprehensible to
the mind and knowledge of created beings." Knowledge
is the level from which a man rises up to the heights of
faith. When he reaches these heights, he has no more
need of it, for it is written: "We know in part, but when
that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away.” (1 Cor. 13: 9-10) Faith reveals to us
now the truth of perfection, as if it were before our eyes.
It is by faith that we learn that which is beyond our
grasp — Dye faith and not by enquiry and the power of
knowledge.

There are three spiritual modes in which rowietee
rises and falls, and by which it moves and changes.
These are the body, the soul, and the spirit. Although
160. id. p. 25; 161. id. pp. 254-5.144 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
knowledge is a single whole by its nature, it changes the
way and form of its action in relation to each of these
three. "Knowledge is a gift of God to the nature of
rational beings, given to them at the beginning, at their
creation. It is naturally simple and undivided, like the
light from the sun, but in its function in relation to the
body, the soul, and the spirit it changes and becomes
divided.""”
At its lowest level, knowledge "follows the desires of
the flesh,” concerning itself with riches, vainglory, dress,
repose of body, and the search for rational wisdom. This
knowledge invents the arts and sciences and all that
adorns the body in this visible world. But in all this,
such knowledge is contrary to faith. It is known as
"mere knowledge, for it is deprived of all thought of the
divine and, by its fleshly character, brings to the mind
an irrational weakness, because in it the mind is over-
come by the body and its entire concern is for the things
of this world." It is puffed up and filled with pride, for
it refers every good work to itself and not to God. That
which the Apostle said, "knowledge puffeth up," (1 Cor.
8: 1), was obviously said of this knowledge, which is not
linked with faith and hope in God and not of true
knowledge. True, spiritual knowledge, linked with
humility, brings to perfection the soul of those who
have acquired it, as is seen in Moses, David, Isaiah,
Peter, Paul, and all those who, within the limits of
human nature, were counted worthy of this perfect
knowledge. "With them, knowledge is always immersed
in pondering things strange to this world, in divine
revelations and lofty contemplation of spiritual things
162. id. p. 255.The Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac The Syrian 145
and ineffable mysteries. In their eyes, their own souls
are but dust and ashes." Knowledge that comes of the
flesh is criticized by Christians, who see it as opposed
not only to faith but to every act of virtue.'!®
It is not difficult to see that in thi an
degree of knowledge of which St. Isaacspea
cluded virtually the whole of European philosophy,
from naive realism to idealism — and all science from
the atomism of Democrats to Einstein’srelativity.
From the first and lowest degree of knowledge, man
moves on to the second, when he begins both in body
and soul to practice the virtues: fasting, prayer, alms-
giving, the reading of Holy Scripture, the struggle with
the passions, and so forth. Every good work, every
goodly disposition of the soul in this second degree of
knowledge, is begun and performed by the Holy Spirit
through the working of this particular knowledge. The
heart is shown the paths that lead to faith, even though
this knowledge remains "bodily and composite."
The third degree of knowledge is that of perfection.
"When knowledge rises up above the earth and the care
for earthly things and begins to examine its own interior
and hidden thoughts, scorning that from which the evil
of the passions springs and rising up to follow the way
of faith in concern for the life to come. . .and in the
seeking out of hidden mysteries — then faith takes this
knowledge into itself and absorbs it, returning and
giving birth to it from the beginning, so as to become
itself ’from the beginning,’ so as to become itself wholly
spirit." Then it can "take wing and fly to the realm of
incorporeal spirits and plumb the depths of the fathom-
163. Log. 63, pp. 256-258; 164. Log. 64, p. 258.146 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
less ocean, pondering on the divine and wondrous
things that govern the nature of spiritual and physical
beings and penetrating the spiritual mysteries that can
only be grasped by a simple and supple mind. Then the
inner senses awaken to the work of the spirit in those
things that belong to that other realm, immortal and
incorruptible. This knowledge has, in a hidden way,
here in this world, received already spiritual resurrec-
tion so as to bear true witness to the renewal of all
things.""©
These, according to St. Isaac, are the three degrees of
knowledge with which the whole of man’s life is linked
in body, soul, and spirit. From the moment that he
"begins to discern between good and evil to the moment
of his leaving this world," the soul’s knowledge is
composed of one or all of these three degrees.’
The first degree of knowledge "cools the soul’s ardor
for endeavors on God’s path." The second "rekindles it
for the swift path that leads to faith.” The third is a "rest
from toil," when the mind "feasts on the mysteries of the
life to come." "But, as nature cannot as yet wholly rise
to the level of deathlessness and overcome the weight of
the flesh and perfect itself in spiritual knowledge, not
even this third degree of knowledge is able to move
towards total perfection, so as to live in the world of
death and yet leave behind completely fleshly nature."
While a man is in the flesh, therefore, he passes from
one degree of knowledge to another. He has the help of
grace, but is hindered by the demons, "for he is not
totally free in this imperfect world." Every work of
knowledge consists in “effort and constant practice," but
165. Log. 65, pp. 259-60; 166. id. p- 260.The Theory of Knowledgeof Saint Isaac The Syrian 147
the work of faith "does not consist in acts," but in
spiritual thoughts and in purity of soul, and this is
above the senses. For faith is subtler than knowledge, as
knowledge is subtler than the senses. All the saints who
attained to such a life “abide by faith in the delights of
a life above nature." This faith is born in the soul
through the light of grace which, "by the testimony of
the mind, sustains the heart that it may not be uncertain
in hope — in a hope that is far removed from all
presumption." This faith has "spiritual eyes" which
perceive "the mysteries hidden in the soul, hidden riches
that are concealed from the eyes of sons of the flesh" but
are revealed by the Holy Spirit, who is received by the
disciples of Christ (cf.John 14: 15-17). The Holy Spirit is
"the holy power" that abides within a man of Christ,
preserving and defending his soul and body from evil.
This invisible power is perceived with the eyes of faith
by those whose minds are enlightened and sanctified. It
is known to the saints "through experience.""”
To explain yet more clearly the mystery of knowl-
edge, St. Isaac presents further definitions of both
knowledge and faith. "The knowledge that is concerned
with the visible and sensual is called natural; the
knowledge that is concerned with the spiritual and
incorporeal is called spiritual, for it receives its percep-
tion through the spirit, and not through the senses. The
knowledge that comes by divine power, however, is
known as supernatural. It is unknowable and is higher
than knowledge." "The soul does not receive this con-
templation from the matter that is outside it,” as is the
case with the first two kinds of knowledge, "but it
167. id. pp. 260-62.148 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
comes unexpectedly by itself as an immaterial gift
contained within itself, according to the words of Christ:
"The kingdom of God is within you." (Luke 17: 21).
There is no point awaiting its appearance in some
outward form, for it does not come "with observation."
(Lukes17:720)s:
The first knowledge comes "from continual study and
the desire to learn. The second comes from a proper
way of life and a clearly held faith. The third comes
from faith alone, for in it knowledge is done away,
activity ceases, and the senses become superfluous."
For the mysteries of the Spirit, "which are beyond
knowledge and are not apprehended either by the
bodily senses nor the rational powers of the mind, God
has given us a faith by which we know only that these
mysteries exist." The Savior calls the coming of the
Comforter "the gifts of the revelation of the mysteries of
the Spirit,” (cf. John 14: 16, 26) and it is therefore seen
that the perfection of spiritual knowledge consists "in
the receiving of the Spirit, as did the apostles.” "Faith is
the gateway to the mysteries. As bodily eyes see materi-
al things, so faith looks with spiritual eyes on that which
is hidden." When a man passes through the gate of faith,
God leads him into "the spiritual mysteries and opens
the sea of faith to his understanding."
All the virtues have a role to play in this spiritual
knowledge, for it is the fruit of the practice of the
virtues.” Faith "engenders the fear of God," and from
this fear of God follow repentance and the practice of
the virtues, which itself gives birth to spiritual knowl-
edge.’ This knowledge, "coming from long experience
168. Log. 66, pp. 262-3; 169. Log. 72, p. 281; 170. Log. 44, p. 183;
171. Log. 18, p. 65.The Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac The Syrian 149
and practice of the virtues, is pleasant" and gives a man
great power.” The first and chief basis of spiritual
knowledge is a healthy soul, a healthy organ of knowl-
edge. "Knowledge is the fruit of a healthy soul," while
a healthy soul is the result of long practice of the
evangelical virtues.” The "healthy of soul" are the
perfect, and it is to them that knowledge is given.”
It is very difficult, and often impossible, to express in
words the mystery and nature of knowledge. In the
realm of human thought, there is no ready definition
that can explain it completely. St. Isaac therefore gives
many different definitions of knowledge. He is con-
tinually exercised in this matter, and the problem stands
like a burning question mark before the eyes of this holy
ascetic. The saint presents answers from his rich and
blessed experience, achieved through long and hard
ascesis. But the most profound, and to my mind the
most exhaustive answer that man can give to this
question is that given by St. Isaac in the form of a
dialogue:
"Question: What is knowledge?
"Answer: The perception of eternal life.
"Question: And what is eternal life?
"Answer: To perceive all things in God. For love
comes through understanding, and the knowledge of
God is ruler over all desires. To the heart that receives
this knowledge every delight that exists on earth is
superfluous, for there is nothing that can compare with
the delight of the knowledge of God."!”
Knowledge is therefore victory over death, the linking
of this life with immortal life and the uniting of man
172. Log. 48, p. 198; 173. Log. 38, p. 164; 174. Log. 44, p. 185; 175.
Log. 38, p. 164.150 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
with God. The very act of knowledge touches on the
immortal, for it is by knowledge that man passes
beyond the limits of the subjective and enters the realm
of the trans-subjective. And when the trans-subjective
object is God, then the mystery of knowledge becomes
the mystery of mysteries and the enigma of enigmas.
Such knowledge is a mystical fabric woven on the loom
of the soul by the man who is united with God.
For human knowledge the most vital problem is that
of truth. Knowledge bears within itself an irresistible
pull towards the infinite mystery, and this hunger for
truth that is instinctive to human knowledge is never
satisfied until eternal and absolute Truth itself becomes
the substance of human knowledge — until knowledge,
in its own self-perception, acquires the perception of
God, and in its own self-knowledge comes to the knowl-
edge of God. But this is given to man only by Christ,
the God-Man, he who is the only incarnation and
personification of eternal truth in the world of human
realities. When a man has received the God-Man into
himself, as the soul of his soul and the life of his life,
then that man is constantly filled with the knowledge of
eternal truth.
What is truth? St. Isaac answers thus: "Truth is the
perception of things that is given by God." 7° In other
e perception of God is truth. If this perception
exists in a man, he both has and knows the truth. If he
does not have this perception, then truth does not exist
for him. Such a man may always be seeking truth, but
he will never find it until he comes to the perception of
God, in which lie both the perception and knowledge of
truth.
176. Log.697p.272.The Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac The Syrian 151
It is the man who restores and transforms his organs
of knowledge by the practice of the virtues that comes
to the perception and knowledge of the truth. For him
faith and knowledge, and all that goes with them, are
one indivisible and organic whole. They fulfill and are
fulfilled by one another, and each confirms and supports
the other. "The light of the mind gives birth to faith,"
says St. Isaac, "and faith gives birth to the consolation of
hope, while hope fortifies the heart. Faith is the enlight-
enment of the understanding. When the understanding
is darkened, then faith hides itself and fear holds sway,
cutting off hope. Faith, which bathes the understanding
in light, frees man from pride and doubt, and is known
as ‘the knowledge and manifestation of the truth.’""”
Holy knowledge comes from a holy life, but pride
darkens that holy knowledge.'* The light of truth
increases and decreases according to a man’s way of
life.'” Terrible temptations fall upon those who seek to’
live a spiritual life. The ascetic of faith must therefore
pass through great sufferings and misfortunes in order
to come to knowledge of the truth.’
A troubled mind and chaotic thoughts are the fruit of
a disordered life, and these darken the soul.’*' When the
passions are driven from the soul with the help of the
virtues, when "the curtain of the passions is drawn back
from the eyes of the mind," then the intellect can
perceive the glory of the other world.'” The soul grows
by means of the virtues, the mind is confirmed in the
truth and becomes unshakable, "girded for encountering

and slaying every passion.""’ Freedom from the passions
is brought about by the crucifying of both the intellect
and the flesh. This makes a man capable of contemplat-
ing God. The intellect is crucified when unclean
thoughts are driven out of it, and the body when the
passions are uprooted.™ "A body given over to pleasure
cannot be the abode of the knowledge of God.""®
True knowledge — "the revelation of the mysteries"
— is attained by means of the virtues,” and this is "the
knowledge that saves.""” The chief characteristic — and
"proof" — of this knowledge is humility.” When the
intellect "abides in the realm of knowledge of the truth,"
then all questioning ceases,” and a great calm and
peace descend upon it. This peace of mind is called
"perfect health."”” When the power of the Holy Spirit
enters into the soul, then the soul "learns through the
Spirit."""
In the philosophy of St. Isaac, the problem of the na-
ture of knowledge becomes an ontological and ethical
problem which, in the last resort, is seen to be the
problem of human personality. The nature and character
of knowledge depend ontologically, morally, and gnose-
ologically on the constitution of the human person, and
especially on the constitution and state of its organs of
knowledge. In the person of the ascetic of faith, knowl-
edge, of its very nature, turns into contemplation.

(1935)The Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac The Syrian Contemplation
153
[, n the philosophy of the holy fathers, contemplation
has an ontological, ethical, and gnoseological signifi-
cance. It means prayerful concentration of the soul,
through the action of grace, on the mysteries that
surpass our understanding and are abundantly present
not only in the Holy Trinity but in the person of man
himself and in the whole of God’s creation. In contem-
plation, the person of the ascetic of faith lives above the
senses, above the categories of time and space. He has
a vivid awareness of the links that bind him to the
higher world and is nourished by revelations that
contain that which "eye has not seen nor ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of man." (1 Cor. 2: 9)
St. Isaac strives to put into words his great experience,
gained through the grace that brought him to contem-
plation. As far as human language permits the grasping
and translation of the truths of religious experience, he
seeks to explain as clearly as possible what contempla-
tion is. According to him, contemplation is the sense of
divine mysteries hidden within things and events.’”
Contemplation is found in the finest workings of the
mind and in continual pondering on God. Its abode is
unceasing prayer,” and thus it illumines the spiritual
part of the soul, the intellect.™
"Sometimes contemplation springs from prayer, silenc-
ing the prayer of the lips. Then the man at prayer
becomes through contemplation a body without breath,
outside himself. This state is known as the contempla-
192. Log. 30, p. 131; 193. id. p. 129; 194. id. p. 130.154 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
tion of prayer." "In this prayerful contemplation there
exist various degrees and a diversity of gifts," for “the
mind has not yet.passed" into that realm where there is
no longer prayer (where "prayer does not exist"), —- in
that realm there is something greater than prayer.”
By the help of a good life lived in grace, the ascetic of
faith ascends to contemplation. "To begin with he
becomes confident in God’s providence towards men
and is illumined by love towards his Creator and
marvels at his care for the rational beings that he has
made. After this there arises in him the sweetness of
God and a burning love for God in his heart, a love that
burns away the passions of both soul and body.” He is
then "drunk with the wine of divine love. . .and his
thoughts are drawn beyond themselves and his heart
led captive after God." "It seems to him at times that he
is not in the body or even in this world. Such is the
beginning of spiritual contemplation in a man — of
contemplation and at the same time of all revelation to
the mind." The mind "grows" with the help of contem-
plation and rises up to revelations "that are beyond
human nature.” In brief: in contemplation "there are
brought to man all the divine contemplations and
spiritual revelations that the saints receive in this world,
and all the gifts and revelations that nature itself is
capable of knowing in this world.""”
The virtue of understanding "humbles the soul and
purifies it from clouded thoughts, that it may not loiter
among the passions but press forward to contempla-
tion." This contemplation brings the mind close to its
primal nature and is called "immaterial contemplation.”
195. Log. 31, p. 134; 196. Log. 40, pp. 169 and 170.The Theoryof Knowledge of Saint Isaac The Syrian ies)
It is a "spiritual virtue," for "it lifts the soul up above the
earth, bringing it close to the primal contemplation of
the Spirit, introducing the mind to God and to the
contemplation of his ineffable glory,. . holding the mind
apart from this world and the perception of it.""” The
life of the Spirit is an activity in which the senses have
no part. The holy fathers wrote about this: "As soon as
the intellects of the saints have made this life their own,
material contemplation and the opacity of the flesh fall
back, and spiritual contemplation takes their place."
"The modalities of prayer" are manifold, says St. Isaac,
but they all have one aim: pure prayer. In the depths of
this pure prayer there lies a rapture that is not prayer,
for everything that can be called prayer ceases, and
there remains a contemplation in which the mind cannot
utter prayers." "Prayer is one thing, but this contempl-
ation-in-prayer is another, although one flows from the
other. Prayer is the sowing and contemplation the
gathering-in of the sheaves, in which the harvester
stands amazed at the wondrous abundance of the full
ears that have grown from the poor little grains he has
sown.” In this state of contemplation, the intellect passes
beyond its own limits and enters "that other world.”
Transformed by prayer and other ascetic practices, the
mind becomes purified and learns "to contemplate God
with divine and not human eyes."”” He who guards his
heart from the passions contemplates God at every
instant. He who maintains a constant vigilance over his
soul. . ."at every hour contemplates the Lord.” "He who
watches over his own soul at every hour will see his
heart rejoice in revelations. He who draws the contem-
197. Log. 17, p. 59; 198. id. p. 61; 199. Log. 32, p. 135. 200. Log.
35, p- 154.156 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
plation of his intellect within himself will contemplate
the dawn of the Spirit. He who recoils from the diffu-
sion of his mind will contemplate the Lord in the inner
recesses of his heart. . .Behold, heaven is within you, if
you are pure, and you will see the angels in their
radiance and, with them and within them, their Lord
himself. . .The soul of a righteous man shines more
brightly than the sun and rejoices at every hour in the
contemplation of things revealed."
When, after the strict ascesis of the Gospel, a man
finds within himself the divine center of his being —
and finds there also the center of the transcendent
divinity in this visible world — then he rises above time
and beholds himself as from eternity. He sees himself as
above time and space, deathless and eternal. At its root
true self-knowledge is also true knowledge of God, for
man carries the shortest path between himself and God
in the God-like nature of his own soul. Here lies the
shortest distance between man and God. All of man’s
paths towards God may well meet a dead end; only this
one leads surely to God in Christ. In his philosophy, St.
Isaac lays great emphasis on self-knowledge. "He who
has been counted worthy to see himself," he says, "is
greater than he who has been counted worthy to see the
angels."?
To acquire the capacity to see into his own soul, a
man must first open his heart to grace.” "To the extent
that souls are impure or darkened they can neither see
themselves nor others.” Insight will come "if a man
purifies his soul and brings it back to its primal state."?

Log. 67, p. 265.The Theory of Knowledgeof Saint Isaac The Syrian 157
"He who desires to see God within himself must strive
by constant recollection of God to purify his heart; and
thus, with the light from the eyes of his mind, he will
see God at every hour. As it is with a fish out of water,
so it is with an intellect that has turned aside from the
recollection of God. . .For the man with a pure mind,
the realm of the Spirit is within himself; the sun that
shines within him is the light of the Holy Trinity and
the air breathed by the inhabitants of this realm is the
Holy Spirit, the Comforter. . .Their life, their joy, and
their gladness is Christ, the radiance of the Father’s
light. Such a man is always gladdened at the contempla-
tion of his soul, marvelling at its beauty that is indeed
brighter than a thousand suns. This is Jerusalem, the
Kingdom of God, hidden, as the Lord says (Luke 17: 21),
within us. This realm is the cloud of God’s glory into
which only the pure of heart may enter to behold the
face of their Master and to fill their intellects with the
radiance of his light. ..A man cannot see the beauty that
is within himself until he has discounted and despised
all the beauty that is outside him. . .A man who is
healthy of soul, who is humble and meek — such a man
— as soon as he turns to prayer, sees the light of the
Holy Spirit within his soul and rejoices at beholding the
rays of his light, delighting in the contemplation of its
glory."
A man can understand the nature of his soul by the
light of the Holy Spirit. "By nature the soul is free of the
passions. When, in Holy Scripture, passions of the soul
and of the flesh are spoken of, this refers to their causes,
for the soul is by nature passionless. This is not accepted
by the adherents of profane philosophy” — or, as we
205. Log. 43, pp. 177-8.158 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
would say today, the adherents of materialist, realist,
and phenomenalist philosophy. On the contrary, God
created the soul.in his image, and therefore passion-
less.7%
There exist three states of soul: natural, unnatural,
and supernatural. "The natural state of the soul is the
knowledge of God’s creation, both visible and spiritual.
The supernatural state of the soul is the contemplation
of the super-essential Divinity. The unnatural state of
the soul is its involvement in the passions,” for the
passions do not belong to its nature.” Passion is an
unnatural state of the soul, but virtue is its natural
state.’ When the mind is fed by the virtues, especially
that of compassion, the soul is then "adorned with that
holy beauty" through which man is indeed in the
likeness of God.” The "holy beauty" of man’s being is
revealed in a pure heart, and the more a man develops
this holy beauty within himself, the more will he see the
beauty of God’s creation.”
This shows that self-knowledge is the best way to
come to a true knowledge of nature and the material
world in general. "He who submits himself to God,"
says St. Isaac, "is close to being able to submit all things
to himself. To him who knows himself is given to know
all things, for knowledge of self is the fullness of the
knowledge of all things.""" If a man humbles himself
before God, all creation humbles itself before him. "True
humility is born of knowledge, and true knowledge is
the fruit of temptation"? — that is, it comes through the
battle with temptations.

Human nature is capable of true contemplation when
it is cleansed from the passions by the exercise of the
virtues. The true contemplation of the material and
immaterial world, and of the Holy Trinity itself, is the
gift of Christ. He revealed this contemplation to men
and instructed them in it, "when he, in his own divine
person, completed the renewal of human nature and,
through his life-giving commandments, cleared a path
to the truth. Human nature only becomes capable of
true contemplation when a man first puts off the old
Adam through enduring the passions, through fulfilling
the commandments and by suffering misfortune. . .In
these circumstances the intellect becomes capable of
spiritual birth and of the contemplation of the spiritual
world, its true fatherland. . .The contemplation of the
new world revealed by the Spirit, in which the intellect
takes spiritual delight, occurs under the action of grace.
. . .This contemplation becomes a food that nourishes
the intellect, preparing it to receive a contemplation that
is yet more perfect. For one contemplation leads into
another, until the intellect is brought into the realm of
perfect love. Love itself is the abode, the "place" of
spiritual man; it dwells in purity of soul. When the
intellect reaches the realm of love, grace works in it and
the intellect receives spiritual contemplation and be-
comes a beholder of hidden things."””
Mystical contemplation "is revealed to the intellect
when the soul has been made whole."”"*Those who have
cleansed their souls by the practice of the virtues
become worthy of spiritual contemplation.” "Purity sees
God."”!* Those who have cleansed themselves from sin

and unceasingly ponder on God behold him.”” "The
kingdom of heaven is called spiritual contemplation, for
this is what it is,"\says St. Isaac. "It is not found through
the activity of thought, but can be tasted by grace. Until
a man cleanses himself he is in no state even to hear of
the Kingdom, for no one can acquire it through teach-
ing,” only through purity of heart.” God gives pure
thoughts to those who live pure lives.”” “Purity of
thought springs from striving and from guarding the
heart, and from purity of thought comes the enlight-
enment of the understanding. From there grace leads the
intellect to the realm where the senses have no power,
where they neither instruct nor are instructed."
By vigilance in prayer "the mind takes wing and flies
upwards," "towards the delights of God.” "It swims in a
knowledge that surpasses human thought.” "The soul
that strives to persevere in this vigilance receives the
eyes of the cherubim with which to dwell in constant,
heavenly contemplation."”’ The soul of man sees the
truth of God through the power of his way of life, that
is, through the life of faith. "If his contemplation is true,
he will find the light and what he contemplates will be
in the realm of truth." "The vision of God comes from
the knowledge of God, and cannot precede this knowl-
edge."
The goal of a Christian is life in and contemplation of
the Holy Trinity. According to St. Isaac, love is "the
primal contemplation of the Holy Trinity." "The first of
the mysteries is called purity and is attained through the
217. cf. Log. 5, p. 26 and Log. 43, p. 177; 218. Log. 19, p. 70; cf.

performance of the commandments. But contemplation
is the spiritual contemplation of the intellect." It comes
from “the mind’s entering into rapture and understand-
ing both that which was and that which will be. Con-
templation is the vision of the intellect. In it the heart is
chastened, renewed, and cleansed of evil, becoming
familiar with the mysteries of the Spirit and the revela-
tions of knowledge, rising from knowledge to knowl-
edge, from contemplation to contemplation, and from
understanding to understanding, learning and growing
secretly until it is caught up into love, incorporated into
hope, until joy takes up residence in its inmost parts,
until it is lifted up to God and crowned with the natural
glory of its own created being." Thus the mind “is
purified and endowed with mercy, actually being
counted worthy to contemplate the Holy Trinity." For
there are three sorts of natural contemplation in which
the mind "is uplifted, active, and engaged”: "two are of
the created world — of the rational and the non-rational,
the spiritual and the bodily; and the third is the contem-
plation of the Holy Trinity."”°
If the ascetic of faith, enriched by the unspeakable
riches of contemplation, turns towards creation, his
whole being is filled with love and compassion. "He
loves the sinner," says St. Isaac, “while loathing his
works."”° He is woven through with humility and
mercy, with repentance and love. He has a heart filled
with love for every creature. "What is a merciful heart?"
"It is," St. Isaac replies, "a heart burning with love to-
wards the whole of creation: towards men, birds,
animals, demons, and every creature. His eyes overflow
224. Letter 4, p. 387; 225. id. p. 384; 226. Log. 5, p. 30.162 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
with tears at the thought and sight of them. From the
great and powerful sorrow that constrains his heart and
from his great patience, his heart contracts and he
cannot bear to hear or see the least harm done to or
misfortune suffered by creation. Therefore, he also prays
with tears incessantly for irrational beasts, for opponents
of the truth, and for those who do him harm, that they
may be preserved and receive mercy. He also prays for
the reptiles with great sorrow, a sorrow that is without
measure in his heart and which likens him to God.'””
When, by an evangelical asceticism, someone moves
from the temporal to the eternal, when he lives in God
and thinks in him, when he speaks "as of God" (2 Cor.
2: 17), when he looks on the world sub specie Christi,
then the world is shown to him in its primordial beauty.
With the gaze of a purified heart, he penetrates the crust
of sin and sees the divinely made core of creation. The
contemplation of the Holy Trinity, essentially mysterious
and unknowable, is manifested by the ascetic of faith in
this world of transient and limited realities through love
and mercy, through meekness and humility, through
prayer and toil for each and all, through rejoicing with
those who rejoice and weeping with those who weep,
through suffering with those who suffer and repenting
with the penitent. His life in this world reflects his life
in that other world of mysterious and invisible values.
His thoughts and acts in this world have their roots in
the other world, and it is from the other world that they
draw their life-giving and wonder-working strength and
power. If one were to trace any one of his thoughts,
feelings, acts, or ascetic practices, one would be brought
227. Log. 81, p. 306.The Theory of Knowledgeof Saint Isaac The Syrian 163
to the Holy Trinity as the primary source of them all.
All things come to him from the Father through the Son
in the Holy Spirit. We have the most beautiful example
of this in St. Isaac himself, that great ascetic of the Holy
Trinity who, with St. Simeon the New Theologian, was
able, with the help of grace and ascetic experience, to
give us the most convincing justification of the truth of
the Triune Godhead and of the God-like trinity of man’s
personal being.
Conclusion
St. Isaac's theory of knowledge is dominated by the
conviction that the problem of knowledge is funda-
mentally a religious and an ethical one. From its
inception to its infinite fulfillment in grace, knowledge
depends on the religious and ethical content and quality
of the person, and above all on the religious and ethical
culture and development of man’s organs of knowledge.
One thing is certain: that knowledge, on all levels,
depends on man’s religious and moral state. The more
perfect a man is from the religious and moral
standpoint, the more perfect is his knowledge. Man has
been made in such a way that knowledge and morality
are always balanced within him.
There is no doubt that knowledge progresses through
man’s virtues and regresses through the passions.
Knowledge is like a fabric woven by the virtues on the
loom of the human soul. The loom of the soul extends
through all the visible and invisible worlds. The virtues
are not only powers creating knowledge; they are the
principles and source of knowledge. By transforming the164 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
virtues into constituent elements of his being through
ascetic endeavor, a man advances from knowledge to
knowledge. It could even be possible to say that the
virtues are the sense organs of knowledge. Advancing
from one virtue to another, aman moves from one form
of comprehension to another.
From the first virtue, faith, to the last, which is love
for all, there extends one unbroken path: asceticism. On
this long path a man forms, transforms, and transfigures
himself through the grace of his ascetic endeavors. In
this way he heals his being from the sicknesses of sin
and ignorance, restoring the integrity of his person,
unifying and making whole his spirit.
Healed and made whole by the religious and moral
power of the virtues, a man gives expression to the
purity and integrity of his person particularly through
the purity and integrity of his knowledge. According to
the evangelical, Orthodox understanding found in St.
Isaac the Syrian, knowledge is an action, an ascesis, of
the whole human person, and not of one part of his
being — whether it be the intellect, the understanding,
the will, the body, or the senses. In every act of know-
ledge, in every thought, feeling, and desire, the whole
man is involved with his entire being.
Healed by the grace of ascetic endeavor, the organs of
knowledge bring forth pure and healthy knowledge, the
"sound (literally healthy) doctrine" of the Apostle (1 Tim.
1: 10; 2 Tim. 4: 3; Titus 1: 9; 2: 1). At all stages of its
development this knowledge is "full of grace," for it is-a
product of the working together of man’s voluntary
ascesis and God's grace-filled power. The whole of man
shares in it with the whole of God. For this reason St.
Isaac speaks continually of the recollection, the "gather-
ing in" of the soul, the mind, and the thoughts, a recol-The Theory of Knowledgeof Saint Isaac The Syrian 165
lection that is achieved by the practice of the evangelical
virtues.
But these virtues differ from those of other religious
and philosophical ethics, not only in their content but as
in their method as well. The evangelical virtues have a
specific content linking God and man and their own
specific method of working. In his incomparably perfect
divine-human, or "theanthropic," person the God-man
Jesus Christ both showed and proved that this method,
this divine-human way of life, is the only natural and
normal way of life and of knowledge. The man who
makes this way of faith his own also finds in it a way of
knowledge. That which is valid for faith is valid also for
the other godly virtues: love, hope, prayer, fasting,
meekness, humility, and so forth; for each of these
virtues becomes, in the man who lives in Christ, a
living, creative force of life and knowledge.
In this theanthropic way of life and knowledge, there
is nothing that is unreal, abstract, or hypothetical. Here
all is real with an irresistible reality, for all is based on
experience. In the person of Christ the God-man,
transcendent, divine reality is shown forth and defined
in an utterly empirical way. By his Incarnation Christ
has given to human flesh the most subtle, the most
transcendent, the most perfect reality. This reality has no
bounds, for the person of Christ is limitless. It follows
that human personality has no bounds, nor has men’s
knowledge, for it is said and commanded: "Be ye
perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect." (Matth. 5:
48) This means that the only bounds of human person-
ality and knowledge are the limitless bounds of God.
The person of Christ the God-man presents in itself
the perfect, ideal reality of theanthropic monism: a
natural passage from God to man, from the supernatural166 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
to the natural, from immortal life to human life. Such a
passage is also natural for knowledge when, by the
bridge of faith, hope, and love, it passes from man to
God, from the natural to the supernatural, from the
mortal to the immortal, and from the temporal to the
eternal, thus revealing the organic unity of this life and
the life to come, of this world and the other, of the
natural and the supernatural.
This knowledge is an integral knowledge, for it rises
on the wings of the divine and human virtues and
passes without hindrance through the barriers of time
and space, entering into the eternal. It is of this integral |
knowledge that St. Isaac is thinking when, in defining
knowledge, he says that it is, "the perception of eternal
life," and when, defining truth, he calls it, "the percep-
tion of God."
That which is true for the virtues is true also for
knowledge. As each virtue begets other virtues, and be-
gets knowledge, so each sort of knowledge begets
another. One virtue produces another and sustains it,
and the same is true of knowledge.
The more a man exercises himself in the virtues, the
greater becomes his knowledge of God. The more he
knows God, the greater is his asceticism. This is an
empirical and pragmatic path. "If any man will do his
[God’s] will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it
be of God." (John 7: 17) In other words: it is by living
the truth of Christ that one comes to know its veracity
and uniqueness. This is truly an empirical, experimental,
and pragmatic path. The knowledge of the truth is not
given to the curious but to those who follow the ascetic
way. Knowledge is a fruit on the tree of the virtues,
which is the tree of life. Knowledge comes from asceti-
cism. For the true Christian, Orthodox philosophy is inThe Theory of Knowledgeof Saint Isaac The Syrian 167
fact the theanthropic ascesis of the intellect and of the
whole person. Here, those arresting words of the Savior
are especially significant: "Him who hath, to him shall
be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be
taken even that which he seemeth to have." (Luke 8: 18)
Looked at in the light of St. Isaac’s theory of knowl-
edge, naive realism is both tragically and lethally
simplistic. It can give no real knowledge of the world,
for it makes use of sick and corrupt organs of knowl-
edge. By contrast, theanthropic realism gives a real
knowledge of the world and of the truth that lies
therein, for it uses organs of knowledge that have been
purified, healed, and renewed and can see into the very
heart of all that is created.
Rationalism considers the understanding to be an
infallible organ of knowledge. Therefore, in relationship
with the whole human person, it appears as an anarchic
apostate. It is like a branch that has cut itself off from
the vine, which can have no full life or creative reality
on its own. It is in no state to come to a knowledge of
the truth, for in its egocentric isolation it is divided,
scattered, and full of gaps. Truth, by contrast, is given
to an intellect that has been purified, enlightened,
transfigured and deified by the action of the virtues.
Philosophical criticism is almost exclusively occupied
with the study of the organs of knowledge in their
psychic and physical state as given in the merely human
realm. To this it adds the study of the categories and
conditions which are the premises of knowledge, but it
pays no attention to the need for the healing and
purification of the organs of knowledge. Therefore,
philosophical criticism cannot by itself come to a knowl-
edge of the truth, for it is nothing more than a cautious
rationalism and sensualism.168 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Philosophical idealism is based on transcendental
realities and criteria, but it is in no state to prove their
existence. Founded on transcendental ideas, it is nev-
ertheless unable to attain to the knowledge of the truth
so necessary to human nature or to quench, even in
part, the thirst for eternal truth and enduring realities.
These various epistemological systems are unable to
give to man is given by Orthodox philosophy with its
grace-filled, ascetic theory of knowledge. Here, eternal
Truth Himself stands before human knowledge in the
fullness of His infinite perfection, giving Himself to
enlightened and grace-endowed man. For it is in the
person of Christ the God-man that transcendental,
divine truth comes to man. In Him truth becomes objec-
tively immanent and presents an immediate and eternal-
ly vital historical reality. In order to make this his own,
to make it a subjective immanence, it is essential that
man, by the practice of the virtues, make the Lord Jesus
Christ the soul of his soul, the heart of his heart, and the
life of his life.
Translated by MOTHER MARIA (RULE)HUMANISTIC ECUMENISM
| Serres is the common name for the pseudo-
Christianity of the pseudo-Churches of Western Europe.
Within it is the heart of European humanism, with
Papism as its head. All of pseudo-Christianity, all of
those pseudo-Churches, are nothing more than one
heresy after another. Their common evangelical name is:
Pan-heresy. Why? This is because through the course of
history various heresies denied or deformed certain
aspects of the God-man and Lord Jesus Christ; these
European heresies remove Him altogether and put
European man in His place. In this there is no essential
difference between Papism, Protestantism, Ecumenism,
and other heresies, whose name is "Legion."
Orthodox dogma, that is to say the overriding dogma
of the Church, is rejected by them and replaced by the
Latin heretical overriding dogma of the primacy and
infallibility of the Pope, that is to say of man. From this
pan-heresy heresies were born and continue to be born:
the Filioque, the rejection of the invocation of the Holy
Spirit, unleavened bread, the introduction of created
grace, cleansing fire, superfluous works of the saints,
mechanized teachings about salvation, and from this
sprang mechanized teachings about life, Papocaesarism,
the Inquisition, indulgences, the murder of sinners”
because of their sins, Jesuitism, the scholastics, the
casuists, Monarchianism, and social individualism of
different kinds...

Protestantism? It is the loyal child of Papism.It wen
from one heresy to another over thecenturies because
_
of its rationalistic scholasticism, and it is continually
drowning in the various poisons of its heretical errors.
In addition, Papal haughtiness and "infallible" foolish-
ness reign absolutely within it, ruining the souls of its
faithful. First of all each Protestant is an independent
pope when it comes to matters of faith. This always.
leads from one spiritual death to another; and there is
no end to this "dying" since a person can suffer count-
less spiritual deaths (ina lifetime).
Since this is the way things are, there is no way out of
this impasse for the Papist-Protestantic Ecumenism with
its pseudo-Church and its pseudo-Christianity without
wholehearted repentance before the God-man Christ and
His Orthodox Catholic Church. Repentance is the
remedy for every sin, the medicine given to man by the
only Friend of Man (Christ).
Without repentance and admittance into the True
Church of Christ, it is unthinkable and unnatural to
speak about unification of "the Churches," about the
dialogue of love, about intercommunion (which is to
say, the common cup). Most important of all, one must
become "united in body" with the Theanthropic body of
the Church of Christ, and through it commune with its
soul, the Holy Spirit, and become an inheritor of the
blessings of the God-man (Christ).
The contemporary "dialogue of love," which takes the
form of naked sentimentality, is in reality a denial of the
salutary sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth
(2 Thess. 2: 13), that is to say the unique salutary “love
of the truth.” (Thess. 2: 10) The essence of love is truth;
love lives and thrives as truth. Truth is the heart of each
Godly virtue, and therefore of love as well. And eachHumanistic Ecumenism 171
one of these Godly virtues preaches and evangelizes
about the God-man Lord Jesus as the only Person Who
is the embodiment and image of Divine Truth, that is to
say Pan-Truth. If truth were something other than the
God-man, than Christ in other words, if it were thought,
an idea, a theory, mind, science, philosophy, culture,
man, humanity, the world, or all the worlds, or whoever
or whatever or all it altogether, it would be minor,
inadequate, finite, mortal. Truth, however, is a person,
and yes, the person of the God-man Christ, the second
person of the Holy Trinity, and as such is immortal and
not finite, but eternal. This is because in the Lord Jesus,
Truth and Life are of the same essence: they are eternal
Truth and eternal Life. (cf. John 14: 6; 1: 4. 17) He who
believes in the Lord Jesus Christ grows unceasingly
through His Truth into the divine infinity. He grows
with all of his being, with all of his mind, with all of his
heart and his soul. People live in Christ "speaking the
truth in love," because only in this way "we must grow
up in every way into Him Who is the head, into Christ.
(Eph. 4: 15)
This is always realized "with all the saints." (Eph. 3:
18), always in the Church and through the Church,
because a person cannot grow in Him "Who is the head"
of the body of the Church, in other words in Christ, in
any other way.
Let us not fool ourselves. There is also "the dialogue
of falsehood,” when those who discourse together con-
sciously or unconsciously lie to one another. This kind
of dialogue is customary when the "father of lies," the
Devil, presides, "for he is a liar, and the father of lies."
(John 8: 44) It is also usual for his unconscious and
conscious co-workers to reach their "truth" with the help
of falsehoods when they want to accomplish their goodVie ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
through evil. There can be no "dialogue of love" without
the dialogue of truth. Otherwise this dialogue is not true
and is not natural. Accordingly the commandment of
the Apostle asks that "love be genuine." (Rom. 12: 9)
The heretico-humanistic separation of and detachment
of love from truth is a sign of the lack of theanthropic
faith and of the loss of theanthropic balance and com-
mon sense. At any rate, this was never, nor is it the way
of the Fathers. The Orthodox are rooted and founded
only "with all of the saints” in truth, and have pro-
claimed in love this theanthropic life-saving love for the
world and for all of the creation of God from the time
of the Apostles until today. The naked moralistic,
minimalistic, and humanistic pacifism of contemporary
Ecumenists does only one thing: it brings to light their
diseased humanistic roots, which is to say, their sick
philosophy and feeble morality "according to the human
tradition." (Col. 2: 8) They reveal the crisis of their
humanistic faith, as well as their presumptuous insensi-
bility for the history of the Church, which is to say, for
its apostolic and catholic continuation in truth and in
grace. And the holy, apostolic, patristic, God-minded-
ness, and common sense are proclaimed by the mouth
of St. Maximos the Confessor in the following truth: "For
faith is the foundation of the things that follow, I mean
hope and love, which certainly sustain the truth." (P.G.
90c. 1189A)
The teaching of the Orthodox Church of the God-
Man Christ, formulated the following about heretics
through the Holy Apostles, the Holy Fathers, and the
Holy Synods: heresies are not a Church, : be
a Church. Th ey cannot have Holy Mysteries,
especially the Sacramentof the Eucharist, the Sacrament
of Sacraments. Precisely because the Holy Eucharist isHumanistic Ecumenism 173
everything and all in the Church: even the God-Man
Lord Jesus Christ and the Church itself and everything
in general of the God-man.
Intercommunion, that is to say participating with
heretics in the Holy Sacraments, and especially in the
Holy Eucharist, is the most shameless betrayal of our
Lord Jesus Christ, Judas’ betrayal. It is especially the
betrayal of the whole of the one and unique Church of
Christ, of the Holy Tradition of the Church. One would
have to rid oneself of one’s Christ-like way of thinking
and one’s conscience before the various sacraments,
before their holy meanings, and the holy command-
ments in order to do this.
First of all we would have to ask ourselves on what
Ecclesiology and on what Theology of the Church is
"intercommunion" based? This is because all of Ortho-
dox Theology is not founded on or based on "inter-com-
munion," but upon the theanthropic reality of commu-
nion, that is to say upon theanthropic Communion itself.
(cfal Cor. 1: 9; 10: 16-17; 2. Cor. 13713; Heb.22:14;'3: 14;
John 1: 3) The idea of inter-communion is contradictory
in itself and totally inconceivable for the Orthodox
Catholic conscience.
The second fact, indeed a sacred fact of Orthodox
faith, is the following: In Orthodox teaching about the
Church and the Sacraments, the single most unique
mystery is the Church itself, the Body of the God-man
Christ, so that she is the only source and the content of
all divine Sacraments. Outside of this theanthropic and
inclusive Mystery of the Church, the Pan Mystery itself,
there are no and cannot be any "mysteries"; therefore,
there can be no inter-communion of Mysteries. Conse-
quently we can only speak about Mysteries within the
context of this unique Pan-Mystery which is the Church.174 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
This is because the Orthodox Church, as the Body of
Christ, is the source and the foundation of the Sacra-
ments and not the other way around. The Mysteries, or
Sacraments, cannot be elevated above the church, or
examined outside the Body of the Church.
Because of this, in accordance with the mind of the
Catholic Church of Christ, and in accordance with the
whole of Orthodox Tradition, the Orthodox Church does
not recognize the existence of other mysteries or sacra-
ments outside of itself, neither does it recognize them as
being mysteries, and one cannot receive the sacraments
until one comes away from the heretical "Churches,"
that is to say the pseudo-Churches, through repentance
to the Orthodox Church of Christ. Until then one
remains outside the Church, un-united with it through
repentance, and is as far as the Church is concerned, a
heretic and consequently outside of the saving commu-
nion. This is because "what fellowship hath righteous-
ness with unrighteousness and what communion hath
light with darkness?” (2 Cor. 6: 14)
The first-most Apostle, with the authority he received
from the God-Man gives us this commandment: "A man
that is a heretic after the first and second admonition
reject [him]. (Titus 3: 10) How can the person who not
only does not reject the "heretical person" but gives the
Lord Himself to this one or that one through Holy
Communion, how can he be a part of the Apostolic and
theanthropic holy faith? Moreover, the beloved Disciple
of the Lord Jesus, the Apostle of love, gives us this com-
mandment: "do not receive in your house" (2 John 1: 10)
the person who does not believe in the incarnation of
Christ and does not accept the evangelical teaching
about Him as God-Man.Humanistic Ecumenism 175
The 45th Canon of the Apostles thunders: "Let any
Bishop or Presbyter, or Deaconthat merely joins in
prayer with heretics be suspended, but if someone has
permitted them to perform any service as Clergyman, let
him be deposed." (cf. 33rd Canon of the Synod of
Laodicea) Isn’t this canon obvious? Even to a gnat?
The 65th Canon of the Apostles directs: "If a clergy-
man, or layman, enter a synagogue of the Jews, or
heretics, to pray, let him be both deposed and excom-
municated," and this is clear enough even for the most
primitive mind.
The 46th Canon of the Holy Apostles says: "We
command that any Bishop or Presbyter who accepts any
heretic’s baptism or sacrifice be deposed; for what
accord does Christ have with Belial or what part has the
believer with an infidel?" It is obvious even to a blind
man that this commandment categorically directs us not
to recognize any of the sacraments of the heretics and
that we must consider them invalid and without divine
grace.
St. John Damascene, the divinely inspired bearer of
the apostolic and holy Patristic catholic Tradition of the
Church of Christ, preaches from the heart that all of the
holy Fathers, all of the holy Apostles, and all of the holy
Synods of the Church taught the following theanthropic
truth: "The bread and the wine is not a type of symbol
of the body and blood of Christ (God forbid) but the
actual body of the Lord itself. . .it is called Communion
since we receive Christ's divinity through it." And truly
it is this, for through it we commune with Christ and
receive His body and divinity; through it we also
commune with and are united to one another; for since
we partake of the one bread, we all become one body of
Christ and one blood, and members of one another, and176 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
are accounted of the same body with Christ. Let us then
make every effort to guard against receiving commu-
nion from heretics or giving it to them. "Give not that
which is holy to dogs," says the Lord, "neither cast ye
your pearls before swine," (Matt. 7: 6) lest we become
sharers in their false teachings and their condemnation.
If there is such a union with Christ and with each other,
then we truly become united with all those with whom
we commune, for this union comes from a deliberate
choice and not without the intervention of our judg-
ment. For we are all one body, because we partake of
the one bread, as the divine Apostle says (1 Cor. 10: 17).

D.C., 1958, 359, 360, 361.)
Theodore of Studion, the fearless confessor of thean-
thropic Orthodox truths proclaims to all the people of
the world: "To receive Communion from a heretic or
one who evidently corrupts it before a strange god
makes one familiar with the Devil." (Theodore of
Studion PG. c. 1668c) According to the same, the bread
of the heretics is not "the body of Christ." (ibid c. 1597A)
Consequently, "As the divine bread of the Orthodox is
received, the participants became one body, in the same
way heretical communion accomplishes the same thing
for those who partake of it, making them one body that
is against Christ.” (ibid c. 1480 CD) In addition, commu-
nion from heretics is not the common bread, but poison
which harms the body and darkens and blackens the
soul. (ibid. c. 1189c)
Let us finish our journey into paradise and hell with
the evangelical thoughts of a contemporary OrthodoxHumanistic Ecumenism 177
Bishop who is equal to the Apostles, the Chrysostom of
the Serbian Orthodox Church, Nicholas of Achrida and
Zitsa of blessed memory (+1956). Humbly and prayer-
fully we hope to elucidate on the problems about which
we are speaking and shed light upon them in a holy
patristic way with the evangelical light of his divinely-
wise thoughts.
Being absorbed in the mysteries of the human race in
a patristic way Bishop Nicholas preaches: The glorious
Prophet Isaiah prophesied the following: "When the
Lord shall arise to strike the earth terribly...the haughti-
ness of men shall be brought low, and the Lord alone
shall be exalted on that day." (Is. 2: 10-11) And the Lord
has risen up many times to strike the earth because
people worshipped men instead of Him, the only God;
because of haughty, living men who imposed them-
selves on others as gods. He arose in our days’ and
truly destroyed the whole earth in His just anger, in
order to break human haughtiness and to humble the
false high-mindedness of men.’
This kind of reaction of God against man often
follows man’s rebellion against God. The heretical
people of our time gave Christ our Lord the last place
at the table of this world, as though He is the least of
' This message by Bishop Nicholas was written during the
Second World War, in fact, in a cell in Dachau in Germany. The
message is published here for the first time and even though it
carries on it the marks and circumstances in which it was written,
it does not lose its value as an important piece of spiritual testimo-
ny.
2 Nicholas died in exile from his homeland, seeing with pain
and sorrow, that Christ. had lost even the last place at its table. Its
leaders had chosen "Europe" instead of Christ.178 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
beggars, while they placed their own great men in the
first seats: politicians, authors, mythmakers, scientists,
capitalists, even tourists, and football players. The eyes
of this people were fixed upon these great men, these
modern gods, while only a few eyes were turned to
Christ, the conqueror of death. This shameless rebellion
of this baptized but heretical people against the most-
high God had to be, of necessity, followed by a reaction
of the scorned God against these lawless people and
nations. And God has truly risen to destroy the earth.
And the people of earth suffered unheard of sorrows
before our eyes. Not only were these deified great men
proven to be extinguished flames, from which no one
seeks warmth any more, but were proof of the following
words of the Prophet Isaiah, according to which people
shall hide "in caves, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in
the caverns of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and by
reason of the glory of His might.” (Is. 2: 19) And did
not this happen in the last war? Did not people on the
different continents go into the clefts of the rocks and
into the caverns of the earth to save themselves from the
European sowers of death, as happened in our country
(Serbia) and elsewhere? And these sowers of death, are
not they none other than those so-called glorious gran-
dees, those idols of the people, who sat at the high
places at the table of this world and scorned Christ as
the beggar at the other end of the table...
The Christ-bearing Bishop preaches the following with
sorrow and hope: Our baptized brothers, who were
carried away by the Papal and Lutheran heresies,
thought themselves to be wiser than Christ. They looked
upon us Orthodox as ignorant and uncivilized people.
But truly the words of Paul were also proven in them:
"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools."Humanistic Ecumenism 179
(Rom. 1: 22) And this was so because they rejected the
spiritual wisdom of Christ, Who walks with the garment
of humility and love, and put on, according to the
example of the pagan philosophers, carnal and worldly
wisdom, which is filled with haughtiness and wicked-
ness.
"And [they] changed the glory of the incorruptible
God into an image made like unto corruptible man...and
[they] worshipped and served the creature more than
the Creator. (Rom. 1: 23, 25) In other words, they took
all of the glory of Christ the Lord and put it over the
shoulders of mortal men, which they then elevated as
the new Messiahs. Such was their perception of glory,
which they got from their godless wisdom. And the
meaning of culture and of civilization was for them
respect for the creature, which is to say visible nature,
and worship of it rather than worship for the Creator;
mortal gods and deified nature! For the present, this is
the latest stop of Western humanity in its unrestrained
and eternal descent from the heights of Christ to the
depths of Satan. This is the climax of the equalization of
people in the old idolatry of Rome and present day
Asia. Thousands of books are written annually glorify-
ing famous people and praising their civilizations, and
thousands of newspapers serve this ephemeral and false
glory daily, and they are found in the service of human
works, praising them, in their exaggerated name which
is called civilization. For this reason God delivered them
up to shameful pleasure and passions, so that they
could find satisfaction only in whatever is earthly and
not heavenly, and only that which gives the devil
gladness and laughter, while the angels of Christ
lament. Their enjoyment is based on the pleasures of the
flesh, in stealing from others, trampling upon the small180 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
and weak, increasing the number of their earthly goods,
and expanding their power and authority in the cunning
conquests of foreign lands, in good times and in dance,
in the rejection of every religion calling it superstition,
in the denial of God, in the totally physical life, in the
shameless recognition of the ape as the ancestor of man,
in the submergence of anthropology into Zoology.
But you might ask: will it be possible for this genera-
tion, this most erring, deluded generation in the history
of man, to return to honesty and the truth? Can it?
Would that the Christ that they despise let this happen
as soon as possible. But when will this be?
This is only going to happen when our Western
brothers start writing books glorifying Christ our God,
and when their thousands of newspapers print praises
of Christian virtues and Christian good works, instead
of writing about crimes and blasphemies against the
Divine Majesty and about the commerce of vile instincts.
When this transformation takes place, then Western
heretical humanity shall be cleansed, and it shall smell
sweetly of heavenly incense.
Then we Orthodox Christians will rejoice because we
will receive our returning brothers.
And pagan people will love Christ and will ask to
become His children because the Christian people will
no longer hinder them from becoming Christ’s children.
And wickedness will not exist among people, nor
wars between the nations, but the peace of Christ, which
is beyond the ability of the mind to comprehend, and
His glory, of which there is no equal either in this age
or in eternity.
The inspired Bishop confesses this theanthropic truth
when he says: The supreme happiness of man is the
appearance of God in the flesh; however the highestHumanistic Ecumenism 181
calamity of man is also his apostasy from that same God
and his return into the service of Satan. This misfortune
has its origin in the non-Orthodox Western peoples,
especially for these two reasons. The first is hatred for
a heretical clergy, the second is hatred of the Jews. Both
hatreds sprouted in the hearts of Western humanity
from the same seed. And this seed is the effort of so
many Christian clerics, as well as Jews, to completely
dominate the life of the people and of the state in every
area. The hatred of such a clergy was transformed into
hatred for the Church, hatred for the Jews, which also
includes a hatred for our Lord Jesus Who was a Jew.
Indeed Christ was a Jew by virtue of His mother and
the people to which He first appeared. However this
people were the first to reject Him and killed Him via a
horrible death. Then what? If someone is against the
Jews, how then can he be against Christ, too? Against
the One Whom the Jews fought against for two thou-
sand years? But there is no logic where Satan drives his
nails.
Instructed by their hatred of the clergy and of the
Jews, Western people gradually rejected Christ, too,
until they finally excluded Him from all of the sectors of
the life and institutions of the people and the state and
confined Him to only the churches. From Him Who said
after His glorious resurrection from the grave: "All
power is given unto me in heaven and on earth," (Matt.
28: 18) from Him these blind people took away all
authority. But they did not only this, they took away
every influence on earth as well, in schools, in the
community, in politics, in the arts, in relations between
people and nations (‘and international relations’—
literally), in science, in literature, and all of the rest.182 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
God, however, cannot be mocked by all this. When-
ever people, as guests become too impudent at the table
of God, a warning has to come from the master of the
house. Two terrible warnings have been given to today’s
generation, two world wars in a period of two decades.
Let the Christian people kneel before Christ Whom they
have insulted, and return to Him that authority, that
honor and glory and respect which belongs only to Him.
And you, too, my Orthodox brothers, must do this, too,
if you want to save yourselves from the third world
war, which will be far more horrible than the previous
two.
The apostolic sorrow of the holy Bishop then asks:
What is Europe?
It is the desire and the longing for power and plea-
sure and knowledge. All of which is human: firstly
human desire and longing, and secondly human knowl-
edge. And the two are personified by the Pope and
Luther. What then is Europe? Europe is the Pope and
Luther, human desire to the extreme and human
knowledge to the extreme. The European Pope is the
human desire for authority. The European Luther is the
obstinate decision of man that everything must be
explained by the mind, the Pope as the ruler of the
world and the scientist as the sovereign of the world.
This is Europe in a nutshell, ontologically and histori-
cally. The one means the surrender of mankind into the
fire and the other means surrender of mankind into the
water. And both mean: the separation of man from God
because the one means the rejection of faith and the
other the rejection of the Church of Christ. For the spirit
of evil has been working in this way on the body of
Europe for a few centuries now. And who can expel this
evil spirit from Europe? No one, except the One WhoseHumanistic Ecumenism 183
name has been marked in red in the history of the
human race as the only One Who expels demons from
people. You already know Who I mean. I mean the Lord
Jesus Christ, the Messiah, and Savior of the world, Who
was born of the Virgin, killed by the Jews, resurrected
by God, witnessed by the centuries, justified by heaven,
glorified by the Angels, confessed by the Saints, and
accepted by our forefathers.
As long as Europe followed Christ as "the sun of
righteousness," and His Apostles, Martyrs, Saints, and
the countless righteous people and others who pleased
Him, Europe was like a square that was illuminated by
hundreds and thousands of candles, large and small,
burning brightly. When human desire, however, and
human wisdom struck as two strong winds, the candles
were blown out and a darkness descended like the
darkness of the subterranean passages in which moles
live.
According to human desire, every nation and every
person seeks power, pleasure, and glory, imitating the
Pope of Rome. According to human wisdom, every
nation and every person finds that he or she is wiser
than everyone else and that he or she deserves all
earthly things. How then can there not be wars between
people and nations? How then can there not be foolish-
ness and wildness in people? How then can there not be
sicknesses and terrible diseases, drought and floods,
insurrections and wars? For just as pus has to seep out
of a pus-filled wound, and a stench has to come out of
a place filled with filth, this has to happen.
Papism uses politics because this is the only way it
can get power. Lutheranism uses philosophy and science
because it believes that this is the only way to obtain
wisdom. And so desire declared war against knowledge184 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
and knowledge against desire. This is the new Tower of
Babel, this is Europe. But in our time, however, there
came a new generation of European, a generation that
married desire to knowledge through atheism and
rejected both the Pope and Luther. Now neither desire
is hidden nor wisdom praised. Human desire and
human wisdom are joined in our times and thus a
marriage has taken place which is neither Roman
Catholic ‘nor Lutheran, but obviously and publicly
satanic. Today’s Europe is neither Papist nor Lutheran.
It is above and outside of them both. It is totally earthly,
without even the desire to ascend to heaven, either with
the passport of the infallibility of the Pope or by the
ladder of Protestant wisdom. It totally denies the
journey from this world. It wants to stay here. It wants
the grave as its cradle. It does not know about the other
world. It doesn’t smell the heavenly fragrance. It does
not see the Angels and the Saints in its dreams. It does
not want to hear about the Theotokos. Debauchery
makes it hate virginity. The whole square which is
Europe is sunk now in darkness. All of the candles are
out. Oh! the awful darkness! Brother plunges the sword
into his brother’s breast, thinking that he is the enemy.
Fathers reject their sons, sons their fathers. And the wolf
is a far more loyal friend to man than man is.
Oh my brothers! Do you not see all this? Have you
not felt the darkness and the wrongdoing of un-Chris-
tian Europe on your bodies? Do you prefer Europe to
Christ, death to life? Moses offered these two choices to
his people. And we also put these two choices before
you. You have to know that Europe is death, Christ is
life. Choose life and live forever.
And here is the shocking lament of the Bishop who is
equal to the Apostles for Europe:Humanistic Ecumenism 185
Oh my brothers! The 18th century is the father of the
19th century, and the 19th century is the father of the
20th. The father fell into great debt. And the son paid
the debts of the father in full, but he became even more
indebted, and his debt was passed on to the grandson.
The father was ill with a very serious sickness, the son
did not cure himself of this disgraceful sickness of the
father, but allowed it to spread even further and so it
was transmitted to the grandson three times stronger.
The grandson is the 20th century, the century we are
living in.
The 18th century signifies the rebellion of the Roman
Pontiff against the Church and the clergy. The 19th
century signifies the rebellion against God. The 20th
signifies the alliance with the Devil. The debts have
increased and the sickness has gotten worse. The Lord
said that he will visit the sins of the fathers unto the
third and fourth generations. Do you not see that the
Lord is visiting upon the grandchildren the sins of its
European fathers? Do you not see the whip upon the
backs of the grandchildren because of the unpaid debts
of the grandfathers?
The anti-Christ king is the beginning of the 19th
century. The Pope, the anti-Christ, is the middle of the
same century. The philosophers of Europe, the anti-
Christs (from the lunatic asylum), are the end of that
century: Napoleon Bonaparte, Pius, Nietzsche, the three
fatal names of the three sickest people of hereditary
sicknesses.
Are these the victors of the 19th century? No, they are
the carriers of the dreaded sickness which was inherited
from the 18th century. The sickest people, Caesar, the
Pope, and the philosopher. . .and yes, not in idolatrous
Rome but in the heart of baptized Europe! These are not186 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
the winners but the losers. When Bonaparte laughed in
front of the holy churches of the Kremlin, when Pius
was declared infallible, and when Nietzsche publicly
announced his worship of the anti-Christ, then the sun
darkened in the sky. And if there were a thousand suns,
they would all have been darkened for shame and
sorrow because of this amazing thing that the world has
never seen before: an atheist king, an atheist pontifex,
and an atheist philosopher. In Nero’s time at least the
philosopher was not an atheist. However, the 18th
century was the century of Pilate: he condemned Christ
to death. The 19th century was the century of Caiaphas:
he crucified Christ. The 20th century is the century of
the council composed of the baptized and unbaptized
Judases. This council declared that Christ was dead
forever and that he was not resurrected. And then, if
you can believe it my brothers, there came unheard of
scourges upon European humanity, lashings unto the
marrow of its bones, by insurrections and wars.
Who is the victor then, if it is not the kaiser, the
pontifex, and the philosopher of the Europe that rejected
Christianity? The winner is the Balkan peasant and the
Russian moujik according to the word of Christ: "for the
least among you is the greatest.” (Luke 9: 48) Who was
the most unknown, meaningless, and least person of the
19th century, the century of the great Napoleon, of the
infallible Pius, and of the unapproachable Nietzche?
Who if it was not the Russian moujik pilgrim "to the
Holy Places," and the Balkan peasant fighter against the
crescent, the liberator of the Balkans?
A satanic plain of battle, a satanic clergy, and satanic
wisdom, this is what the kaiser, the Pope, and the
philosopher of the 19th century were. The Orthodox
peasant of the Balkans presents the complete antithesisHumanistic Ecumenism 187
of these: first of all the heroism of the bearer of the
cross, secondly, the testimony of the clergy, and thirdly,
the fisherman’s apostolic wisdom. The words of the
prayer of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ refers to
them: "I thank Thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because you have hidden these things from the wise and
intelligent and have revealed them to infants." (Matth.
11: 25) And what did God reveal to these simple
peasants? He revealed bravery, the heavenly light, and
divine wisdom. In other words, He revealed all that was
opposite to the Western kaiser, Pope, and philosopher;
it was like night and day.
The Christ-loving holy Bishop says the following
about the god-killing, idol worshiping civilization of
Europe: If Europe had remained Christian it would
boast about Christ and not about its civilization. And
the great but unbaptized nations of Asia and Africa,
who have a penchant and inclination toward spirituality,
would be delighted to understand Christianity and
honor it. This is so because these nations boast about
their beliefs, about their deities, about their religious
books: one about the Koran, the other about the Vedas
and so on. That is to say, they do not boast about the
works of their hands, about their civilizations, but about
something more important which they consider greater
than these things, rather something that is most impor-
tant to their people. The people of Europe, however, do
not boast about Christ and His Bible, but about their
dangerous machines and the cheap products of their
hands, in other words about their culture and civiliza-
tion. And the result of this boasting about its famous
"culture." is the hatred of all non-Christian nations for
Christ and Christianity. Hating the little they hate the
great. Hating European people and their products, they188 ORTHODOX FAITH ANDLIFE INCHRIST
hate the European God. But, shame on Europe, this does
not bother or worry her. Because of something else, she
herself was the first to hate and reject its God. Because
of the influence of an erring Church, this was the
unenviable position its flawed evolution brought it to in
the middle of the 19th century. But to be fair about this,
the people of Europe are not responsible for this; the
responsibility rests with its spiritual leaders. The flock
is not responsible, but its shepherds are.
The proper thing for Europe to do would be to boast
about its Christianity and its great value as its most
priceless inheritance. This would have occurred, as
happened in the first centuries A.D. if Europe had been
synonymous with Christianity, if it was identified with
Christianity. The glorification of Christ and preaching
about Him was the destined mission of Europe by God.
Apart from Christ, Europe has nothing to boast about.
Without Christ, Europe is the poorest of beggars and the
most shameless exploiter of this world.
The Christ-illuminated Bishop tells us this bitter truth
about European education:
Europe’s schools have divorced themselves from faith
in God. And in this lies its transformation into the
poisoner, and in it is the death of European humanity as
well. In pagan civilizations, science was never separated
from religion, even though their religions were silly and
false. This only happened in Europe, in that Europe that
received the most perfect faith. Because of its clash with
its ecclesiastical leaders, Europe became angry and
rejected the perfect faith but kept perfect science. Oh,
my brothers, it rejected divine knowledge and accepted
human ignorance! What foolishness and what darkness!
The God-inspired Bishop says the following about the
voluntary blindness of Western humanity: the West hadHumanistic Ecumenism 189
become moronic. This was the reason for its disgrace
and madness. In Christian times, when the West was
Orthodox, it was concerned with the spiritual and with
its mind. But as much as it removed itself from Chris-
tian truth and virtue, its spiritual vision became less and
less so that it darkened altogether in the 20th century.
All that it has left now is physical eyes to see the
aesthetics of things.
It has armed its external eyes with many excellent
machines so that it can see the perceptible world better
and more precisely, the beauty and color of things and
creatures, their number and measure and size. It looks
at tiny worms and microbes that nobody has seen before
with the microscope. It looks through the telescope and
sees the stars as though they were just above the
chimneys, as no one has looked at them before. But this
is where its vision stops and goes no further. If it
concerns the intellectual aspects and spiritual knowledge
of the hidden nucleus of things, and the meaning and
significance of all of creation in this great universe
around us, about this, oh! my brothers, Western civiliza-
tion is blinder today than Moslem Arabia, Brahman
India, Buddhist Tibet, and spiritualistic China. In fact,
Christ has not been shamed more in the last two
millennia than from it, Europe, where baptized people
are blinder than the unbaptized!
Because of this Paul would say the same thing to the
moronic West today that he said to the baptized Gala-
tians of his day. This is what he wrote to them: "O
foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that ye
should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus
Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among
you...? Are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit, are
ye now made perfect by the flesh?" (Gal. 3: 1-3) Europe190 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
also started in the spirit at one time, but now is ending
up in the flesh, that is to say, with carnal vision, carnal
reasoning, carnal desires, and carnal conquests, as
though someone bewitched it! Its entire life moves in
two dimensions in these days of ours: in its length and
width. It does not know anything about depth and
height. And because of this it is struggling for earth, for
territory, for expansion, for space and only space.
See how it goes from one war to the other, from one
terror to the other because God did not create man to be
just an animal in space, but to penetrate the depths of
the mysteries with his mind, and to climb with his heart
to divine heights. War for the earth is against truth. War
against the truth is war against divine and human
nature.
O bitterness more bitter than gall! How people suffer,
are tortured, and how much they sacrifice for this
temporal deceptive earthly kingdom! If they had suf-
fered but one per cent of these tortures and sacrifices for
the heavenly kingdom, war would have become so
ridiculous as to make them laugh until tears came to
their eyes. It is with difficulty that they give two cents
to Christ, but to the Church of Moloch—to Satan—they
give all their property and all of their children!
Europe should cross itself and follow Christ. It should
remember the Most Holy Mother of God and the twelve
great Apostles, and the scales would fall from its eyes.
And it will again be as beautiful as the Orthodox
Europe of Christ was during the first thousand years.
Then she will be happy, and we will be happy with her.
Then all of the weeping peoples of Europe will rejoice
and sing with us the eternal doxology: "Holy, holy, holy,
Lord of Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of Thy
Glory." Amen.Humanistic Ecumenism 191
The Christ-like humble Bishop says about the arrogant
people of Europe:
The ambitious and haughty people of Europe do not
recognize their own faults. They have lost an awareness
of sin, of sin and repentance. For them, someone else is
always to blame for every evil in this world, never
themselves. Then how is it possible for them to commit
a sin, since they have sat upon the throne of God and
proclaimed themselves infallible! Their religious leader,
the Pope, was the first to declare himself this. The
leaders and the kings of the West then followed his
example. Everyone declared himself infallible, those who
wore the cross and those who brought the sword.
The Christ-loving Bishop says the
following about the trial between Christ and Europe:
If the history of the last three centuries—the 18th,
19th, 20th—were to be given a proper name, then there
would be no more proper appellation than the record of
the trial between Europe and Christ. This is because
nothing has taken place in Europe in the last three
hundred years that did not relate to Christ (Who is)
God. In this trial between Christ and Europe the follow-
ing happens:
Christ says to Europe that it was baptized in His
name and it should remain faithful to Him and His
Gospel.
To this, Europe, the defendant, answers:
All religions are the same. We were told this by the
French encyclopedists. And no one can force us to
believe anything. Europe tolerates all religions as the
superstitions that they are, because of its imperialistic
interests. It does not have any religion, itself. When,
however, it realizes all of its political aims, then it will192 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
settle its accounts very quickly with all of the supersti-
tions of the people.
Christ then asks with sorrow:
How can you people live with only your imperialistic,
material interests, that is to say, only with animalistic
desires for your bodily appetites? I wanted to make you
gods and sons and daughters of God but you go away
from Me and try to become like a pack of animals?
To this Europe answers:
You are old-fashioned. In place of your Gospel we
discovered biology and zoology. And now we know
that we are not descended from You and Your heavenly
Father, but from orangutans and gorillas, that is to say,
apes. And we are perfectly able to become gods because
we do not recognize any other god than ourselves.
To this Christ says:
You are more obstinate than the ancient Jews were. I
raised you up from the darkness of barbarism to the
heavenly light, but you have gone back to the darkness
like a water buffalo goes into the mud. I shed My blood
for your sake. I showed My love to you, when all of the
Angels turned their faces away from you because they
could not stand the smell of hell that came from you.
When you were all darkness and smelly, I was the only
One Who stayed to clean you and illuminate you. Now
stop being unbelievers, because you will only return to
that unbearable darkness and stench again.
To this Europe mockingly shouts:
Get away from us. We do not recognize you. We
follow European civilization and culture, and the Greek
philosophers. We want to be free. We have universities.
Science is the star that guides us. Our slogan is: free-
dom, brotherhood, equality. And our mind is the god of
all gods. You are an Asiatic. And we reject You. You areHumanistic Ecumenism 193
only an old myth our grandmothers and grandfathers
believed in.
With tears in His eyes, Christ says:
Behold now I am leaving, but you will see. You have
left God’s road and you are following Satan’s. Blessings
and happiness have been taken away from you. Your
life is in My hands, because I was crucified for you. And
yet in spite of all this I will not punish you, but your
own sins and your apostasy from Me your Savior, shall
punish you. I revealed the love of My Father to every-
one, and with love I wanted to save all of you.
Europe then says:
Love? Our agenda only includes a hardy and manly
hatred for everyone who disagrees with us. Your love is
only a fable. And in place of this fable we have raised
up the flag: of ethnicity, of internationalism, of the state,
of progress, of evolution, of trans-oceanism, and of
cultism. Our salvation is found in these, so get away
from us.
My brothers, the debate ended in our times. Christ
went far away from Europe, as He did at one time from
the land of the Gadarenes, when the Gadarenes asked
Him to. As soon as He left wars and violence broke out,
and terror and horror, catastrophe, and the breakdown
of everything. Pre-Christian barbarism returned to
Europe, the barbarism of the Avars, the Huns, the
Lombards, the Africans, only it was a hundred times
worse. Christ picked up His cross and His blessings and
left. And what remained was the darkness and the
stench. And now you must decide with whom you will
go, whom you shall follow: the gloom and the stench of
Europe or Christ?
The Bishop, this evangelist who is equal to the
Apostles, says this about "the White Demonization,” that194 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
is to say, about Europe:
What do you think about Europe? The Africans and
the Asiatics call the Europeans "white devils." And so,
they could call Europe: the White Demonization, "white"
because of the color of its skin. "Demonization," because
of the darkness of its soul because Europe rejected the
only true God and took on the throne and the stance of
the Roman Caesars. And this is just as the Caesars,
before the destruction of Rome, proclaimed to all the
peoples of the earth that everyone could worship their
gods as they wished, that Europe would tolerate this.
However, it is their duty to also worship Europe as the
highest of all deities, either in the name of Europe itself
or in the name of civilization. And this is how, my
brethren, this vampire, satanic Rome, was resurrected in
our times, that Rome which, prior to Constantine the
Great, persecuted the Christians with fire and sword,
and hindered Christ as he came to Europe. Only now
the White Demonization has fallen into a worse sickness
than ancient Rome had because, if pagan Rome was
molested by one demon, the White Demonization was
molested by seven wicked spirits, each one of which is
far stronger than the demon of Rome. And so we have
the new idolatrous Rome, the new martyrdom of
Christianity. Get ready, then, for the persecution at the
hands of the White Demonization which is to come.
The new pagan Europe does not boast of any deity
greater than itself. It boasts about its wisdom, its riches,
its power. Like a puffed up balloon which is about to
explode it makes the Africans and Asians laugh with its
boasting, like a ripe tumor ready to open and fill the
universe with its stench. This is today’s anti-Christian
Europe, the White Demonization.Humanistic Ecumenism 195
Europe lives in the vile cycle of inventions. Whenever
someone comes up with a new one, they declare him a
genius. Again, whoever describes the inventions of
others, of these geniuses, he is proclaimed a doctor of
sciences. The inventions of Europe are numerous, almost
countless. Yet none of these inventions makes man any
better, more honest, or enlightened. And not one single
spiritual or moral invention has appeared in Europe in
the last thousand years, only material inventions. And
these inventions of hers have brought humanity to the
brink of destruction, to spiritual darkness, and to a
dismal devastation without precedent in Christian
history. We do not know for sure if Europe, with all of
its inventions, turned away from Christ because of its
own ill will or from the influence of the ill will others.
When the telescope was invented so that far off stars
could be seen, the European scholars studied them at
the expense of the Bible of Christ.
When the microscope was invented, they again
laughed at Christ.
When the train, the steam engine, the telegraph, and
telephone were invented, the air resounded with the
self-boasting of the European at the expense of God and
His Christ.
When engines were invented for traveling across the
seas, for flying in the air, for communicating from great
distances, Christ appeared as useless and as old-fashion-
ed to Europe as an Egyptian mummy. However, Europe
has used all of its inventions suicidally in the last two
hundred years, for world wars, for crime, for hatred, for
destruction, for deceit, for extortion, for the desecration
of what is holy and sacred to the people, for lies,
dishonesty, debauchery, and atheism throughout the
world. And so Europe does not actually fool anyone but196 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
itself. The non-Christian nations have understood what
she is, what she offers and what she wants; that is why
they call her the: White Demonization (the White De-
mons in other words).
Listen to what David the prophet king says: "Some
glory in chariots, and some in horses: but we will glory
in the name of the Lord our God." (Psalms 19: 7) These
braggarts will nod off on the pillows of their false glory
and we will arise. While Paul the Apostle shouts even
louder: O people, "what hast thou that thou didst not
receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou
glory, as if thou has not received it?" (1 Corinthians 4: 7)
Know that all inventions were discovered upon the land
that belongs to God, before the very eyes of God, and
learn compunction and honesty!

Souls, Belgrade, 1968.
¢ From the moment when the question of the human
soul will be brought forth, there will be extended before
us a vast ocean of divine and awesome mysteries. When
again, there is brought forth the question of sin, every
human conscience will be transformed into a spasm
before the inexplicable "a mystery of sin" (2 Thes. 2: 7),
and its power. The human soul, due to its nature,
continuously overflows beyond all boundaries, but the
soul and sin as if they are not of this world but from
another. And truly this is taking place; the soul is from
God, the sin is from the Devil. When the soul surrenders
to God and lives according to His laws, gradually its life
is transformed into paradise. When, however, the soul
is given to sin, this "law" of Satan, its life is gradually
transformed into hell.
e Sin is the only thing that is unnatural in the nature
of man and of the world. "Strange," alien, intruder,
criminal, executioner, homicide—this is sin in every one
of us. But, in its destructive power, this sin is something
worse and more horrible than all else. What? In its
essence, in its energy, it is identified with the Devil since
197198 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
it also corrupts and destroys. According to the unrivaled
definition of St. John Chrysostom "Satan is sin." Within
this definition lies the entire "mystery of sin and law-
lessness" and the entire power of sin and the entire hell
of iniquity. There exists no Satan without sin, and no sin
without Satan. Even in the smallest sin the devil is con-
cealed. Satan is uncharitable to man because "sin, when
it is finished, bringeth forth death," (James 1: 15), and
"the wages of sin is death," (Romans 6: 23). This is the
final atrocity of sin: death. The experience of the human
race testifies that sin and death are identical destructive
energies of the devil. With these, the Devil holds man in
his horrible embrace. But for how long? As long as man
remains unrepentant. The one who repents according to
God’s will is saved.
e In our earthly world, the "mystery of iniquity," the
mystery of sin, and the mystery of evil are enormously
rising. While, on the contrary, the mystery of good,
which exists within the innate conscience of man, is
always connected with its life-giving roots, with the
foundation of every good, God, and certainly our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ. Life and immortality are nour-
ished and maintained through Him. Christ, the God of
every good, came into our earthly world to give us the
medication for every sin, for every evil. Outside of the
sin of human nature, there is no evil. This is the repen-
tance: "Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand"
(Matth. 4: 17). The salvation, the cure, the immortal and
sinless life is at hand. If man rejects this unique pan-
medication, the penitence, then the human being is
inevitably led to demonism, to Satanism, to the kingdom
of evil, to hell.SelectiveWritings of Fr. Justin 199
¢ Through sin, man opposes God, he becomes God-
fighting, an opposition to God. Sin is the main energy of
the Devil because he can bear neither God, nor anything
divine. When he is firmly established in the soul of man,
he gradually destroys all goodness within him, first
faith, then prayer, then love, fasting, alms-giving. With
the desire to sin, man is gradually planning his suicide.
There is no worse form of homicide than that which
occurs through sin; it is truly the murder of man.
Therefore, the main task of the spiritually vigilant man
is to kill the sin within himself, and, in this way, kill the
devil himself, which assassinates us through sin. But
how can man kill sin? How will man kill Satan? This
can only be done through the God-man Jesus Christ,
who became man for this purpose only. He accom-
plishes this through our faith in Him, our love for Him,
our repentance before Him, our prayer to Him.
e Our road and journey of human life, even here on
Earth, is extended from hell to paradise, from Satan to
God. Within this also lies the immortality and the
eternity of man. The unrepentant sin, even on this Earth,
becomes for man an unbearable torture, a hell with all
of its consequences: Anger — one torment, pride —
another torment; hatred — the third torment; avarice,
wickedness, malice — hell, hell, hell. This is because,
within every sin lies Satan, and within him is hell. This
always happens when a sin, any sin, dominates the soul
of man. The salvation of the soul from these torments of
hell is only one: through faith and repentance, the
Life-giver and All-merciful Lord Jesus Christ, who
overflows the soul with the eternal paradisiacal peace
and immortal joy. Only thus can man find, through the200 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Holy Spirit, his justification in Christ, his immortality,
his eternity.
e Only the gospel of Christ fully knows the mystery
of sin and the problem of sin and everything which
hides within it. The prodigal son of the Gospel is the
perfect example of the repentant sinner. The Gospel
shows us that man, through his free will, can share his
life with Earth and with Heaven, with Satan and with
God, with paradise and with hell. Sin gradually strips
man of everything divine in him, paralyzes his every
divine inclination and desire, until it finally throws him
into the bosom of Satan. And then man reaches the
plight of grazing the swine of his master, the Devil. The
swine are passions, which are always greedy and
gluttonous. In such a life, the unfortunate man is
nothing more than insane. In a shocking parable of the
Gospel, the Lord says about the prodigal son, "he came
to himself,” (Luke 15: 17). How did he come to himself?
He came to himself through repentance. Through sin,
man becomes mad, insane. Every sin, even the most
seemingly insignificant one, is always an insanity of the
soul. Through repentance, man comes to his senses,
becomes complete again, comes to himself. Then he cries
out loud to God, runs to Him, and cries towards Heav-
en, "Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy
sight" (Luke 15: 21). And what is the heavenly Father
doing? He is always infinitely merciful upon seeing His
child in a state of repentance. He has compassion for
him, runs, embraces him, and kisses him. He orders His
heavenly hosts, the holy angels: "Bring forth the best
robe and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and
shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted calf, and
kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this is My sonSelective Writings of Fr. Justin 201
who was dead, and is alive again; and he was lost, and
is found. And they began to be merry." (Luke 15: 22-24)
And this is taking place for each and every one of us,
and for the sake of every sinner who repents. Namely,
joy and happiness is taking place in the heaven of the
All-merciful Lord and God, and together with Him, all
of the holy angels.
II. eon Fr. Justin, The Orthodox Philosophyof Truth:
The Dogmatics of the Orthodox Church, Book I, Belgrade,
1932, 22-23, 41, 70.
¢ The sacred dogmas are the eternal and saving
divine Truths because they are based upon the life-giv-
ing power of the divine Holy Trinity, from which all of
the power of the new life in Christ is derived. The new
life in Christ is weaved completely from the dogmas,
from the dogmatic truths of the revelation of God.
e The eternal dogmatic truths, the divine dogmas, are
the subject of the faith, and the faith is an exercise of
man, and therefore, the human mind. All of the evangel-
ical virtues of the exercise and of the grace, with faith
first, are the heavenly bread of the eternal life, with
which man nourishes, makes worthy, sanctifies, perfects
himself, and is restored in his God-likeness. Life within
the Church, through grace, inevitably becomes the
source of knowledge, through grace, of the eternal
dogmatic truths. Living them as the content of his life,
man comes nearer to the authority, the Truth, and the
saving power. Just as the Lord has said: "If any man will
do his will", (namely, of God the Father, "he shall know202 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
the doctrine", for the dogmas, if they are derived "from
God." (John 7: 17).
e Everything in the God-man Christ is real, is incar-
nated. Due to the uniqueness of the Lord lies the fact
that He is the incarnated God and, within the God-man
are all of the incarnated divine truths. Therefore, since
God was:incarnated and along with Him all of the
divine truths, this means that these are realized, have
the possibility to be incarnated in the sphere of human
life and reality, in the limitations of time and space, as
it testifies to the whole New Testament and the entire
history of the Church of Christ and of His Saints.
e The so-called logical evidence for the existence of
God is: the cosmological, theological, psychological,
historical, ethical proofs, and many more, which,
through the passing of time have been formulated into
philosophical rationalism. They cannot, in the Dogmatics
of the Orthodox Church, have a value of real evidence
because they are based on the principles of the relative,
limited, sinful minds and senses of humanity. To the
Church and the Revelation, the truth about the existence
of God is an illogical and irrational hypothesis, which
has the need of proof with the basis of logical reasoning,
the truth which God has revealed to us, and is therefore
the unquestionable, true evidence. As a divine and
given reality, this truth is not dependent on proof and
arguments from rational functions of the mind. The
logical proof proves God so much more than it hides
Him.SelectiveWritings of Fr. Justin 203
III. rom the prologue of the Book of Fr. Justin, The
Orthodox Philosophy of Truth: The Dogma of the Orthodox
Church, Book I, Belgrade, 1932, 9, 11.
The philosophy of the Holy Spirit is the wisdom and
the knowledge, the wisdom through grace and knowl-
edge by the grace of the nature of beings; and this
wisdom possesses as the pupil of the eye the knowledge
of the divine and the human, the visible and the invisi-
ble. The philosophy of the Holy Spirit is at the same
time the creative power which, by "becoming similar
with God" through the road of the ascetico-charismatic
perfection, multiplies within man the divine wisdom
about God, the world and man. This character of the
Orthodox philosophy emphasizes St. John of Damascus
when he says: "Philosophy is to liken with God" and
therefore is "the art of arts and the science of sciences."
As a source of life, the philosophy of the Holy Spirit is
the only art which has the manifold possibilities to
fabricate a God-like and Christ-like personality, and is
the only science which can teach the selfish and mortal
man how to overcome death and obtain immortality.
Therefore, the Orthodox philosophy is the art of arts
and the science of sciences.
The mystery of Truth does not lie in things, ideas, and
symbols, but in a person and this person is the Theanth-
ropic person, the Lord Jesus Christ. That is why the
Lord said: "I am the Truth", a Truth all-perfect, always
undiminished and unchanged, always one and the same
in its perfect fullness, always one and the same "yester-
day, today, and forever." (Heb. 13: 8).204 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST

Only the mind which has been cleansed from the
passions and the darkness of sin, and has been sancti-
fied by the grace of the Holy Spirit, is in a position to
feel and to love that which is holy and to live from it
and for it. Only the pure can know the pure: "Blessed
are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." First they
will see Him in the face of His saints because God "rests
in His saints." There they will also see every divine gift
which is placed upon every creature of God.

rom the book of Fr. Justin, Dostoievski, Bel-
¢ The human conscience is a gift of God. It is so mys-
terious and enigmatic in its immediateness and reality
that nothing less than God could give it to man. In its
most inner cell, the human conscience is God-conscience
because in essence the conscience has been given as a
divine gift to man. Man could not have a self-con-
science, if this had never been given to him by God.'
¢ The true and real God-knowledge and self-knowled-
ge is obtained by man only through the path of real
love. By loving God, man knows that his soul is Christ-
like and immortal. The experience of love as a method
of earning God-knowledge is found in one of the
Gospels, which the God-man donated to the human
"Page 13.SelectiveWritings of Fr. Justin 205
race. Using this method, man quickly finds God and
discovers his own self as well. While he is on the roads
of hatred, man easily loses God and his own self as
well. Having been introduced and used by the God-
man, this method of obtaining God-knowledge and
self-knowledge became and has remained the definite
method of Orthodox gnoseiology.'
¢ In the God-man Christ, there exists something
incomparably greater than the Truth, the Goodness, and
the Beauty. He himself is all of these in an absolute
meaning and, at the same time, something much greater
than them. Whatever good exists for the human soul, .
Christ attracts it toward himself with His invincible
magnet of love. He gives to the human soul that which
not even absolute Truth can give, nor absolute Good-
ness, nor absolute Beauty by themselves alone can ever
give?
e Only one road leads to the knowledge of Truth:
Love. Obtaining Love, which is God Himself, man is
truly uniting himself with God and in this way is
coming closer to real knowledge of Eternal Truth. Love
fills man with God. In proportion to the measure of his
self to God, man knows God. Filled by God, man is
illuminated, sanctified, divined, and in this way reaches
true knowledge of God with the acceptance and practice
of the "first and great commandment." (2 Peter 1: 4) The
divine energy of love introduces the entire man to the
way of divination: it divines the heart, the soul, the will,
Page 17.
Page 18.206 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
and everything else which is human; he lives through
God, feels through God, thinks through God, hopes
through God. Besides this, the mystery of God reveals
the Holy Spirit to man, because "the things of God
knoweth no man, but the spirit of God." (1 Cor. 2: 11)
The Holy Spirit is "the spirit of love" and "the Spirit of
wisdom and of prudence", namely, the Spirit of knowl-
edge.’
¢ The God-man made Love the essence and the meth-
od of the knowledge of God and of the knowledge of
man. This is the main creative power of which the New
Testament is composed. The mystery of the marvelous
Person of Christ lies within love. The mystery of the
evangelical gnoseiology is found in Love. God-human
Love is the new road to knowledge. Its imperative order
is: love in order to know. The true knowledge of
everything depends on Love, is born within Love, grows
through Love, and arrives to perfection through Love.
I love, therefore I know. Knowledge is the result of
Love. The entire philosophy of knowledge is contained
within the entire philosophy of Love. Only if man loves
with a Christ-like Love is he a true philosopher, and
only then does he know the mystery of life and of the
world. Through Love God is God, as Through Love man
is man.”
e The Christ-like personality, led by Christ to the
mysteries of the world of God, sees the Logos and the
logic of the universe and every creation as coming from
Page 213.
Page 222.Selective Writings of Fr. Justin 207
the head of the Creator. When it is mirrored in the
mirror of the soul of such a personality, the creation of
sickness and of corruption rises into responsible impec-
cability and beauty. Within the Christ-like soul is
revealed the final mystery of Creation because it sympa-
thizes with and loves Creation. The loved always reveals
his mystery to that one who loves. The Christ-like
personality observes Creation and nature not as wild
predators which must cruelly subdue their prey but
instead as weak creatures upon which mercy, compas-
sion, and love must be shown. For the Christ-like
personality, Creation is not matter without a soul to
which we must behave with cruelty, audacity, and
exploitation, but as a priceless mystery of God upon
which we must show compassion and mercy through
prayer and love. “Love every creature of God", says
Dostoievski, "and all the creatures together and every
crumb. Love the animals, love the plants, love every
creature.If you love every creature, you will understand
once, then without effort you will begin to understand
more and more every day," (Dostoievski, Brothers
Karamazov).
MAE Somthe book, Philosophical Abyss:
e In all of the world, there is nothing more terrifying
than man. The philosophy of man is unbearable, even to
the minds of the angels, and it provokes sorrow in the
hearts of the cherubim. The endlessness of man is bitter.
Who is not embittered who has tasted with its senses its
Page 256.208 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
bitter knowledge? Let us be honest until the end: If the
marvelous Lord and Savior Jesus Christ had not been
resurrected, and with the light of his resurrection had
not illuminated and given meaning to the endlessness of
man, who could not consider the Creator of such a
being, as is man, incomprehensible and not aGod-man?
Only the most Sweet Lord Jesus Christ, with His divine
love sweetens the bitter mystery of the human being,
filling it with His self, His life, and His endlessness.
Where is the center of the human being? In the Resur-
rected and Ascended Lord Jesus Christ who "sitteth on
the right hand of God." (Col. 3: 1) With the resurrected
God-man, eternity became a common attribute of
human life. Which human thought, desire, and feeling
is now immortal? Only the thought in Christ, the desire
and the feeling in Christ is immortal. Man is a Christian
only if he thinks through Christ, believes, feels, and
desires through Christ (cf. Phil. 2: 5).
e Man is the only being in the entire world who is
extended from paradise to hell. The gamut of human
thought, human reflections, human sense, and human
disposition vibrates in a much greater width than the
angels and Satan. It is greater than the angels because
man can descend to the Devil, but, at the same time, is
greater than the Devil because man can also be elevated
unto God. Man, therefore, is an eternal being, whether
he wants to be or not. When does the immortality of
man begin? It begins from the moment of conception
within the womb of his mother. And when does the
paradise or the hell of man begin? It begins from the
free union of man and Divine good or diabolical evil,
namely, the union of man and God, or man and Satan.
What, therefore, is paradise? Paradise is the feeling ofSelective Writings of Fr. Justin 209
God according to the word of the Holy Fathers. If you
feel God within yourself, then you have already reached
paradise. The saint of our times, Saint John of Krostant,
says, "When God is present in all of man’s thoughts, in
all of his desires, and in all of his intentions, through his
words and through his acts, the kingdom of God has
come upon him. Then man sees God everywhere: in his
holy thought, in his holy action, in the holy matter."
¢ The heart of the invisible is always present in the
heart of the visible. It is within its nucleus. Let us be
honest and pure and we will see that the three worlds
— the universe, the earth, and man — constitute them-
selves as invisible powers or energies dressed within
matter. Every creature in this world constitutes one
created frame with which God has framed His thought,
and all of His creations together, create the luxurious
mosaic of the uncreated "words" of God. Going from
one creation to another, we go from one image of God
to another because God created man "according to His
image.” Every knowledge of ours says to the world and
to man very clearly: this visible world exists and relies
on the invisible world which has no limits and no end.
e According to the teaching of the Orthodox faith,
within the church of the God-man, this is the most
important and the ideal supreme: to find the person of
God within man. Just as you discover it in man, you
discovered his eternal value, His uniqueness, His
immortality, and His eternity. Often however, the divine
image in man is covered with the filth of pleasure, the
thorns of passion, the weeds of sin, and the outer skin
of malice. But you are an Orthodox Christian and you
must remove all of these from the divine image in order210 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
to bring out the human person again in all of his divine
beauty. When you behave in this way, you love man
despite his sin. You will never identify sin, with the
sinner, and evil with the criminal. You shall always
separate the sin from the sinner, you shall condemn the
sin, and you shall have mercy, pity, and compassion for
the sinner just as the Lord had done for the sinful
adulteress of the Gospel of John (8: 3-11). The most
merciful Lord blames sin, but He does not blame the
sinful woman. It is like saying, "I do not censure the
God-like" and "according to the image of God" soul of
yours. You are not the same as sin because you possess
within yourself God- like powers which can liberate you
from this sin. "Go, and sin no more." (John 8: 11)
e The steadfastness and the immortable in sense and
knowledge of the divine reasonableness of the world
characterized the angels and the saints. Complete
absence of this sense and knowledge characterizes the
demons and men petrified by evil. The wavering in this
sense and knowledge characterizes the man with little
faith. Paradise consists of the firm and immortable sense
and knowledge of the divine logic of the world which
was created by God Logos. The Devil is the Devil for
this because he completely and eternally denies the
reasonableness and rationality in the world. For him,
everything is foolishness and absurdity, and for this
reason he must eliminate and destroy them.
e Man is placed on the road between paradise and
hell, between God and Satan. Every thought and reflec-
tion of man, and every feeling of this, brings the soul
one step closer to paradise or one step closer to hell. If
it is reasonable according to God, the thought andSelective Writings of Fr. Justin 211
reflection connects man with the God Logos, the Incom-
prehensible and Invincible, and this, for man, is already
paradise. If, however, the thought is without or against
the God Logos, man is inevitably connected with the
irrational, the foolish, and the Devil, and this is already
hell. Whatever is valid and whatever has power for the
thought is valid and has power for the sense as well.
Everything, then, begins here on Earth, the paradise and
the hell for man. The life of man on this planet is an
enormous drama. Here, the temporal and the eternal
worlds continually clash, the mortal and the immortal,
the good and the evil, the things of the Devil and the
things of the Lord.
¢ Human thought is a curse when it does not want to
be transformed into prayer and does not want to be
perfected through prayer. It is inconceivable for thought
to exist which, before the mystery of the worlds, is not
transformed into a prayerful exaltation and disposition.
Nothing is more admirable than the thought which,
before the view of the world of God, is unconsciously
poured out in our prayers.
VIL. Sear Fr. Justin, "Man and God-man, Studies
about Orthodox Theology,”Athens, 1974.
e Our communion with the Savior Christ establishes
the salvation; communion with Him, as sanctifier, is the
sanctification; communion with Him, as God, is the
divination; communion with Him, as Immortal, is the
immortality; communion with Him, as Risen, is the
Resurrection; communion with Him, as Ascended, is the212 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Ascension and in the right place of God the Father (cf.
Gor, 1:9).
¢ "Now I beseech you. . .that ye all speak the same
thing." (1 Cor. 1: 10) The Christians can all speak the
same when they have the same feelings, the same
thoughts, the same way of life. They obtain this when
they unite their soul with the catholic soul of the
Church, their heart with the catholic heart of the
Church, their mind with the catholic mind of the
Church, and their thought with the catholic thought of
the Church. (cf. Acts 4: 32) Then they think, feel, and
"speak" through the catholic soul of the Church, through
her catholic heart and her catholic thought.
¢ "For we are laborers together with God." (1 Cor. 3:
9) The ideal of the true and perfect man was realized in
the person of the God-man with the God-human syner-
gy. This God-human cooperation, taking place through
the God-human body of the Church, becomes a common
property of man and a common way of life, thought,
action, and of their existence.._In the Church, men are
incorporated with the God-man, Christ, namely are born
with Him and by Him, are transformed with Him and
by Him, are crucified with Him and by Him, are
resurrected with Him and by Him, partake of His
Ascension and by Him, are living eternally in Him and
by Him, are feeling in Him and by Him, are acting with
Him and by Him. In this catholic God-humanization of
man lies his exact salvation and sanctification. The
human race was created for this reason, and the paradis-
iacal life of our forefathers was created in this joyful
synergy with God. The fall occurred when we rejected
this synergy and began to work through sin and cooper-Selective Writings of Fr. Justin 213
ation with the Devil. The God Logos became man in
order to restore the life of Paradise and the order of life
within it, namely the cooperation with God.
e The Lord Jesus Christ was created as a divinely
deep, divinely wide, and divinely firm base for the con-
struction of the Church of God. He, and only He, the
God-man is simultaneously the foundation of the
Oecumenical, local, familial, and the personal Church.
(cf. 1 Cor. 3: 10-11)
¢ The Love, of which the Apostle Paul speaks, is the
love of Christ; it is the love which the Lord called "new
love," and the commandment about it, the "new com-
mandment." This love differs from every other love of
our human world. The whole newness of this love is
found in the fact that it compels us to love as Christ
loves: "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye
love one another; as I have loved you." (John 13: 34) The
God-human "new" love makes the New Testament
eternally new. Personification of such love constitutes
the God-man Christ himself. Through His self He gave
the witness and the assurance of the fundamental
message of the New Testament: "God is love." (1 John.
4: 16) But Christ is not only divine love; He is also the
"God of love." (2 Cor. 13: 11) Because of this, the truly
divine and eternal love is only that one which is derived
from Him, the God-man. (1 Cor. 13: 1ff.)
¢ Undoubtedly, we are only saved as living and
organic members of the theanthropic body of the Savior,
namely of the Church, of a holy Church, apostolic
Church, catholic Church because the Church is nothing214 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
but the whole theanthropic life of Christ, extended to all
the centuries and to the whole eternity. (2 Cor. 13: 4-5)
e There is no true Gospel for man without and out-
side the God-man. The whole annunciation, the entire
Gospel lies only in the God-man. . . What is the Gospel?
The Gospel is whatever Christ is, who, descending from
Heaven to Earth, brought with Him as God, and what-
ever He did for us as God-man, and whatever He gave
us as Savior in His God-human body, in the Church.
These things constitute the Gospel. In other words, the
Gospel is the whole God, all the Truth of God, all the
Justice of God, all the love of God, all the Life of God,
all of the perfections of God, which have been revealed
and given to us by the God Logos, the Lord Jesus. . .
The God- man, Christ, the whole in the whole fullness
of His God-human Hypostasis is the only exact, true
Gospel, the unique, true, good news for the human race.
(Gal. 1: 7)
e The organism of the Church is the most complex
organism of which the human spirit knows. Why? This
is because it is the unique, God-human organism in
which all the mysteries of God and man, all the divine
and human powers, constitute one body. Only the
all-wise, omnipotent God-man, the Lord Jesus, was able
to connect and join all these things in one body, His
body, of which He Himself is the head, the eternal head.
He directs the whole life in this marvelous and wonder-
working body, the marvelous and wonder-working God
and man. Every member of it lives for the whole body,
but also the whole body lives within each one of its
members. All live in each one and for each one. But,
also, each one lives in all and for all. Each memberSelective Writings of Fr. Justin 215
grows with the common growth of the body, but also
the whole body grows with the growth of each member.
All these numerous members of the body, all of these
organs, the organs of senses, the cells, connect in one
eternally-living God-human body, the God-man, Christ
Himself, adopting the energies of each member to the
catholic life of the body. . . The evangelical activity of
each member of the Church, even if it is entirely special
and personal, is always and from every perspective
catholic and general. The task of each member of the
Church is always personal yet collective, personal yet
catholic. Even if it appears that one member of the
Church acts only for himself (for example, the ascesis of
a hermit), in reality he acts for its entirety. Such is the
organization of the God-human organism of the Church,
which Christ Himself directs and leads. (Eph. 4: 16)
e All the Universes, all the existing worlds, and
beings, hold on just amoment! Down all the hearts, all
the minds, all the lives, all the immortalities, all the
eternities because all of these, without Christ are hell for
me, one hell beside the other hell; all are innumerable
and endless hells and to the height and to the length
and to width. Life without Christ, death without Christ,
truth without Christ, the sun without Christ, and uni-
verses without Him are all horrible foolishness, unbear-
able martyrdom, Sisyphian torment, hell! I want neither
life nor death without Thee Oh Most Sweet Lord! I want
neither truth, justice, paradise, nor eternity. NO, no! I
want only Thee, Thou only is everything, in and above
all! .. . The truth, if there is no Christ, is not needed by
me, it is only a hell. Justice, love, good, and happiness,
they are all the same hell without Christ; even God
Himself is a hell if there is no Christ. I want neither the216 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
truth without Christ, nor justice without Christ, nor love
without Christ, nor God without Christ. I do not want
any of them, in any possible way! I will accept any kind
of death, let you kill me in any way you want, because
without Christ I want nothing. Neither myself, nor even
God Himself, wants anything else between these two; I
do not want it, I do not want it, I do not want it! (Phil.
1: 21 and 3: 8)
¢ Our Lord Jesus became man, so that "we may walk
in Him," to live in Him, as in earthly God-man, and not
to see Him from afar, to admire Him, and to philoso-
phize about Him. . . "Walk ye in Him," is the command-
ment of commandments to live, namely in Him, and
Him not adjusting Himself to us, but ourselves to Him,
not changing and altering Him according to ourselves,
but changing ourselves according to Him: neither
remodeling Him according to our image, but remodeling
ourselves according to His image. Only the haughty
lunatics, these foolish, soul-destroyers, falsify and distort
the God-man Christ according to their wishes and their
perceptions from which there are so many "pseudo-
Christs" in the world, and so many pseudo-Christians.
The true God-man Christ, however, in all the fullness of
His evangelical God-human reality, is in a whole present
in His God-human body the Church, as much during
the time of the holy Apostles as today and forever. His
God-human life is extended in the God-human body of
the Church to the ages of ages. Living in the Church wé
are living "in Him" exactly as the Christ-like Apostle
orders. And this, in the most perfect and complete
measure live the Saints, a fact which explains their
miraculous sanctity. Living with the soul and body in
Christ, the Saints are sanctified by Him, become Christ-SelectiveWritings of Fr. Justin 217
like, divinized, become omnipotent, in the same way in
the post-apostolic period as in the apostolic period. And
in the same way now, and yesterday, and tomorrow,
and always “until the close of the age," they preserve the
God-human image of Christ. (Col. 2: 6)
¢ The entire Old Testament was, so to speak, a shad-
ow of the God Logos. As an enormous shadow precedes
the body, in the same way the whole world was walk-
ing before Him. The entire religion of the Old Testament
is the shadow of a religion behind which comes the
body: the incarnated God Logos, His God-human body
the Church. And the reality is this: all of the visible
world is nothing but a shadow, which indicates before-
hand and announces the body that comes behind it, the
incarnation of the God Logos. By His incarnation and
the Church, His body barely reveals the true reality of
the created worlds, their content, their meaning, their
purpose. In the God-human body of the Church, not
only the visible but also the invisible receive their
"body," their most permanent and reasonable (naslogos-
nija) reality. (Col. 2: 17)
e The Church is the life-giving body of the God-man
Christ, and by Him and in Him the body of the Holy
Trinity. The Holy Trinity works the salvation of the
world in the Church through the acts of His grace which
deliver each member of the Church from sin, death, and
the devil, and fill it with the eternal life, the eternal
truth, the eternal justice, the eternal love. The true
Church is "in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Thus, each member of the Church is only a true member
when he is "in God our Father and the Lord Jesus218 ORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
Christ," when he lives in Them and is saved by Their
grace and by the struggle. (2 Thes. 1: 7)
¢ What are "our traditions"? They are everything that
the God-man Christ, He Himself, and by the Holy Spirit,
gave the commandment to hold and to live according to
Them; whatever He delivered in His Church, in which
He dwells continuously with His Holy Spirit. (cf. Matth.
28: 19-29) "Our traditions" are our whole life in grace in
God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit, the life of us Chris-
tians, which began in the Church of Christ, through the
Apostles, by the descent of the Holy Spirit. All of this
life of ours is not from us, but from the Lord Jesus, by
the grace of the Holy Spirit, or, more precisely, our
entire life is from the Father, through the Son, and in the
Holy Spirit. . . Thus, our "traditions" are the new life of
the grace in the Holy Spirit, which is the soul of the
Church, the life in the Eternal Truth of God, in the
Eternal Justice of God, in the Eternal Love of God, in the
Eternal Life of God. Here man is not creating anything,
nor can he create the Eternal Truth, the Eternal Justice,
the Eternal Love, the Eternal Life, but they are for him
to accept, to change into his own. In Christ and in His
Church all of these are given by the grace of the Holy
Spirit to man, are given and "delivered." Man is obligat-
ed to accept these "traditions" and to live according to
them...
Everything which was delivered to the Apostles by
the Savior Christ and the Holy Spirit, constitutes exactly
"the tradition,” the holy tradition, namely the whole
teaching of the Savior and all of the life-giving energies
for the realization of this teaching in the life of man. All
of these were delivered to us "whether by word or by
epistle." The tradition is in part written, while the mostSelectiveWritings of Fr. Justin 219
part was given orally, but all in common constitute the
divine Revelation, namely the Gospel of Christ, the
Gospel of salvation, given by God in the Church for the
salvation of the human race "from now and forever
more." The entire Gospel was delivered to the Church
by the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Holy Spirit, and
precisely for this the Gospel is "the tradition" of God in
all of its broadness. The written Gospel becomes com-
plete with the unwritten Gospel of the Church and by
it it is interpreted through the energy of the grace of the
Holy Spirit, which resides within the Church. In reality,
all of these in the Church constitute one entirety, one
living spiritual body, namely the written and the
unwritten tradition. Therefore, as St. John Chrysostom
says: “Tradition is to seek nothing more” (PG. 62, 488),
because in it is formed everything which is necessary for
the salvation of men and for their eternal life, in the
present and in the future age. . .
In one word, the divine, the God-human tradition is
the deliverance through the centuries and the genera-
tions of the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, with all of His
divine truths and commandments, His mysteries and
virtues, as living God and Savior, in the Church and as
the Church. And this exactly is the Church of Christ as
His God-human body, namely the living, and the Holy
Tradition extended throughout the centuries, the eternal-
ly living God-man Christ and everything He has in
Himself and whatever He brings with Him. (2 Thes. 2:

Chelie MonasteryORTHODOX FAITH AND LIFE IN CHRIST
By .
Father Justin Popovich
This volume is a collection of selected works on important issues writ-
ten by the late Archimandrite and Professor of the Theological School in
Belgrade, Serbia, Fr. Justin Popovich (1894-1979). They are published here
for the first time in book form and in the English language. The volume
presents all the dimensions of the theological, philosophical, and spiritual
thought of Fr. Justin. In these essays the author appears as a dynamic per-
sonality and a theologian with panorthodox authority. The texts demon-
strate his spiritual love and undying devotion to Holy Tradition. Each of
the essays is thoroughly Orthodox and patterned after the great Theolo-
gians and Fathers of the Church.
In this book Fr. Justin expresses his deep admiration for the Orthodox
Church, rejoices in Jesus Christ, and voices in a vivid new language his
gratitude to Him. He proclaims the uniqueness of the God-Man and His
Church and deplores the deviation of contemporary man from Evangel-
ical Truth. His purpose is to express his unshakable faith in the Savior in
order to upbuild the Body of the Church and to protect the revealed truths
of the Gospel from heretical misinterpretations. For him the Christian
Faith does not concern only a certain group of people, but is a matter of
the salvation of all creation and should therefore be applied to all aspects
of life. The text is evidence of the fact that Fr. Justin is one of the foremost
Orthodox theologians of the twentieth century and a very wise interpreter
and firm defender of the Tradition of the Orthodox Church.
The value of this attractively produced book is enhanced by the addi-
tion of three beautiful hymns composed especially for this edition and in
honor of Fr. Justin (in Greek and English), an introduction to his life and
literary work, and some photographs of him and the Monastery of Chelie,
where he spent most of his life. Orthodox Faith and Lifein Christ will be en-
joyed not only by Orthodox Christians but also by all those interested in
Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
