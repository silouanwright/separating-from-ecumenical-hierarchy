Title: On Canon 15 and Ceasing Commemoration of One's Own Bishop
Channel: Orthodox Ethos
Speaker: Fr. Peter Heers

00:11-00:13
Well, let's look at this real quick.

00:13-00:20
So his problem is, you've broken off Eucharistic communion, and yet you do not consider that

00:20-00:24
you've caused a schism, or that we stand outside the church.

00:25-00:26
So for him, this is impossible.

00:26-00:33
But in fact, if you look at Canon 15, you'll see that that's exactly what has been created

00:33-00:34
through Canon 15.

00:34-00:35
And let's do that.

00:37-00:43
This is held in 861 under St. Photius in the Church of the Apostles, before the Atheist

00:43-00:43
Communal Council.

00:44-00:48
This is Canon 15 of this so-called First Second Council, is what it was called later on.

00:49-00:54
And it's a large gathering with the papal legates from the West, and they're ruling

00:54-00:59
on - they're issuing canons - there's actually three canons that are related

00:59-01:03
here to the whole situation - because they had certain phenomena at the time - a lot

01:03-01:07
of confusion, a lot of breaking of commemoration and communion of their

01:07-01:12
of their bishops and patriarchs - there was a lot of chaos - and they - after the

01:12-01:16
Iconoclast - a hundred years of Iconoclasticism - of course there was a lot of chaos -

01:16-01:20
and so they have canons that are condemning those priests or bishops

01:20-01:28
who for non-dogmatic, non-questions that do not pertain to the faith, cease

01:28-01:32
commemoration of their bishops and book off, and condemn those instances.

01:32-01:36
Then they have Canon 15, it says the following, which is trying to say, well

01:36-01:42
yes, but we do have this case where breaking communion or ceasing

01:44-01:50
commemoration is not condemnable, actually is praiseworthy. When is that?

01:50-01:51
That's really important.

01:51-01:51
And why?

01:52-01:54
Why is that something that's praiseworthy?

01:54-01:57
And then if you understand the thinking of the fathers here, you're going to understand

01:58-02:05
why Metropolitan Cyril's stance, which essentially is the basis for the church going underground,

02:06-02:13
not continuing under Sergius, that's - we've got to understand why.

02:13-02:15
And what basis can he have that stance?

02:15-02:18
because that's the stance that then justifies so much more going forward.

02:19-02:22
And so we have to go into the mind of the Father's Union, the canon,

02:23-02:25
and try to understand why Sergius is wrong.

02:25-02:27
You know, Sergius is saying here,

02:28-02:31
"There are things that are incompatible according to his mind."

02:33-02:35
You don't call it schismatics, you don't say we're without grace,

02:36-02:37
because see, how do you think fairly legalistically,

02:38-02:40
you know, just externally?

02:41-02:43
And so there's no grounds for your schism,

02:43-02:45
and yet you have no communion with us.

02:45-02:47
and you don't consider it outside the church. So how does that work?

02:48-02:48
Well, let's look at

02:49-02:51
Cana 15 and see how it works.

02:51-02:55
Now, I'm going to read the whole thing quickly, because we have a lot to cover, so stay with me.

02:55-02:58
"The rules laid down with reference to presbyters and bishops and

02:58-03:01
metropolitans are still more applicable to patriarchs,

03:02-03:03
so that in the case

03:04-03:04
uh... so in

03:05-03:05
so that in

03:06-03:10
case any presbyter or bishop or metropolitan dares to secede or

03:10-03:10
apostatize

03:11-03:14
from the communion of his own patriarch." This is very important,

03:15-03:21
There are brothers here who are justifying their stance against the entire

03:21-03:26
Orthodox Church, saying that we need a break communion with everybody and

03:26-03:30
anyone across the board, all around the world, whether they're my bishop or not.

03:30-03:35
But this candidate doesn't talk about anybody else, anybody but his own bishop,

03:35-03:40
his own patriarch, and fails to mention the latter's name in accordance with

03:40-03:45
the custom duly fixed and ordained in the divine Miskogih, but before a conciliar

03:45-03:47
has been pronounced and his past judgment against him

03:48-03:49
creates a schism.

03:49-03:50
All right, so let me say that again.

03:52-03:55
In case any presbyter, bishop, metropolitan,

03:56-03:58
secedes or apostatizes from his own patriarch

03:59-04:00
and does not commemorate him,

04:03-04:05
and before a conciliar verdict,

04:05-04:06
before a counsel has happened,

04:08-04:09
he pronounces judgment against him,

04:10-04:11
he creates a schism.

04:11-04:13
All right, so this is what Canon 15,

04:13-04:19
This is the canon that many who have ceased commemoration and gone and

04:19-04:22
break communion and set up parallel jurisdictions, such as the Old

04:22-04:25
Calendars groups, this is the canon they cite.

04:25-04:32
In fact, the first part of the canon condemns one who before a council does this.

04:32-04:37
Now we'll look at the second part, which needs some explanation, the exception to this.

04:38-04:38
But this is the basis.

04:39-04:39
This is the basic.

04:39-04:42
First of all, we're stating the basis, and then we're saying the exception.

04:43-04:48
The basis is, before a conciliar verdict, you pass judgment, you break, you cease,

04:49-04:50
you're creating a schism.

04:51-04:56
The Holy Synod has decreed that this person shall be held an alien to every

04:56-04:59
priestly function, in other words, he's going to be suspended, but only be

04:59-05:02
convicted of having committed this transgression of the law.

05:04-05:07
Accordingly, these rules have been sealed and ordained as respecting persons

05:07-05:11
who under the precepts of charges against their own president stand aloof and

05:11-05:13
create a schism and disrupt the union of the church.

05:13-05:16
So they don't say what charges, just charges against their president.

05:18-05:22
But the canon says, "As for those persons, on the other hand, who on account of some

05:22-05:31
heresy condemned by the holy synods or fathers, withdrawing themselves from communion with

05:31-05:37
their president, who that is to say, is preaching heresy publicly and teaching it bareheaded

05:38-05:42
in church, such persons not only are not subject to any canonical penalty on

05:42-05:45
account of their having walled themselves off from any and all communion

05:45-05:49
with the one called a bishop before any conciliar or synodical verdict has been

05:49-05:53
rendered, but on the contrary, they shall be redeemed worthy to enjoy the honor

05:53-05:55
which befits them among orthodox Christians."

05:55-05:56
So what's the exception?

06:01-06:03
because of a heresy already condemned by

06:04-06:10
synods and fathers, withdrawing themselves from communion with their

06:10-06:14
president, who, that is to say, is preaching the heresy publicly and teaching it

06:15-06:19
ahead in the church. So he's totally unapologetic and intransient in his

06:19-06:23
heresy. It's not somebody who's confused. It's not somebody who's just saying it

06:23-06:27
privately. Publicly he's doing it, and he's pushing it on the people. That's got

06:27-06:31
be happening - of his own bishop, again, a heresy that has already been condemned by

06:31-06:41
holy fathers or synods, and this person will be praised, is due to honor among

06:41-06:46
Orthodox Christians, even before any conciliar or synodical verdict is

06:46-06:53
rendered. So that's the exception. It has to be a declared heresy condemned by the

06:53-06:54
synods of the fathers.

06:56-06:59
For they have not defied, it says, they have defied not bishops, but pseudo-bishops, and

07:00-07:03
pseudo-teachers; and they have not sundered the union of the church with any schism, but

07:03-07:07
on the contrary have been sedulous to rescue the church from schism and division."

07:07-07:12
But two things need to be stated again, and really stressed.

07:12-07:21
It's clear here that the aim is not that we simply cease commemoration, cease communion,

07:21-07:27
move on. That the whole point of this canon is that they lead to a conciliar

07:27-07:33
verdict. That's clearly what is important here. Conciliar verdicts are the basis

07:33-07:37
for the stance. There's been a conciliar verdict in the past condemning a heresy.

07:38-07:42
And it's obviously that that's where it's gonna lead, right? So it's happened

07:42-07:46
before, but it's commemorated here before any conciliar

07:47-07:51
synodical verdict. So there will be a conciliar synodical verdict. That has to

07:51-07:52
And that's how the church works.

07:52-07:53
We're conciliar.

07:54-07:56
And so it's going to lead there.

07:56-07:58
That's the point of the stance being praised,

07:59-08:00
that it will lead to this.

08:00-08:03
And therefore, there will be peace in the church

08:03-08:06
because there will be a decision that cannot be gainsayed if it's,

08:07-08:08
of course, following the orthodox faith,

08:09-08:10
on the basis of the orthodox faith.

08:12-08:17
So those who, again, cease commemoration and communion

08:17-08:20
with their own bishop who's teaching heresy publicly

08:20-08:21
and pushing it that's already been done.

08:23-08:26
And that person is doing it for the sake

08:26-08:27
of the unity of the church,

08:27-08:29
which means it's gonna lead to a conciliar decision.

08:29-08:30
That's the aim.

08:31-08:32
It's not an end in itself.

08:33-08:34
It's not just, obviously,

08:34-08:36
that would be total Protestantism, right?

08:36-08:38
If we just said everybody can break community

08:38-08:38
left and right,

08:39-08:40
and it doesn't matter if there's ever a council.

08:41-08:42
No, we want a council.

08:43-08:45
New martyrs are constantly calling for a council.

08:46-08:47
That's how the things are solved.

08:48-08:52
And so that's two words on the canon.

08:52-08:57
Now, going back to Bishop Sergius, why is his analysis incorrect?

08:59-09:00
Why can't he figure it out?

09:00-09:03
So he's not having, he doesn't have in mind this canon, or if he hasn't in

09:03-09:05
mind, he's not interpreting it properly.

09:07-09:12
He would say, well, this is what I'm doing is clearly not recognizing as a

09:13-09:16
heresy or as an illusion, a teaching that's been condemned by the fathers.

09:16-09:23
And on one level, he's right because every time there's a new incarnation

09:24-09:27
of a delusional stance, it's new.

09:28-09:29
So it needs a conciliatory decision.

09:30-09:33
This will need a conciliatory decision as well, as you said.

09:34-09:41
But the stance of saying, we're going to separate from you, not condemn you

09:41-09:47
because we're not the council to condemn you and say you are a heretic.

09:48-09:52
But we're going to separate from you to protect the church from your delusion.

09:52-09:58
And this is the, in fact, in those days, this was the only real weapon they had.

09:59-10:01
They couldn't do much more because of the communists.

10:02-10:07
So they were breaking off communion precisely to do whatever they can to

10:07-10:10
to bring an end to the innovation and the delusion,

10:11-10:13
the usurpation of power and the distortion

10:13-10:15
of the ecclesiology of the church.

10:16-10:17
And yet they're not passing judgment.

10:17-10:19
They're not saying that you're outside the church.

10:19-10:23
They're not saying that there is a, created a schism.

10:23-10:25
They're saying this needs to come to a council

10:26-10:27
and needs to be solved.

10:27-10:29
I think it's totally in the spirit of the canon.

10:30-10:34
That's the narrow path that the canon sets out.

10:35-10:37
It's not an end in itself.

10:38-10:41
Metropolitan Cyril is in the right

10:41-10:43
and is following the spirit of the canon

10:43-10:47
because he's aiming toward a conciliatory decision.

10:48-10:52
He's aiming toward a solution in counsel, ultimately.

10:52-10:57
And he's not pronouncing a judgment

10:57-11:00
as if he's the counsel and the infallible voice of the church.

11:00-11:03
And this is the bound one has to keep

11:03-11:05
if one is going to walk that path, which

11:05-11:14
very difficult path. Notice, it doesn't say "must cease the president, communion

11:14-11:22
with the president." "If, as for those," he says, "who withdraw themselves from such

11:22-11:28
a heretical teacher, they are deemed worthy of honor," it says.

11:29-11:35
It doesn't say they must do it anywhere in this canon. It doesn't say if they

11:35-11:37
going to be punishment.

11:38-11:40
Most canons, if you don't do something, there's a punishment at the end.

11:41-11:45
It simply praises them and protects them from synodical condemnation.

11:47-11:50
It says, "This person shall not be condemned, but should be honored."

11:50-11:56
And of course, the solution to that now rift between the cleric or the bishop or the patriarch

11:56-11:59
is going to have to come through a council.

11:59-12:01
So that's the spirit of the church and the canons.

12:01-12:03
That's why St. Cyril's in the right.

12:03-12:05
And he's not in the right, Metropolitan Surgeons,

12:06-12:08
because his stance is papal-like.

12:09-12:12
His stance is, I will decide, and you are,

12:13-12:15
instead of saying, we have a rift now between us,

12:17-12:19
let's come together as a church in council

12:20-12:21
and solve this, none of that.

12:21-12:23
There's none of that from Metropolitan Surgeons.

12:24-12:27
And if people are doing it today in the same way,

12:28-12:31
if there are local churches or groups of Orthodox

12:31-12:33
who are doing the same thing, saying,

12:34-12:37
you are a heretic, you are deluded, you are condemned,

12:37-12:38
and they just get up and walk away,

12:38-12:40
even if it's a local church,

12:40-12:43
because a local church should not be satisfied,

12:44-12:46
if it's a question of the faith,

12:46-12:49
should not be satisfied with its own decision,

12:49-12:51
but should bring it to the larger church,

12:51-12:53
and there should ultimately be an ecumenical council.

12:54-12:56
So there should never be this complacency.

12:56-12:59
We have condemned, we have ruled, we have defrocked,

12:59-12:59
it's over.

13:00-13:02
That's not a responsible position.

13:02-13:05
It's a papal-like decision, especially coming from only one bishop of course,

13:05-13:10
and a tiny portion of the hierarchy of the church in Russia.

13:10-13:13
So hopefully I've explained why he misses it.

13:14-13:18
He might be correct legally, but he misses the whole spirit of the canon.

13:18-13:20
I think that's why--

13:20-13:22
I think going forward, you're going to see why Saint Cyril

13:22-13:23
is in the spirit of this canon.

13:23-13:26
Now, some people get hung up--

13:26-13:32
And this is a point of debate about, well, has something like ecumenism

13:32-13:33
already been condemned in counsel?

13:34-13:39
Not as such, not as this particular incarnation of this delusion.

13:39-13:41
It's never been condemned in counsel.

13:42-13:46
That is the distortion of the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, the

13:46-13:50
distortion of our understanding of the body of Christ, the blasphemy of

13:50-13:55
claiming there's two churches that are, or there's a church that's filled

13:55-14:00
heresy, or there's a partial church, all these kind of theories that we have, two

14:00-14:05
lungs, you know, the same body theory, all these heretical theories that are trying

14:05-14:12
to, we're trying to pass off as Orthodox, these things are new. Does that mean that

14:12-14:15
we don't know if they're heresy or not? Of course we know they're heresy. The church

14:15-14:19
always knew, even before Arius ever preached, they knew that Arius' position

14:19-14:23
was a heretical position. They needed to come in counsel and condemn it, though.

14:23-14:26
And they actually happened many times, not just once.

14:27-14:28
So if we had the idea that, well,

14:28-14:29
it's already been condemned,

14:29-14:31
we don't need to go to a council,

14:31-14:32
we don't need a council to decide,

14:34-14:36
you would not have the war and the battle

14:36-14:39
and local council and second ecumenical council

14:40-14:42
again coming back and essentially condemning

14:42-14:44
the same heretical stances.

14:46-14:48
And that's why the church didn't see the council

14:49-14:50
in a legalistic manner.

14:51-14:55
but as a need for particular people in a particular time and place

14:56-15:00
to affirm the faith and draw the boundaries for the sake of the faithful.

15:00-15:03
That's what the decisions of the councils are, boundaries.

15:04-15:08
We need a council and the boundaries and discernment

15:08-15:09
of those boundaries

15:09-15:14
to put an end to the particular

15:15-15:15
uh...

15:16-15:19
revealing a particular version of this delusion.

15:20-15:22
There may have been other versions of this in church history.

15:22-15:27
I don't remember anything so clearly against the ecclesiology of the church

15:27-15:29
and church history as today.

15:29-15:31
There, of course, have been many challenges with the ecclesiology.

15:32-15:35
We can go back and we can see the Seventh-day Adventist history

15:35-15:35
and things like that.

15:36-15:41
But in this particular case-- so the question of it being a condemned

15:42-15:44
by holy synods and fathers, well, yes and no.

15:44-15:49
It was condemned essentially, but not particularly, in time and place.

15:49-15:50
And we need to do that.

15:51-15:52
We need to come back and do that.

15:52-15:53
It's essential.

15:53-15:55
We're going to fight the delusion.

15:55-15:57
So the same thing with--

16:01-16:03
on the one hand, the person who today ceases commemoration

16:04-16:08
for ecumenism or surgeonism is right in opposing the heresy,

16:09-16:10
but has not been yet condemned.

16:11-16:12
So it's both/and.

16:12-16:15
Both we need to have people stand up and say,

16:16-16:20
No, this is delusional if their bishop is preaching it.

16:21-16:24
And yet that should not be an end in itself, as if it's already been decided

16:25-16:31
by other fathers and figures in the past, because it's a new version, a new

16:33-16:36
manifestation, which is unprecedented.

16:36-16:41
And it needs to be condemned in particular in our day and age.

16:41-16:44
So anyway, we can't get too much deeper.

16:44-16:46
It's a very deep subject, the question of Cana 15.

16:47-16:49
But I think that what we need to walk away with is

16:50-16:53
that the spirit and the goal of St. Cyril,

16:53-16:55
which was a conciliar solution,

16:55-16:57
which was not a schismatic approach,

16:58-16:59
not a legalistic approach,

16:59-17:03
is what Metropolitan Surgeon doesn't get and misses.

17:03-17:06
And he remains baffled by St. Cyril's position

17:06-17:07
because he's looking at things

17:07-17:09
in a legalistic, superficial manner.
