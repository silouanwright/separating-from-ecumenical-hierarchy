# Orthodox teachings on papal heresy and modern ecumenical contradictions

The Orthodox Church's historical declarations of papal heresy stand in stark contrast to contemporary Orthodox patriarchs' extensive ecumenical engagement with Rome. This research examines authoritative Orthodox sources - from canonized saints to binding synodical decisions - that explicitly condemn the Pope as a heretic, alongside documentation of current patriarchal meetings that appear to violate these teachings.

## The Three Pillars condemn papal heresy

The Orthodox Church venerates three saints as the "Three Pillars of Orthodoxy" who specifically opposed papal teachings as heretical. **St. Photios the Great** (820-891) convened a council of 500 bishops in 867 that condemned Pope Nicholas I, declared him deposed, and excommunicated him along with anyone who followed him. This council made the first official Eastern condemnation of the Filioque addition to the Nicene Creed.

**St. Mark of Ephesus** (1392-1444) provides the most explicit condemnation. At the Council of Florence, he declared: "The Latins are not only schismatics but heretics... we did not separate from them for any other reason other than the fact that they are heretics. This is precisely why we must not unite with them unless they dismiss the addition from the Creed filioque and confess the Creed as we do." On his deathbed, St. Mark refused communion with those who had accepted union with Rome, maintaining absolute separation from what he considered heresy.

St. Gregory Palamas (1296-1359) completes this trinity of defenders, venerated alongside Photios and Mark precisely for defending Orthodox doctrine against Western innovations. These three saints are **universally recognized** by all Orthodox churches, making their condemnations of papal heresy part of official Orthodox teaching.

## Pan-Orthodox synodical declarations of heresy

The most comprehensive Orthodox condemnation comes from the 1848 Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs, signed by all four ancient Patriarchates (Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem) and their Holy Synods. This pan-Orthodox declaration explicitly states: "The said novel doctrine of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son is **essentially heresy**, and its maintainers, whoever they be, are **heretics**." The encyclical condemns Pope Pius IX's epistle as "impious and soul-destroying" and declares it anathema "in the Catholic Church."

The 1895 Synod of Constantinople, responding to Pope Leo XIII, reaffirmed these condemnations. Patriarch Anthimus VII and the Holy Synod declared that the West had "falsified" the Creed and rejected papal infallibility: "The orthodox Eastern and catholic Church of Christ, with the exception of the Son and Word of God, who was ineffably made man, **knows no one infallible upon earth**."

The 1672 Synod of Jerusalem, whose decisions received pan-Orthodox acceptance by 1723, rejected papal universal headship: "Since a mortal man cannot universally and perpetually be head of this Catholic Church, **our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is head**." Significantly, the Sixth Ecumenical Council (680-681) had already anathematized Pope Honorius I as a heretic, establishing precedent for condemning popes who deviate from orthodoxy.

## Orthodox biblical interpretation forbids greeting heretics

Orthodox interpretation of 2 John 1:10-11 ("If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds") specifically addresses interaction with heretical teachers. Orthodox sources emphasize that the "greeting" (aspasmos) refers to formal Christian greetings implying acceptance and blessing of heretical teaching.

Contemporary Orthodox analysis from Orthodox Ethos (2023) maintains these apostolic warnings remain binding: "Saint John the Apostle... warns the Church saying: 'If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.'" Additional passages including Galatians 1:6-9 (Paul's double anathema), 2 Thessalonians 3:6 ("withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly"), and 2 Peter 2:1-19 reinforce the requirement for **active separation** from false teachers.

## Theological arguments establishing papal heresy

Orthodox theology identifies four primary heresies in papal teaching. The **Filioque clause** - adding "and the Son" to the Creed's teaching on the Holy Spirit's procession - is condemned as destroying proper Trinitarian balance. St. Photius's Mystagogy provides the foundational refutation, while the Synodicon on the Holy Spirit formally anathematizes this doctrine. Metropolitan Kallistos Ware states unequivocally: "Orthodox believe the filioque to be theologically untrue... and consider it a heresy to say that He proceeds from the Son as well."

**Papal supremacy and infallibility** contradict Orthodox ecclesiology's conciliar nature. Fourteen Orthodox synods have condemned papal claims, documenting over 200 Holy Fathers who wrote against papal supremacy. The **Immaculate Conception** is rejected as a "Roman novelty" contradicting Orthodox understanding of ancestral sin. **Purgatory** was definitively refuted by St. Mark of Ephesus at Florence and condemned by the Council of Jerusalem (1672).

## Current patriarchs embrace the Pope

Despite these binding condemnations, contemporary Orthodox patriarchs engage in unprecedented ecumenical activities with Rome. **Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew** attended Pope Francis's inauguration in 2013 - the first such attendance since the 1054 schism. He has participated in joint prayers at the Holy Sepulcher (2014), peace prayers in the Vatican Gardens (2014), and refugee advocacy in Lesbos (2016). Previously, he met Pope Benedict XVI in Istanbul (2006), signing a "Common Declaration" calling for strengthened unity prayers.

The most historic meeting occurred in Havana (2016) between **Patriarch Kirill of Moscow** and Pope Francis - the first meeting between a Pope and Russian Orthodox Patriarch in history. Their 30-point joint declaration addressed Christian persecution and called for peace, with symbolic gift exchanges including relics and icons. **Patriarch Tawadros II** of Alexandria went further, signing agreements recognizing Catholic baptisms (2017) and becoming the first non-Catholic to celebrate Divine Liturgy in the Pope's cathedral of St. John Lateran (2023).

These meetings feature embraces, joint blessings, formal greetings, and declarations of brotherhood - precisely the actions that 2 John 1:10-11 and Orthodox interpretation forbid with heretics. Orthodox fundamentalists have responded by calling participating patriarchs "heretics" for falling into the "heresy of ecumenism," though they remain a minority voice.

## The inescapable contradiction

The contradiction between Orthodox teaching and practice could not be clearer. Binding synodical decisions declare papal doctrines "essentially heresy" and their maintainers "heretics." Universally venerated saints explicitly forbid communion with Rome unless it abandons its heresies. Orthodox biblical interpretation prohibits formal greetings and fellowship with false teachers. Yet current Orthodox patriarchs engage in precisely these forbidden activities - joint prayers, formal greetings, declarations of brotherhood, and even liturgical celebrations with those their own tradition defines as heretics.

This research reveals that either Orthodox patriarchs are violating their own church's authoritative teachings by greeting and praying with heretics, or these historical condemnations no longer represent Orthodox doctrine. The theological arguments against papal authority remain unchanged - the Filioque, papal supremacy, and other doctrines continue to divide the churches. What has changed is Orthodox hierarchical practice, creating a fundamental disconnect between historic Orthodox teaching and contemporary patriarchal actions that orthodox believers must reconcile.
