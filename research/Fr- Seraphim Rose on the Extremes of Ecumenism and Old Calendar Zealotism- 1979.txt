00:00-00:05
The first aspect I'd like to talk about concerns what I already mentioned at the beginning,

00:06-00:13
the spirit of worldliness, the watering down of orthodoxy, the loss of the sense of difference

00:13-00:15
between orthodoxy and heterodoxy.

00:17-00:22
These have produced the ecumenical movement in our times, which is leading to the approaching

00:22-00:25
union, the "union" with Rome and the Western Confessions.

00:26-00:28
And such a thing could very well happen in the 1980s.

00:29-00:34
Just in the last year or so, the new Pope of Rome has made overtures to the East, and

00:34-00:37
the Patriarch of Constantinople has said how much he welcomes them.

00:37-00:42
And it could very well be within a few years that there would be a communion between the

00:42-00:49
Pope and orthodoxy, that is, the orthodox jurisdictions that follow the Ecumenical Patriarch.

00:50-00:54
For us, of course, we would be outside that, and it would not concern us directly, but

00:54-00:55
it's something we have to face.

00:57-00:59
This will probably not be a spectacular event,

01:00-01:03
because most Orthodox people in most jurisdictions

01:03-01:05
have become so unaware of their faith,

01:06-01:07
and so indifferent to it,

01:07-01:10
that they will only welcome the opportunity to receive,

01:10-01:13
say, communion in a Roman or an Anglican church,

01:14-01:15
and would not even know what's wrong with it.

01:17-01:20
This spirit of worldliness is what is in the air,

01:20-01:21
and seems natural today.

01:22-01:27
In fact, it might be said to be the religious equivalent of the atheist agnostic atmosphere

01:27-01:30
which is in back of the spread of communism in the world.

01:32-01:38
What should be our response to this movement towards watering down the faith, uniting it

01:38-01:39
with the Western confessions?

01:40-01:45
Fortunately, our bishops in the Russian church outside of Russia have given us a sound policy

01:45-01:45
to follow.

01:47-01:49
We do not participate in the ecumenical movement.

01:50-01:54
Our Metropolitan has warned other Orthodox churches of the disastrous results of their

01:54-01:56
ecumenical course if they continue it.

01:57-02:00
But at the same time, our bishops have refused to cut off all contact and communion with

02:00-02:05
Orthodox churches who are involved in the ecumenical movement, recognizing that the

02:05-02:09
ecumenical movement is still a tendency that has not yet come to its conclusion, which

02:09-02:14
is the union with Rome, and that at least in the case of the Moscow Patriarchate and

02:14-02:19
other churches behind the Iron Curtain, the ecumenism is a political policy which is enforced

02:19-02:21
upon the Church by secular authorities.

02:24-02:29
But thus our Russian Church abroad suffers attacks, both from the left side, from ecumenists

02:29-02:36
who accuse us of being uncharitable, behind the times and all those things which up-to-date

02:36-02:40
modern people are not supposed to be, and from the right side by groups, especially

02:40-02:44
in Greece, who demand that we break communion with all other Orthodox churches and declare

02:44-02:45
them to be without grace.

02:48-02:53
If one looks at the state of the Orthodox Church in Greece, we can see that there the

02:53-02:59
ecumenical movement has produced a reaction which has often become excessive and sometimes

02:59-03:01
is almost as bad as the disease it seeks to cure.

03:03-03:06
The more moderate of the old calendar groups in Greece, those that are broken off from

03:06-03:12
the mainline church, the church in Athens and Constantinople, has a position, this old

03:12-03:16
calendrist church, has a position very similar to that of our Russian church abroad.

03:17-03:23
But among these old calendars there have been schism after schism over the question of strictness.

03:23-03:28
I especially like to direct our attention to this question of strictness, which seems

03:28-03:34
such a good thing to be strict and zealous, but it has a very negative side if we do not

03:34-03:35
approach it the right way.

03:37-03:43
For example, I know one monk on Mount Athos—in fact, he's been in this very monastery—who

03:43-03:48
is in communion with only ten other monks in the whole world, and with nobody else in

03:48-03:49
the whole Orthodox Church.

03:50-03:50
And he is a moderate.

03:53-03:55
He has one priest, who is a very good man.

03:55-03:56
Father Herman met him.

03:57-04:03
And if this priest were to die, he would have nowhere to receive Holy Communion.

04:04-04:08
I asked him, when I saw him a few years ago, what he would do in that case, and he said,

04:08-04:09
"I just don't know.

04:12-04:13
I'm stuck."

04:13-04:19
his immoderate is that he recognizes that there is grace in all the other Orthodox churches.

04:20-04:27
But he is so strict in this policy that because the Patriarch of Constantinople is already

04:27-04:31
speaking about being soon in union with Rome and is already going away from the faith,

04:31-04:36
therefore he has fallen, and anyone who is in communion with him or is in communion with

04:36-04:41
someone who is in communion with him or is in communion with someone who is in communion

04:41-04:44
with someone who is in communion with him, is out.

04:46-04:48
And therefore, being strict, he finds that this network

04:48-04:52
he has established out of strictness includes the whole Orthodox churches

04:52-04:55
every place in the world except in this one little corner of Mount Athos.

04:56-04:57
In fact, not even...

04:59-05:01
Just himself, but even there he finds it.

05:01-05:03
But there's ten others who think like him, apparently.

05:05-05:06
Maybe it's fewer now.

05:08-05:09
But this is a very good man.

05:09-05:11
He's very sincere, very zealous, sort of simple,

05:12-05:16
and he has no answers for other people who are stuck with having to live in the world

05:16-05:16
and things like that.

05:17-05:20
He's very, in some respects, very childlike.

05:21-05:23
But the strictness of his has placed him in such a position

05:23-05:25
that he's like painting himself into a corner.

05:26-05:30
And he has sort of no opportunity to be in fellowship and contact

05:30-05:32
with other people who are actually of the same mind he is,

05:32-05:35
but just haven't got this particular point about not being in communion

05:35-05:37
with those who are in communion and so forth.

05:41-05:45
Other groups in Greece have a spirit which is something close to what one might call

05:46-05:46
fanatical.

05:47-05:52
A few years ago, one of these groups excommunicated our Russian Church abroad because our bishops

05:52-05:55
refused to declare that all other Orthodox Churches are without grace.

05:56-06:02
This group now declares that since 1924 only it has had grace and only it is Orthodox.

06:04-06:08
This group has recently attracted a few converts from our Russian church abroad, so we should

06:08-06:13
be aware that this attitude is a danger to some of us American and European converts.

06:14-06:18
With our calculating, rationalistic Western minds, it is very easy to think we are being

06:19-06:23
zealous and strict when actually we are chiefly indulging our passion for self-righteousness.

06:25-06:30
One old calendar bishop in Greece has written us that incalculable harm has been done to

06:30-06:32
to the Orthodox Church in Greece by what he calls

06:33-06:37
the correctness disease, when people quote the canons,

06:37-06:40
the fathers, the typikon, in order to prove

06:40-06:41
that they are correct.

06:46-06:49
This correctness disease, which occurs when people

06:49-06:51
quote the canons, the fathers, and the typikon,

06:53-06:56
the church services, in order to prove that they are correct

06:56-06:57
and everyone else is wrong.

06:59-07:04
Correctness can truly become a disease when it is administered without love and tolerance

07:05-07:07
and awareness of one's own imperfect understanding.

07:09-07:13
Such a correctness only produces continual schisms, and in the end it only helps the

07:13-07:17
ecumenical movement by reducing the witness of sound orthodoxy.

07:17-07:22
Because now in Greece, the New Calendar Church laughs at the old calendars because there

07:22-07:24
are so many different groups, at least five different jurisdictions.

07:27-07:33
For the first fact about Orthodoxy today and into the 1980s is the worldly spirit by which

07:34-07:36
Orthodoxy is losing its savor.

07:37-07:40
Orthodox Christians are ceasing to be the salt of the world.

07:41-07:45
This is expressed in the ecumenical movement together with the excessive reaction against

07:45-07:51
it, which becomes excessive because it has the same worldly spirit which is present in

07:51-07:52
the ecumenical movement.

07:53-07:56
Can you comment on the following quote from Father Seraphim Rose?

07:57-08:04
What should be our response to this movement towards watering down the faith in uniting it with the Western confessions? Okay, he's talking about ecumenism

08:05-08:09
Fortunately our bishops in the Russian Orthodox Church as Russia have given us a sound policy to follow

08:09-08:11
We do not participate in ecumenical movement

08:12-08:19
Our Metropolitan has warned other Orthodox Christians of the disastrous results of their ecumenical course if they continue it

08:19-08:22
but at the same time our bishops have refused to cut off all contact and

08:23-08:26
communion with the Orthodox churches who are involved in the ecumenical movement.

08:29-08:32
Recognizing that the ecumenical movement is still a tendency that has not yet come to

08:32-08:35
its conclusion, which is the union with Rome.

08:36-08:45
But thus our Russian church abroad suffers, but thus our Russian church abroad suffers

08:45-08:51
the tax from both left and left side from the ecumenist who accuses us of being uncharitable

08:51-08:54
behind the times and the like, and from the right side,

08:54-08:57
by groups especially in Greece, that demand that we break

08:58-08:59
communion with all Orthodox churches

08:59-09:01
and declare them to be without grace.

09:01-09:04
Okay, so you have a quintessential, beautiful,

09:05-09:07
Father Seraphim royal path,

09:08-09:10
walk on the royal path as he always did.

09:11-09:13
And there's all kinds of quotes that people can take out

09:13-09:16
of context, but this shows you that he's clearly

09:16-09:18
understanding the two extremes and temptation

09:18-09:22
on the right and the left, which is extremely important today, right?

09:22-09:29
The Royal path, the narrow path that avoids the extremes is the patristic way.

09:29-09:30
Always has been always will.

09:31-09:32
And it's pointing here.

09:32-09:40
He's pointing here to also inseparable question, which is because he, the,

09:40-09:44
the larger quote, there's a larger quote to this, uh, where he talks about the

09:44-09:48
super correct mentality that dominates the Greek old

09:48-09:49
calendars that he's talking about.

09:49-09:51
He's particularly talking about the situation in Greece

09:51-09:55
in his day and how there's sections of the old calendars

09:55-09:58
that are, you know, goodwill maybe,

09:58-10:00
but they're filled with the super correct,

10:02-10:04
he even gets the phrase I think from a Greek

10:04-10:06
old calendars bishop, super correct mentality, right?

10:06-10:10
Which is very corrosive and sick and divisive

10:10-10:11
and all the rest doesn't actually,

10:11-10:13
he says something that's very interesting at the end,

10:13-10:15
says it doesn't actually do anything to stop the accused

10:15-10:18
actually, it actually undermines the struggle against humanism.

10:19-10:22
The super Greg zealots on the right undermine they don't help

10:22-10:24
they undermine the struggle against humanism. That's also

10:24-10:28
what he says in this quote, I think, larger quote. And so

10:29-10:33
he's brilliantly as always, as all saints did, walking the

10:33-10:37
royal path. And I wanted to say that along with this question of

10:38-10:42
you know, the patrician methodology with regard and

10:41-10:45
the personal understanding of the royal path

10:45-10:47
in this gray area,

10:48-10:51
and the times he was living definitely had that,

10:52-10:53
and they didn't go to either extreme

10:53-10:54
and they upset people on the right and left, right?

10:55-11:01
That has to do with the question of the way, the way, right?

11:01-11:06
And so the Progistic axiom and truism,

11:06-11:07
or whatever you wanna call it,

11:07-11:11
is that a good thing cannot happen in a bad way.

11:12-11:13
And I think Father Seraphim basically has that in mind

11:13-11:15
'cause he's talking about the super correct mentality,

11:15-11:19
which is the way of living our orthodoxy, right?

11:19-11:21
It's a very rationalistic thing.

11:21-11:22
And he does say, I think also in this quote,

11:23-11:25
that the far left and the far right, so to speak,

11:26-11:28
these aren't political terms,

11:28-11:28
we're not talking about political,

11:28-11:32
we're talking about their stance spiritually, meet.

11:32-11:35
They meet, actually, they resemble one another

11:35-11:38
in their methodology and their fanaticism

11:38-11:40
and their rationalism.

11:41-11:42
Now that's my words.

11:42-11:44
I don't know if he says just like that,

11:44-11:46
but he points to that direction.

11:46-11:49
So yeah, I think there's a tremendous quote

11:49-11:54
and Father Seraphim always cutting right down the middle

11:55-11:56
and getting us right to the essence of things

11:57-12:01
in his criticisms of the extremes.

12:03-12:03
Great examples.
