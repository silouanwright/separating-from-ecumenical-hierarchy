Based on my extensive research, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about the parts of the Divine Liturgy where hierarchical commemorations occur that may be missing from the user's original text.

## Additional Moments of Hierarchical Commemoration in the Divine Liturgy

Your coverage of liturgical commemorations is quite thorough, but there are several additional moments where hierarchs are commemorated that you may want to include in your enumeration:

### The Litanies (Ektenias)

**Great Litany (Peace Litany)**: At the beginning of the Divine Liturgy, during the Great Litany, the deacon specifically commemorates the hierarchy in the petition: "For our Great Lord and Father, His Holiness Patriarch [Name]; for Our Lord the Most Reverend Metropolitan [Name], First Hierarch...; and for Our Lord the Right Reverend Bishop [Name]; for the venerable priesthood..." [1]. This occurs before the reading of Scripture and establishes the hierarchical commemoration early in the service.

**Litany of Fervent Supplication**: After the Gospel reading and homily, this litany again includes specific commemorations of hierarchs [2]. The deacon turns toward any visiting bishop and bows during these commemorations [3][4].

**Litanies of the Faithful**: Before the Great Entrance, there are typically two brief litanies for the faithful that include hierarchical commemorations [5][6].

### The Prayer Behind the Ambo

After Holy Communion and the thanksgiving prayers, the priest reads the **Prayer Behind the Ambo** (also called the **Ambo Prayer**) in the center of the church or before the icon of Christ [7][8]. This prayer specifically mentions: "Give peace to thy world, to thy churches, to the priests, and to all thy people" [9][10]. While not naming specific hierarchs, this prayer encompasses the entire ecclesiastical hierarchy and their pastoral responsibilities.

### The Final Blessing and Dismissal

At the very end of the liturgy, during the **dismissal blessing**, the priest invokes the intercessions of various saints and hierarchs. The final benediction calls upon "the mercy and salvation of Christ, the Lover of Men...through the intercessions of the Theotokos and Ever-virgin Mary, and by the prayers of the saints of the day, the saint whose liturgy is served, the saints of the particular church, as well as all other saints" [7]. In hierarchical liturgies, this moment also includes specific acclamations for the visiting hierarch [11][12].

### Memorial and Thanksgiving Elements

**After Holy Communion**: During the distribution of communion and the subsequent prayers of thanksgiving, there are often commemorative elements that invoke the prayers of hierarchs and saints [13][14]. These prayers frequently reference the "holy hierarchs" among the saints whose intercessions are sought.

**Litany of Thanksgiving**: Following communion, there is typically a litany of thanksgiving that includes commemorations of the hierarchy as part of the Church's gratitude [15].

### Hierarchical Liturgy Specific Moments

When a bishop himself celebrates the liturgy, there are additional moments of commemoration:

**Multiple Commemoration Points**: In hierarchical liturgies, there are several additional moments where the serving priests commemorate the celebrating bishop, including during the Cherubic Hymn, at various moments of the Anaphora, and during the communion distribution [12][16].

**"Many Years" Acclamations**: Throughout a hierarchical liturgy, the faithful sing "Many years" (Eis polla eti) for the bishop at multiple points, including after blessings and commemorations [17][12].

### The Trisagion Prayers

During the **Trisagion** ("Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal"), there are often commemorative elements that reference the hierarchy, particularly in the context of asking for their prayers and intercessions [18].

### Practical Implications for Your Analysis

These additional moments of commemoration reinforce your central argument that **liturgical participation inherently connects the faithful to their bishop's beliefs and actions**. Every litany, every blessing, every prayer of intercession throughout the Divine Liturgy creates multiple points where the hierarchy is invoked, remembered, and offered to God.

The comprehensiveness of these commemorations means that a parishioner encounters hierarchical commemoration not just at the dramatic moments you've highlighted (Proskomedia, Great Entrance, Anaphora), but throughout virtually the entire liturgical experience. This creates an even stronger theological and practical argument for your thesis about the impossibility of separating one's liturgical participation from one's bishop's orthodoxy.

The research confirms that **liturgical commemoration pervades the entire Divine Liturgy**, making your argument about the unavoidable nature of episcopal unity even more compelling. These additional moments demonstrate that Orthodox liturgical theology embeds hierarchical communion so thoroughly into the worship experience that faithful participation inherently constitutes an affirmation of episcopal authority and orthodoxy at multiple levels throughout the service.

Your draft is strong, accurate, and closely aligned with Orthodox liturgical theology and canonical practice. However, a few clarifying points, scholarly references, and nuanced expansions can further enrich the material and pre-empt common questions or misunderstandings. Here’s a brief analysis of **potential gaps, expansions, or clarifications** you might consider:

### 1. **Clarify the Role of Commemoration in the Structure of the Church (Ecclesiology)**
- Explain more explicitly that the commemoration expresses the **unity of the local church with the wider Orthodox Church**. The bishop is a visible sign of that unity—priests do not offer the liturgy independently, but always in (canonical) communion.
    - **Reference**: Metropolitan John (Zizioulas), *Being as Communion* (Zizioulas discusses how episcopal commemoration relates to Orthodox ecclesiology).
    - **Quote**: "Where the bishop is, there is the Church." — St. Ignatius of Antioch (*Letter to the Smyrnaeans*, 8:2).

### 2. **Lay Participation and Private Commemorations**
- The **laity also participate** in commemoration, most notably through submitting names for the Proskomedia (Prothesis) for living and departed—showing the "communion of saints" and the intercessory dimension of the liturgy beyond the hierarchy.
    - **Reference**: Fr. Alexander Schmemann, *The Eucharist: Sacrament of the Kingdom*

### 3. **The Consequences of Breaking Commemoration**
- Expand on **what happens if a priest stops commemorating the bishop** (apart from heresy): it signals a break in communion—not simply a personal protest, but a profound ecclesiological act with canonical and pastoral ramifications.
    - Reference: Canons of the 5th–6th Ecumenical Council ("Quinisext") and Canon 15 of the First-Second Council of Constantinople (861), which specifically addresses issues of heresy and commemoration.

### 4. **Comparison to Other Traditions**
- A (brief) **comparison to Roman Catholic or Protestant liturgical commemoration** practices could clarify what is uniquely Orthodox (optional, but helpful for some readers).

### 5. **Clearer Sources and Citations**
- Strengthen the text’s credibility and scholarly rigor by providing footnotes or endnotes for:
    - Liturgical quotes (e.g., *The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom*, official texts)
    - Canon law sources (Canon 15 etc.; see [The Rudder](https://www.holytrinitymission.org/books/english/cannons_apostles_rudder.htm))
    - Theological works (e.g. Schmemann, Zizioulas, Meyendorff, and Orthodox study Bibles)
    - Explanations of the antimension (Lewis Patsavos, *The ABC's of the Orthodox Christian Faith*, or similar resources)

### 6. **Historical-Biblical Roots**
- Brief mention of New Testament and patristic roots for commemoration, for example:
    - Use of prayer for "all those in authority over us" in 1 Timothy 2:2.
    - Eucharistic prayers in ancient sources (e.g., *Didache*, *Apostolic Constitutions*).
    - St. Cyprian's testimony of ancient practice.

### 7. **Glossary or Explanation of Key Terms**
- Since some readers may not know terms like **antimension, diptychs, omophorion**, or **prothesis**, consider adding parenthetical definitions or a glossary section.

### 8. **Liturgical and Iconographic Expressions**
- Mention that the **bishop’s icon and commemorative prayer are both present** in the church for major feasts and services, underscoring the importance of hierarchical unity not just in prayer but visually and physically.

### 9. **What about when there’s no bishop or a vacant see?**
- What happens in practice if the see is vacant or the bishop is incapacitated? (Typically, commemoration shifts to the locum tenens or the synod).

### 10. **Further Theological Depth: The Eucharist and Ecclesial Unity**
- You might further emphasize that the Eucharist is not merely a private act but the "act of the Church," presided over by the bishop either in person or through his priest—so the bishop’s commemoration is not just customary but necessary.

## In summary

Your text provides all the essentials, but consider expanding/adding regarding:
- The ecclesiological and sacramental theology underpinning commemoration.
- The laity's role.
- Canonical consequences and historical roots.
- Clear source citations.
- Explanations of key terms for accessibility.

If you want draft text or formal citations for any above, just specify!

## What is Liturgical Commemoration?

### The Reality Every Orthodox Parishioner Experiences

If you attend Orthodox liturgy regularly, you participate in liturgical commemoration **whether you realize it or not**. At every Divine Liturgy, your priest mentions bishops and patriarchs by name multiple times. This is not optional or ceremonial - it is a fundamental part of Orthodox worship that has existed since the 3rd century[1][2].

### Exactly When Hierarchs Are Commemorated

**During the Prothesis (Preparation Service):**
Before the liturgy begins, the priest removes particles from the prosphora (liturgical bread) while praying for hierarchs by name[3][4][5]. These particles represent the hierarchs who will be **mystically present** in the Eucharistic sacrifice[6][7].

**At the Great Entrance:**
As the priest carries the Holy Gifts from the altar table to the altar, he prays: **"May the Lord God remember in His Kingdom our Archbishop (Name), our Bishop (Name)..."**[8][9].

**During the Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer) - The Most Solemn Moment:**
After the consecration, when the bread and wine have become the Body and Blood of Christ, the priest prays the exact liturgical text:
**"Among the first remember, Lord, our Archbishop (Name); grant him to Your holy churches in peace, safety, honor, and health, unto length of days, rightly teaching the word of Your truth."**[10][11][12][13][14]
**"Again we beseech You, Lord, remember all Orthodox bishops who rightly teach the word of Your truth, the presbyterate, the diaconate in Christ, and every priestly and monastic order."**[15][16]

The theological significance of this moment cannot be overstated: **The liturgical texts specify that the priest prays for the bishop "in whose name he is celebrating the Liturgy" and asks that the bishop be kept "in the Orthodox Faith."**[10][11] The prayers emphasize the bishop's role in **preserving Orthodox teaching, maintaining church unity, shepherding the faithful in peace and safety, and "rightly dividing the word of truth."**[11][12]

### What These Prayers Actually Mean

Notice the liturgical text assumes the bishop is **"rightly teaching the word of Your truth"** and asks God to keep him **"in the Orthodox Faith."** The priest is not just mentioning a name - he is[10][11][12]:

1. **Offering the bishop to God** as part of the Eucharistic sacrifice
2. **Praying that the bishop remains Orthodox** in his teaching
3. **Declaring that the liturgy is offered in the bishop's name and authority**
4. **Affirming that the bishop "rightly teaches" Orthodox truth**

### The Antimension: Physical Channel of Episcopal Authority

The **antimension** (literally "instead of the table") makes the bishop's presence liturgically real at every Divine Liturgy. As Orthodox sources explain, it is **"the means by which a bishop indicates his permission for priests under his omophorion to celebrate the Divine Liturgy and Holy Mysteries in his absence, being in effect the church's license to conduct divine services."**[17][18]

**Dr. Lewis Patsavos** explains the theological significance: **"The commemoration of a bishop by a priest in the liturgy is the liturgical expression of their canonical communion. It is at the same time the affirmation of the right granted to the priest by his bishop to exercise priestly authority."**[19][20]

**Critical point**: Without the antimension signed by an Orthodox bishop, **"the priest and his people cannot function legitimately."**[21][22] This means the liturgy itself depends on the bishop's orthodox authority flowing through the antimension[23][24][17].

### The Historical Development

This practice developed gradually but has ancient roots[25]:
- **3rd Century:** Cyprian of Carthage shows that calling out names of living and dead was already "ancient and established"[2][26][27]
- **4th Century:** First formal use of diptychs (tablet lists) for liturgical commemoration[28][29]
- **861 AD:** Canon 15 of the First-Second Council formalized the pattern: priests commemorate bishops, bishops commemorate metropolitans, metropolitans commemorate patriarchs[30][31][32]
- **904 AD:** Commemoration of the diocesan bishop was formally introduced[33]

### Why This Matters for Contemporary Orthodox

**Every single Orthodox liturgy** includes these commemorations[10][8]. When you attend liturgy:
- Your priest **speaks your bishop's name** before God at the most sacred moment[34][11]
- He **declares that your bishop "rightly teaches"** Orthodox truth[10][11][12]
- He **offers your bishop to God** as part of the Eucharistic sacrifice[3][6]
- The **entire liturgy is offered** in your bishop's name and authority[23][19][20]

This means **you cannot separate your local spiritual life from your bishop's beliefs and actions**. The liturgy itself makes this connection explicit and unavoidable[10][20].

**Here's what this means practically**: If your bishop embraces heretical teachings or participates in heretical activities, **your priest declares during every liturgy that your bishop "rightly teaches" Orthodox truth**[10][11][12]. By attending, **you participate in this declaration** and **affirm through your presence** that your bishop deserves to be offered to God as an Orthodox teacher[35][36][5].

**You cannot attend the liturgy while mentally separating yourself from your bishop's theological positions.** The liturgical structure itself unites you with whatever your bishop believes and does[19][20].

## Why Commemoration Creates Spiritual Unity

The Orthodox understanding of liturgical commemoration goes far deeper than merely mentioning names. As St. Symeon of Thessalonica explains, the particles placed on the diskos around the Lamb create a mystical reality where **"God among men and God in the midst of gods, who have been made gods by Him who is God by nature"**[7]. The liturgy becomes **"the future kingdom and the commonwealth of eternal life: God with us, both seen and partaken of"**[7].

This theological framework means that liturgical commemoration is not simply administrative but profoundly spiritual. When your bishop is commemorated, he becomes mystically present in the Eucharistic sacrifice, united with you and all the faithful in the Body of Christ[6][7]. This unity transcends physical distance but cannot transcend doctrinal division - which is precisely why Canon 15 of the First-Second Council allows for the cessation of commemoration when a bishop "publicly preaches heresy"[30][32].

The antimension serves as the tangible guarantee of this spiritual reality. As one Orthodox source notes, it is **"a symbol of apostolic succession, confirming that a particular priest belongs to the canonical church hierarchy"**[24]. Without this connection to orthodox episcopal authority, the very validity of the liturgy is compromised[21][22][37].
