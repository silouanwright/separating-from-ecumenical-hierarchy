Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and

was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell on their
faces: and they said, The Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is God.

Prologue to the Second Edition
THE PROBLEM OF COMMON PRAYER WITH HERETICS HAS SERIOUSLY occupied the
orthodox plēroma1 over the last several decades, because there has been an
increase in the violations of the holy canons, which condemn common
prayers with incontrovertible clarity. The practice of the Church across a long
span of centuries respected and observed canonical order. Even the Church of
Constantinople, which currently leads the way in commons prayers and gives
a bad example, never dared formally to support the abolition of the holy
canons, although isolated voices of certain of her influential spokesmen
consider the enforcement and application thereof to be anachronistic.
Unfortunately, the unimpeded progress of syncretistic Ecumenism and the
accompanying dulling of the Orthodox conscience for decades, due to the
silence and inaction of those charged with protecting and guarding those
things which the Holy Apostles and Holy Fathers passed down, has
contributed to the emboldening of the Ecumenists in their organization of
“weeks of common prayer” with the participation of clergy and professors of
theological schools, in their fearless participation in the services of the
heterodox. Some of them have even crossed the “red line” reckoned by some
as the final boundary of tolerance and receive the incomplete and graceless
“Holy Eucharist” of the heterodox, thereby “becoming azymites.
” Already
Patriarch Athenagoras, as Archbishop of America, as he himself revealed
whilst speaking to Orthodox priests in Germany according to the witness of
Fr. George Metallinos, would recommend to the priests to commune the
heterodox, as Patriarch Bartholomew did some years ago in Ravenna, giving
Holy Communion to heterodox. Even in the once conservative Church of
Greece a priest and professor of the School of Law, Protopresbyter Costas
Beïs, boasted in writing that he took part in an ecumenistic “Divine Liturgy”
on Syros and received the papist wafer, with neither his bishop correcting
him nor the Holy Synod being willing to deal with this “bare-headed and
brazen-tongued” ignorer of the holy canons.
The peak of all these violations was the most lawless, anti-patristic, and
unprecedented things that occurred at the highest level during the visit of
Pope Benedict XVI to the Phanar upon the feast of the Patriarchal See on
November 30, 2006. Then were heaven and earth amazed beholding the
heresiarch Pope “standing in the holy place” (Matt. 24:15), hymned and
hailed as Savior (“blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord”),
falsely greeted by the Patriarch as “Most Holy Bishop of Rome,
” bearing the
hierarchical omophorion and reciting the “Our Father,
” and many other
things, which Fr. Anastasios mentions and evaluates in the present work. At
the time with our articles we censured this trampling and ignoring of the holy
canons, the cessation of Orthodox succession and of the patristic path, with
the result that we were informed in writing by the Phanar that we no longer
had a place among the ranks of the clergy of the Patriarchate and that we
should inform them to which metropolis of the Church of Greece we wished
them to send our discharge, which we did, thus becoming numbered among
the clergy of the Holy Metropolis of Thessaloniki, with the blessing and
consent of His All-Holiness Metropolitan Anthimos.
One can therefore perceive the effort to silence the Orthodox voices and
to weaken the resistance, so that we may reach the union of the “Churches”
and intercommunion from the bottom, gradually, with the familiarization of
the people to common prayer and concelebration. This will not happen,
though, if the pan-heretical pope does not renounce his delusions and heresies
and return in repentance into the arms of the One, Holy, Catholic, and
Apostolic Church, showing consideration for the salvation of the millions of
members of the so-called Catholic Church.
By the Grace of God, the Orthodox self-consciousness is being
strengthened—
“the word of God is not bound” (2 Tim. 2:9). An abundance
of papers, articles and books on the issue of common prayer with heretics
present the Orthodox stance and convict the violators of the holy canons. The
supporters of common prayer are few and subscribed to Ecumenism,
possessing weak, vulnerable arguments.
Out of all that has been written from the Orthodox perspective, the best of
all, the most excellent, is this book by Fr. Anastasios Gotsopoulos, a blessed
and gifted clergyman not only of the Metropolis of Patras but of all
Orthodoxy. As a university educator, accustomed for decades to proofreading
and reviewing texts and papers, I felt great joy when I received the first
edition of this book for two reasons. Firstly, for the thorough presentation of
the issue, as regards familiarity with the sources and the corresponding
bibliography. It could be submitted as an excellent doctoral dissertation in the
field of Canon Law. His breadth of knowledge of the canonical literature is
astounding. The second and more important reason is that Fr. Anastasios in a
polite manner parleys with the opposition boldly, even if they are high-
ranking clergy and professors of the Theological School of Athens, from
which he graduated, and of Thessaloniki. He is not satisfied merely to set out
the teachings of the holy canons, but to those in opposition he is able to offer
correction and irresistible argumentation with great success. Included among
the ones corrected are some of the premier voices in the field of Dogmatics
and Canon Law. It is true in their case that,
“Professing themselves to be
wise, they became fools” (Rom. 1:22).
For this reason, I accepted most willingly,
“with all my soul and all my
heart”
, the offer by Fr. Anastasios to be involved in the publication of this
book—unique in terms of its thoroughness and approach—through the
“Theodromia” Publications of the Society for Orthodox Studies, in its second
edition, improved and supplemented.
Truly, besides the improvements in typesetting and changes which in no
way touched upon the excellent content, the present second edition is
supplemented with an Appendix which includes (1) commentary on the
article by Prof. V. Pheidas in support of common prayer and (2) the
correspondence between Fr. Anastasios and +Protopresbyter Fr. George
Tsetsis, who called upon the article of Professor V. Pheidas in support of
ecumenistic common prayers.
I close my prologue to the second edition with joy for the contribution to
the Orthodox pleroma of such a special patristic book which addresses the
issue of common prayer with thoroughness, and with jubilation that God
raises up from the younger generation talented defenders and confessors of
the Orthodox Faith against the worldly-powerful leaders of the pan-heresy of
Ecumenism.

Prologue to the First Edition
IN THE ERA OF THE BREAKDOWN OF EVERY TYPE OF BARRIER and of seamless
communication between peoples and cultures, the patristic and canonical
injunction “that one must not join in prayer with heretics or schismatics”
comes across as unrealistic and as a challenge to the modern man.
The provocation is to be found in each word:
“One must not”: Who is so bold as to delineate what “should be” and
what “should not be” for contemporary, autonomous man?
“Heresy”: Why is it bad? Is this not yet another valid perspective on the
Gospel Truth, parallel and of equal value to the historic Church?
“Common prayer”: In truth, what is prayer?
And, in the final analysis: The world has serious problems! Are these the
things with which we should concern ourselves right now?
The provocation of the canonical tradition does not concern only those
outside of Orthodoxy, who naturally do not possess the presuppositions
required to understand patristic teaching. Many times this provocation is
much more unremitting for those within the Church, when they feel that
certain of her commands do not serve their purposes or their interests.
It is this provocation that we will be so bold as to take up in the present
work. This work is strictly limited to the issue of common prayer with
heretics and does not extend to other related questions that regard the stance
of our Orthodox Church against the heretics and schismatics (the reception of
the heterodox into Orthodoxy, the acceptance of the “sacraments” of the
heretics, et al.). Neither does it mention nor comment upon developments
along the path of inter-Christian dialogue between the Orthodox Church and
the heterodox and the question of how successful Orthodox witness to “those
near and those far” has been.
I submit my small contribution with the hope and prayer that God, Who
used a mute donkey to bear His message to Balaam, would cover with His
Grace the failures, fulfill what is lacking and make the most of this humble
effort unto the glory of His Holy Name. The profit gained from the present
work will be immense if it serves to kindle further study and immersion into
our tradition, if it contributes even in some small part to healthy and God-
loving skepticism and uneasiness, far from fanaticism and extremes, with
respect and love for the personhood and service of every member of our
Orthodox Church.
Certainly, to borrow the words of St. Dionysius of Alexandria (Canon 4),
“I, for my part, have thus set forth my opinions in public, not as a teacher, but
only as it becomes us with all simplicity to confer with each other. And when
you have examined this opinion of mine, my most intelligent son, you will
write back to me your notion of these matters, and let me know whatever may
seem to you to be just and preferable, and whether you approve of my
judgment in these things. I pray that it may fare well with you, my beloved
son, as you minister to the Lord in peace.

Introduction
ACCORDING TO THE TEACHING OF OUR CHURCH, EVEN FROM apostolic times,
heresy has catastrophic consequences for man. It distances him from God and
leads him to utter destruction. For this reason, the Lord Himself and His
Apostles are especially strict regarding “heresies unto destruction.
”2
The Fathers of the Church underscore this great danger and, following the
apostolic recommendations,
3 call upon Christians and indeed those unlearned
in the faith not to have any relations with heretics, because it is certain that
their salvation will be imperiled.
4
Unfortunately, however, many who do not have a substantial relationship
with the spirit of the Fathers and with the life of our Church see hatred and
enmity on the part of the Church toward the heretics behind these
prohibitions. Nevertheless, Eugenios (Voulgaris), Archbishop of Slaviansk
and Cherson, concisely summarizes our Orthodox teaching and urges: “Turn
away from faithlessness and heresy and schism, not from the faithless and
heretic and schismatic, not from the man. Turn away from the opinion, not
the nature. Because of the former he is foreign and different; he is liable to
aversion and hatred. Because of the latter, he is familiar and a neighbor and
worthy of mercy and sympathy and oftentimes even of guardianship and
care.
”5 “The prohibitions against various forms of communication with
heretics essentially originated from the love of the Church. The Church, in
other words, tried on the one hand to preserve her healthy members from the
soul-killing ailment of the cacodox and, on the other hand, to trouble the
latter with her position and make them understand that they are on an
erroneous path. That is, abstinence from communion with them had at the
same time a pedagogical character.
”6
Upon studying the patristic teaching on our relations with heretics, we see
that our saints are especially strict and categorical in the prohibition against
contact with heretics or schismatics7 in matters of worship and common
prayer. The relevant references among the Fathers are plentiful.
8 In the
present short work, we will not refer extensively to the patristic witness but
instead mainly to the canonical tradition of our Church regarding the matter
of common prayer with heretics.
It must be made totally clear, though, that when we are referring to
heretics, we cannot apply a monolithic approach; discernment is required.
Also, we must acknowledge that “Orthodox Tradition distinguishes between
originators of heresies and their unknowing followers and supporters: ‘some
became the champions and leaders of impiety, while such others were
assigned a lower rank, as had been shaken by fear, enslaved by need,
fascinated by flattery, or beguiled in ignorance; the last being the least
guilty… For while we might pardon laymen in such a case, and often they
escape because they are not put to the test, yet how can we excuse a teacher,
whose duty it is, unless he is falsely so-called, to correct the ignorance of
others?”9
Here is another related stance, attributed to Athanasius the Great:
“Question 116: Are all heretics, therefore, going to perdition, or not? Answer:
There is heresy and heresy, and there is judgement and judgement… and in
one and the same heresy, there [are] many and diverse judgements. One is the
sin of the bishop who deludes the people, another that of the cleric who is
able to learn the Orthodox faith. Still another is that of the one who is unable
to learn, and yet another, that of him who anathematizes truth and wars
against us. One is that of him who errs in knowledge, and another that of him
who does so in ignorance…All of these things He knows perfectly Who will
judge the world in righteousness.
”10
Chapter I
Common Prayer in the Canonical Tradition & in
Contemporary Practice
What Is and What Is Not Common Prayer?
IN ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE, ACCORDING TO IOANNIS STAMATAKOS, συνεύχομαι
means “I pray in common with someone, I unite my prayers with his.
”11 In
the patristic literature, according to G.W.H. Lampe, συμπροσεύχομαι means
“I pray with,
” whereas συνεύχομαι means (a) “pray with, pray together” and
(b) “wish one well.
”12
Furthermore, we could say there is common prayer when:
• There is coincidence of place and time in prayer (a necessary, but
insufficient condition).
13
• There is a shared will toward the same purpose, viz. the performance
of prayer (a necessary and sufficient condition).
14 We participate in
the development of prayer with the use of a common manual of
worship (i.e. common contents of prayers or hymns, responses to the
petitions of the celebrant,
15 the wearing of liturgical vestments for
clergy) (a sufficient but not necessary condition).
In conclusion, common prayer is when with our whole manner (words,
actions, behavior) we seek to give others the impression that we desire to
participate in their worship.
In accordance with the above, then, common prayer does not occur when
a man visits or attends some religious service for merely scientific, touristic,
ceremonious, or social reasons.
16
The Sacred Canons on Common Prayer with Heretics
The universally valid17 holy canons of the Church which refer to the
prohibition of common prayer with heretics are the following:
1. Canon 10 of the Holy Apostles: “If any one shall pray, even in a
private house, with an excommunicated person, let him also be
excommunicated.
”18
2. Canon 11 of the Holy Apostles: “If anyone who is a clergyman pray
in company with a deposed clergyman, he shall be deposed too.
”
3. Canon 45 of the Holy Apostles: “Let any bishop, or presbyter, or
deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended, but if
he has permitted them to perform any service as clergymen, let him be
deposed.
”
4. Canon 65 of the Holy Apostles: “If any clergyman, or layman, enter
a synagogue of Jews, or of heretics, to pray, let him be both deposed
and excommunicated.
”
5. Canon 71 of the Holy Apostles: “If any Christian brings oil into a
temple of the heathen or into a synagogue of the Jews at their feasts,
or lights their lamps, let him be excommunicated.
”
6. Canon 6 of the the Local Council of Laodicea: “Regarding the
barring of heretics from the house of God while they yet remain in
heresy.
”
7. Canon 9 of the Local Council of Laodicea: “Concerning the fact
that those belonging to the Church must not be allowed to go visiting
the cemeteries of the so-called martyria [i.e., shrines of martyrs] of
any heretics, for the purpose of prayer or of cure; but, on the contrary,
those who do so, if they be among the faithful, shall be excluded from
communion for a time until they repent and confess their having made
a mistake, when they may be readmitted to communion.
”
8. Canon 32 of the Local Council of Laodicea: “That one must not
accept blessings of heretics, which are misfortunes rather than
blessings.
”
9. Canon 33 of the Local Council of Laodicea: “That one must not
join in prayer with heretics or schismatics.
”
10. Canon 34 of the Local Council of Laodicea: “That no Christian
should abandon the Martyrs of Christ and go away to the
pseudomartyrs, that is, of the heretics, or to the aforementioned
[heretics] themselves, becoming heretics; for these are alien to God.
Therefore let those that go unto them be anathema.
”
11. Canon 37 of the Local Council of Laodicea: “That one must not
accept holiday tokens sent by Jews or heretics, nor celebrate any
holiday along with them.
”
12. Canon 9 of Timothy of Alexandria: “Question: Whether a
Clergyman ought to pray when Arians or other heretics are present, or
it does not harm him at all, at a time when he himself is making the
prayer, that is to say, the offering? Answer: In the divine anaphora, or
offering, the Deacon addresses before the embrace the congregation,
saying: “Those of ye who are not in communion, take a walk.
” There
ought not, therefore, to be any persons present such as those
mentioned, unless they promise to repent and to leave the heresy.
”
13. Canon 2 of the Council of Antioch: “As for all those persons who
enter the church and listen to the sacred Scriptures, but who fail to
commune in prayer together and at the same time with the laity, or
who shun the participation of the Eucharist, in accordance with some
irregularity, we decree that these persons be outcasts from the Church
until, after going to confession and exhibiting fruits of repentance and
begging forgiveness, they succeed in obtaining a pardon. Furthermore,
we decree that communion with those excluded from communion is
not allowed, nor at private homes is it to be allowed to assemble and
pray with those who do not pray with the church, nor in another
church to admit those who have no admittance to another church. If
anyone among the Bishops, or Presbyters, or Deacons, or anyone of
the canon, should appear to be communing with those who have been
excluded from communion, he too is to be excluded from communion,
on the ground of seemingly confusing the Canon of the Church.
”
14. Canon 1 of the Fourth Ecumenical Council confirms the canons of
the local councils of Laodicea and Antioch and of St. Timothy of
Alexandria.
15. Canon 2 of the Sixth Ecumenical Council confirms the apostolic
canons and those of the local councils of Laodicea and Antioch and of
St. Timothy of Alexandria.
16. Canon 1 of the Seventh Ecumenical Council confirms the apostolic
canons and those of the local councils of Laodicea and Antioch and of
St. Timothy of Alexandria.
From a simple appeal to the canons, the following points become clear:
• For the Fathers, the matter of contact with heretics within the
frameworks of prayer and divine worship is especially critical from a
spiritual perspective. This is apparent from the large number of
canons dealing with this issue.
• The issue of common prayer with heretics has concerned the Church
throughout time. This is also why the related prohibitive canons cover
the entire period of time during which her Canon Law was being
compiled.
• Obviously, the violations of these canonical proscriptions have been
frequent. The Church, however, has remained steadfast, returning and
reaffirming these same prohibitions.
• The canonical proscriptions are clear, absolute, and categorical in the
prohibition of common prayer and worship with heretics or
schismatics.
“Excuses in Sins” and Common Prayers
To be sure, despite the clear and categorical prohibition against common
prayer with heretics or schismatics, a number of Orthodox participate—for
various reasons—in events of common prayer with heretics and especially in
our day with Roman Catholics and Protestants. But how will they get past the
well-established canonical order of the Church which forbids this behavior?
The “theological” justifications that they employ are mainly the
following:
1. 2. 3. 4. The Roman Catholics are not heretics but schismatics, so it is not
forbidden for us to have common worship with them.
19
When the canons refer to common prayer, they mean only the
participation in a “common Cup”
, or the participation of clergy
(Orthodox and heretics) in the Holy Eucharist; in other words, only
concelebration is prohibited.
20 Other common prayers are not
prohibited.
Within the context of pastoral discernment, the responsible shepherds
are justified in applying “ecclesiastical economia”21 and praying in
common with heretics.
Since they are no longer applied, the canons which forbid common
prayer with heretics have ceased to be in force and the Church should
therefore formally abolish them as well.
22
Chapter II
Papism Is a Heresy
The Teaching of the Saints Is Unanimous
IN REFERENCE TO THE FIRST SUPPOSED JUSTIFICATION, WE must note that our
Orthodox Church, as She expresses Herself through the unanimous opinion
of the Fathers (consensus patrum) and of distinguished canonists and
theologians and chiefly through the decisions of the Local Councils (with the
participation of all the Patriarchs of the East), from the period of the Schism
until today, accepts without any reservation that Papism is a heresy. The
following are characteristic examples.
Let it not escape us that “it is impossible to come to know the truth or to
grasp theology in any other way but by following the Saints.
”23
Photios the Great, Patriarch of Constantinople (9th c.): “Who then
shall stop his ears against this exceeding blasphemy [i.e. the Filioque], which
sets itself against the Gospels, rebels against the holy councils, rejects the
blessed and Holy Fathers… This blasphemous and God-embattling voice
takes up arms against all the prophets together, the apostles, hierarchs,
martyrs, and against the very words of the Master Himself… we condemned
these deceivers and enemies of God by a conciliar and divine vote.
24 And we
never ruled basing ourselves on our own judgements. We brought to light and
exhibited to all once again the condemnation set in place by the councils that
have met up to this day and by the apostolic institutions… Thus also with
them, since they remain in their multifarious delusion, we excluded them
from every Christian community… Their blasphemy against the Holy Spirit
alone…suffices to place them under myriads of anathemas… Let us cut off
from the body of the Church the gangrene of blasphemy…let us uproot the
shoots of evil.
”25
St. Germanos the New, Patriarch of Constantinople (13th c.),
recommends abstention from ecclesiastical communion with as many
Orthodox as communed with the heretical Latins.
26
St. Gregory Palamas (14th c.): “[They] will not profit at all, even if the
remedy for pseudodoxy were to be prepared and administered by the celestial
intellects themselves.
”27
St. Mark of Ephesus (1440): “Therefore we turned away from them as
from heretics and because of this we were separated… They are heretics, and
so as heretics we cut them off… So whence have they appeared to us being
suddenly Orthodox, they who have been judged as heretics for so many years
and by so many Fathers and teachers? …We must flee from them, flee from
these Christ-dealers and Christ-traders, as one flees from a snake.
”28 “We
have split ourselves off from the Latins for no other reason than the fact that
they are not only schismatics but also heretics.
”29
St. Symeon, Archbishop of Thessaloniki (15th c.), in his work Against
All Heresies characterizes the Westerners as [following] a heresy which
“sprouted up in the Church after the Seventh Ecumenical Council.
”30
St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite (18th c.): “The Latins are heretics.
”31
St. Cosmas of Aetolia (1779): “The Pope is one Antichrist” (8th
Teaching), and “Curse the Pope, for he will be the cause” (prophesy).
St. Nectarius, Bishop of Pentapolis (1920): “In saying that he is the
head of the Church, the Pope banished Christ from the Western Church…
This excessive arrogance of the Pope, this obsession of his with supreme
power gave birth to so many heresies.
”32
St. Justin Popovich, Professor of Dogmatics (1979): “In the history of
the human race, there are three main falls: that of Adam, that of Judas, that of
the Pope… Papism with its ethic is in many ways Arianism… The dogma of
the infallibility of the Pope is not only heresy but pan-heresy, since no other
heresy has ever so radically and so totally rebelled against the God-man
Christ and his Church as did Papism by way of the infallibility of the Pope, a
man. There is no doubt. This dogma is the heresy of heresies, an
unprecedented rebellion against the God-man Christ.
”33 “Roman Catholicism
is a multiple heresy… Did not St. Sava name Roman Catholicism a ‘Latin
heresy’ already in his own time, seven-and-a-half centuries ago? And, oh,
how many new dogmas has the Pope ‘infallibly’ dogmatized since then!”34
Distinguished Theologians, Canonists, and Clergy
Theodore Balsamon (12th c.): The Western Church “was separated going

Joseph, Patriarch of Constantinople (1430): “Therefore the Italians
have no good excuse for their delusion. They themselves have become
delusion and perdition for themselves. And not only do they blaspheme
against the Holy Spirit, but they practice every manner of impiety… Let us
therefore not pray in common with them… so that we may not also become
joined to the devil… For how can there be union for us when myriads of
dogmas come between us?”36
Joseph Bryennios (1431): “This [the Filioque] has given birth to every
parasynagogue. This introduced every heresy… It is contrary to the tradition
of all the saints and constitutes a rejection of the Orthodox faith.

“The difference of the Latins is a heresy, and our predecessors also held it to
be such.

Elder Philotheos Zervakos (1980): “Rebelling against the Holy Spirit…

heresies… I pray that the Grace of God may preserve you from the wolves,

Fr. John Romanides, Professor of Dogmatics (2001): “The Filioque is
a heresy regardless of any isolated opinion or expression of a Greek author
also, although there is not one Greek that said this.

Conciliar Condemnations of Papism as a Heresy
Council of 879, in Constantinople: The addition of the Filioque to the
Symbol of Faith is a heretical delusion. We must note that representatives of
all the Patriarchs and of the Pope of Rome participated in this Council, and its
decisions were accepted unanimously not only by the participants but also by
the fullness of the One and Indivisible Church. As a result, this Council has
all the marks of an ecumenical council. For this reason, in the conscience of
our Church it is considered the Eighth Ecumenical Council.
42
Council of 1170, in Constantinople: “They took counsel totally to cut
off with a total severance the Pope and all those with him… but they did not
hand them over to a total anathema, as with the other heresies, uttering the
apostolic expression,
‘A man that is an heretick after the first and second
admonition reject, knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth,
being condemned of himself.
’”43
Council of 1450, in Constantinople: (final council to be held in the holy
temple of Hagia Sophia): Condemnation of the uniat Council of Ferrara-
Florence and of the heretical teachings of the Latins.
44
Council of 1722, in Constantinople: “Drive away falsehood… Keep
away from the innovations and reforms of the Latins, who did not leave any
dogma or mystery or tradition of the Church incorrupt and unadulterated.
”45
Council of 1838, in Constantinople: “Let us guard the genuine children
of the Eastern Church from the blasphemies of Papism…from the chasms of
heresies and from the soul-destroying precipices of their papal delusion…that
ye may learn how great the difference is between us the Orthodox and the
Catholics, so that ye be not deceived henceforth by the sophistries and
innovations of these heretics…of this ill-conceived and satanic heresy of
theirs.
”46
Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem (1848):
“Arianism was once one of these heresies that were spread to a large portion
of the world, for reasons which the Lord knows. Such today is also Papism…
[The Filioque] is a heresy and those who believe it are heretics… For this
reason also the one, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, following in the
footsteps of the holy Fathers, eastern and western, declared both long ago in
the days of our Fathers and rules once again today in council… that it is a
heresy and its followers are heretics… Likewise, the congregations formed
by them are heretical and every spiritual communion of the Orthodox
children… with them is anticanonical, just as the 7th canon of the Third
Ecumenical Council determines.
”47
Council of 1895, in Constantinople: “There are substantial differences
which concern the God-given dogmas of our faith and the God-established
canonical regiment of the administration of the Churches… The Papist
Church… not only refuses to return to the canons and the terms of the
ecumenical councils, but at the end of the 19th century broadened the existing
chasm, officially proclaiming infallibility… The current Roman Church is a
church of innovations, of adulteration of the writings of the Fathers, of
misinterpretation of Scripture and the terms of the ecumenical councils.
Therefore it was reasonably and justly denounced and is still denounced, as
long as it remains in its delusion.
”48
In a praiseworthy book published by the Holy Monastery of Gregoriou,
49
the perspectives of a plethora of Saints and Teachers of our Church—more
than 40 persons—are recorded, who denounced the heretical papal
innovations. Indeed some of them gave even their blood for the Orthodox
Faith.
50 Moreover, besides the ecumenical councils, theologian Panagiotis
Simatis also cites many Local Councils of our Orthodox Church after the
Schism which condemn the heretical teachings of Papism: 1089, 1233, 1273,
1274, 1282, 1285, 1341, 1351, 1441, 1443, 1484, 1642, 1672, 1722, 1727,
1755, 1838, 1848, 1895, 1948.
51
Some, in their effort to characterize Papism as a mere schism, argue that
it is not a heresy since it has not been condemned by an ecumenical
council.
52 They wish to forget the express condemnation formulated at the
Council of 879, held in Constantinople. The idea that only the Seven
Ecumenical Councils (the last occurring in 787) delineate what is heresy is
foreign to Orthodox theology. The 15th canon of the First-Second Council
speaks of “some heresy condemned by the holy councils [author’s note: not
just the Ecumenical ones], or Fathers,
” whereas the ecclesiastical author
Vincent of Lerins (5th c.) is entirely clear: “if some theological question
should arise on which no conciliar decision has been given, one should then
have recourse to the opinions of the holy Fathers, especially of those who,
each in his own time and place, remaining in the unity of communion and of
the faith, were accepted as approved masters; and whatsoever these may be
found to have held, with one mind and with one consent, this ought to be
accounted the true and Catholic doctrine of the Church, without any doubt or
scruple.
”53
Furthermore, this notion is especially dangerous from an ecclesiological
perspective. Is it being implied that perhaps from A.D. 787 the Orthodox
Church ceased to be self-defined and to contrast Herself with delusion,
falsehood, and heresy? Does this view not steer immediately to a self-
negation of Orthodox Ecclesiology?
What would happen if this rationale—that since no ecumenical council
has pronounced judgement regarding Papism (which appeared in the 9th
century), therefore no Orthodox, and especially no responsible shepherd, has
the right to call it a heresy—were extended to other heresies? I wonder about
the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Mormons, the Pentecostals, televangelists, etc.
Which ecumenical council has pronounced judgement regarding them? Or
are they perhaps also not heretics?
Of course they are heretics, in other words outside of the “One, Holy
Catholic and Apostolic Church”
, since (a) they self-identify as non-Orthodox
and (b) they deny the experience and tradition of our Church, in other words,
Orthodox Theology, as it has been recorded in the decisions of the
Ecumenical and Local Councils, in the texts of the Fathers (consensus
Patrum) and in her liturgical life.
But is this not exactly what the Roman Catholics are doing? Do they not
believe contrary to those things that the ecumenical councils have decreed
(mainly the Second, but also the Third, Fourth, Sixth and Seventh)? Do they
not believe contrary to what our Orthodox Church teaches and lives? Do they
not identify themselves as non-Orthodox, as they do not accept our faith?
It is moreover for this reason—and I ask that we carefully consider this
point—that we do not have merely “a group of Orthodox that consider
Roman Catholics and Protestants to be heretics” or “only pronouncements by
particular ecclesiastical writers,
” as some erroneously contend,
54 but the
totality of the Saints of our Church who dealt with this issue unanimously
conclude that Papism is heresy. There is not one Saint of our Church—no,
not one—who contends that Papism is not a heresy.
If someone—whoever he may be—does not accept the clear and fixed
teaching of our Church and the unanimous opinion of our saints that Papism
is a heresy, this is a matter of his own personal choice and responsibility.
Perhaps he knows better than the Saints, perhaps he is higher than the
Councils, or has some private revelation, which grants him the right to decide
ex cathedra,
“infallibly” but also…arbitrarily!
Notwithstanding, even if the Papists were merely schismatics, common
prayer with them would still be prohibited according to the canons!55
Chapter III
“Common Prayer” Does Not Only Mean
“Concelebration”
LET US EXAMINE IN GREATER DETAIL the second justification, namely that when
the sacred canons refer to common prayer, they mean only participation in
the “Common Cup” of the Holy Eucharist or concelebration, in other words
the celebration of a common Divine Liturgy by an Orthodox clergyman
together with a heretic.
The Meaning of συνεύχεσθαι in the Holy Scriptures and
Tradition
We have already mentioned the meaning of συνεύχεσθαι in secular literature
and in the Fathers. Let us note here that the New Testament only contains the
verb εὔχεσθαι, which never refers to the Divine Liturgy but rather only to
prayer or to a simple wish.
56 The use of this word in the translation of the Old
Testament by the Seventy (Septuagint) is also similar.
Consequently, there is no basis in Scripture or in the patristic or secular
literature for the interpretation that συνεύχομαι or συμπροσεύχομαι have the
exclusive meaning not of participation in mere common prayer but of
celebration of the Divine Eucharist.
Also, by carefully examining the holy canons themselves, it becomes
abundantly clear that the Fathers forbade not only participation in common
Holy Communion but also simple prayer alongside heretics.
When Canon 10 of the Holy Apostles calls for the excommunication of
anyone that “shall pray, even in a private house,
” with an excommunicate
(whether a heretic or an excommunicated person), it obviously refers to mere
common prayer and not to the Divine Liturgy, since performing the Divine
Liturgy in a house is strictly forbidden according to Canon 58 of the Council
of Laodicea.
57 Therefore, to “pray even in a private house” means any form
of simple common prayer. The violator of this canon is to “be
excommunicated”! Canon 45 of the Holy Apostles is clear and totally
distinguishes common prayer with heretics from the performance of priestly
duties of any kind, including Holy Communion: “Let any bishop, or
presbyter, or deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended,
but if he has permitted them to perform any service as clergymen, let him be
deposed.
” Moreover, the subsequent apostolic canon (46) comments on the
“Holy Communion” of heretics, specifying that whoever accepts it should be
excommunicated, for “what consonancy hath Christ with Belial? or what part
hath the believer with an infidel?”
When Canon 65 of the Holy Apostles forbids entry into a Jewish or
heretical assembly with the aim of prayer (“to pray”), it certainly does not
mean participation in a common Holy Eucharist and in a “common Cup,
”
since the Holy Eucharist is never done in the Jewish synagogue, neither can
there be a “Common Cup.
” It clearly refers to mere prayer, which it prohibits.
Only St. Timothy of Alexandria in his 9th canon identifies “prayer” with
the Holy Eucharist. Yet even here, because he confines the meaning of
“prayer” only to the Divine Liturgy, he feels the need to clarify: “when he
himself is making the prayer, that is to say, the offering.
” In any case, it must
be emphasized that this canon which speaks of the eucharistic prayer does not
refer to concelebration but rather to the mere presence of heretics in the
Divine Liturgy, which it expressly prohibits: “There ought not, therefore, to
be any such persons present.
”
Besides this simple approach to the texts of the holy canons themselves,
all the distinguished canonists acknowledge that, according to the canons, not
only is participation in common prayer prohibited when Holy Communion is
offered, but all kinds of prayer with heretics are prohibited for Orthodox
clergy and laymen.
Theodore Balsamon58
“Understand συνεύξασθαι as meaning simply to associate and to be more
gently disposed toward the prayer of the heretics. For we ought to loathe such
men as unclean things, and certainly not to make them our friends.
”59
“The canon is clear. For it does not allow heretics remaining in heresy to
attend church alongside the Orthodox.
”60
“When you hear the canon saying that the bishops and all the other
ordained ranks that pray with excommunicates are to be excommunicated, do
not say in contrast that the laymen that disobey this canon are innocent. For
these shall also be excommunicated according to the 10th apostolic canon
which does not distinguish between clergy and laity.
”61
“A heretic is he who…even unto a small degree diverges from the
Orthodox faith. Since at least all those enumerated in the present question
[Latins, Armenians, Monothelites, Nestorians] were alienated from the
Church of the Orthodox to no small extent but rather to an inescapably large
degree, in no wise will they be allowed to commune with us, not even for the
sake of becoming godparents of spiritual children, which is done through the
intercessions of holy prayers and many holy things; lest we ourselves be also
condemned to excommunication according to the canon which says,
“He that
communes with the excommunicate is himself an excommunicate.
”62
The following is the fifteenth question of His Holiness Mark, Patriarch of
Alexandria: “Is there no danger in celebrating or praying alongside heretics,
namely with Jacobites and Nestorians, in their churches or in ours? Or in the
partaking of a common table with them? Or in making them sponsors at Holy
Baptism? Or in conducting memorials for their departed? For the narrowness
of this land gives rise to many such cases, and I ask what we should do.
”
In response, Theodore Balsamon enumerates the canons that forbid
common prayer with heretics, and then adds,
“For this reason, we also vote
that both the laymen and the clergymen that pray in common with heretics
within a church of the Orthodox or of heretics, or pray with them in any place
in a priestly fashion, or even eat with them, be subjected not only to
excommunication and deposition but also be punished in ways greater still, in
accordance with the summary of the said divine canons. For the narrowness
of these lands and the multiplication of the heretics has not changed the
integrity of the Orthodox faith.
”63
“So if the catechumens are not permitted to remain when the divine
sacrifice is being performed, how can heretics be allowed to remain, if they
have not expressly sworn to repent and put off their heresy? And even then, I
think, they should be permitted to be not within the temple but without, with
the catechumens. If, however, they fail to disavow the heresy, neither should
they be found among the catechumens, but they are to be put out of the
Church altogether.
”64
John Zonaras
“Τhe heretics and their ceremonies must be loathed by the Orthodox. Or
rather, they are to be corrected and instructed by the bishops and
presbyters.
”65
“The canon considers it a great sin for a Christian to enter into a
synagogue of the Jews or a church of the heretics for prayer; for what does
Christ have in common with Belial? Or what portion do believers have with
unbelievers, according to the great Apostle?… And neither should the
Orthodox honour the assembly of the heretics, since it advocates things
opposite to the Orthodox; nay, they should rather even despise it. So then
some say that the canon subjects to a double penalty those entering into such
congregations for to pray, as thereby greatly sinning.
”66
“He who prays in common with one excommunicated or one deposed
according to the extant canons is under penance…for even if he does not
believe their beliefs, nevertheless he is at least giving many a cause for
scandal and creates against himself the suspicion that he honours the Jewish
rituals. At the same time it is also believed that he is defiling himself by
associating with them.
”67
“Those who fall into heresies and remain in them are thus ostracized from
the Church as being alien to her. How then can they be permitted to enter into
the house of God?”68
Alexios Aristenos
“
…Whoever has entered into a synagogue of Jews or heretics and prayed
[προσευξάμενος] with them.
”69
“For heretics the holy altar is off-limits. It is impermissible for heretics to
enter into the house of God.
”70
“There can be no communion between light and darkness. For this reason,
neither is a Christian to celebrate together with heretics nor Jews.
”71
“Pray not in common with heretics or schismatics. He that prays with
them is excommunicated.
”72
Matthew Blastaris
The 33rd (canon of Laodicea) totally forbids us from praying with a heretic
or a schismatic.
”73
“The 2nd canon of the Council of Antioch commands us entirely to stand
afar off from communion with excommunicates, and to pray together with
them neither in a house nor in a church.
”74
St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite
“The present [45th apostolic] canon prescribes that any Bishop, or Presbyter,
or Deacon that shall only join in prayer, and not co-officiate in divine
services, with any heretics is to be suspended. For anyone that prays in
company with excommunicates (as heretics are) must himself be
excommunicated along with them, according to the tenth canon of the same
Apostles. But if he went so far as to allow those heretics to perform any
service in church as Clergymen, he is to be deposed from office altogether.
For any Clergyman that officiates at services in company with others who
have been deposed (as have heretics, according to the second and fourth
canons of the Third Ecumenical Council) is himself ipso facto deposed along
with them, according to the eleventh canon of the Apostles.

Photios the Great, Patriarch of Constantinople
Nomocanon, Title 3, Ch. 15, and Title 12, Ch. 1-18.
76
St. Nikephorus the Confessor, Patriarch of Constantinople
“It is not befitting to enter into such churches [belonging to heretics] at all,
for the aforementioned purposes [namely for prayers and psalmody]… For as
soon as heresy was introduced, the guardian angel thereof has left it,
according to the witness of St. Basil the Great, and such a temple is
henceforth a common house. And it is written,
‘I will not enter into the
congregation of evil-doers,
’”77 while the Apostle says,
78 ‘what agreement
hath the temple of God with idols?’”79
Germanos II, Patriarch of Constantinople (1240)
“For this reason do I adjure all the laity, as many of you as are genuine
children of the Catholic Church, to flee entirely from those priests that have
fallen under the latin subjection and not even to congregate with them in
church, nor to accept a chanced-upon blessing from their hands. For it is
better to pray to God in your homes by yourselves than gather in churches
with the latin-minded.
”80
Cyril V, Patriarch of Constantinople (1749)
“We command and order paternally and spiritually… from henceforth do not
dare at all to commune together with the aforementioned friars and
francopriests and the rest of the Westerners in the sacred Mysteries of our
Church and in the rest of the ecclesiastical rituals, prayers, and ceremonies,
but to wholly preserve… your non-communion from them in all the sacred
rituals and ceremonies. Should, however, after our patriarchal and synodal
chastisement and this paternal and spiritual counsel and advice, anyone of
you dare to seem disobedient and opposed, or should one of the
aforementioned priests dare and be caught praying together with the Latins or
accepting their offerings or celebrating commemorations on their behalf…
such a priest will be submitted to utter revocation of his priesthood.
”81
Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, & Jerusalem (1848)
“[The Church] rules once again today in council… that [Papism] is a
heresy and its followers are heretics… Likewise the congregations formed by
them are heretical and every spiritual communion of the Orthodox children…
with them is anticanonical, just as the 7th canon of the Third Ecumenical
Council determines.
”82
St. Justin Popovich
“The sacred canon of the Holy Apostles does not specify exactly which
prayer or service is prohibited, but it prohibits all common prayer with
heretics, even private prayer (“συνευξάμενος”). Are not greater and broader
things than these being committed during ecumenistic common prayers?…Is
it perhaps not the case…that blessings are being given by heretical Roman
Catholic bishops and priests, Protestant pastors, and even women?”83
Athenagoras, Patriarch of Constantinople
“It is a necessity for Orthodox clerical representatives to be as hesitant as
possible in the liturgical gatherings with the heterodox as being antithetical to
the holy canons and dulling the confessional sensitivity of the Orthodox, and
strive to perform, if possible, purely Orthodox services and ceremonies, that
the splendour and majesty of Orthodox worship may thus be presented before
the eyes of the heterodox.
”84
Patriarch Athenagoras makes the following points with exceptional
clarity:
• Clergy that take part in dialogue must be as hesitant as possible in
common liturgical gatherings with the heterodox.
• Common liturgical gatherings are antithetical to the holy canons.
• Common liturgical gatherings dull the confessional sensitivity of the
Orthodox.
• Purely Orthodox services should be performed.
• The splendor and grandeur of our worship should be presented to the
heterodox.
Refusal of Common Prayer Does Not Equate to Hatred or
Aversion
I chose to close this exemplar list of references and interpretations of the holy
canons with the view of one of the pioneers of the Ecumenical Movement,
Patriarch Athenagoras, who is anything but a fanatic or a zealot, so that it
may become even clearer that the observance of exactitude,
85 in other words,
the refusal of common prayer with heretics…
• Does not equate to hatred or aversion toward the person of the
heretics.
86
• Does not equal a denial of practical love87 or aid to anyone, regardless
of his religious views. It is characteristic that all of the monasteries of
the Holy Mountain88 which apply exactitude to the matter of common
prayer with heretics are equally hospitable both to heterodox and to
Orthodox visitors, both of whom receive identical treatment,
89 with
the exception that the heterodox are forbidden from common prayer
either in the holy temple or in the common refectory. In the final
analysis, we are not Christians if we do not love the “other,
” whoever
he might be, even our own enemy or an enemy of Christ.
90
• It does not amount to narcissism and arrogance, that is, that we are
somehow better than others. Such a notion is foreign to Orthodox
teaching and contrary to the ecclesiastical ethos and mindset.
• It does not mean a cessation of theological dialogue with heretics.
When the Church judges that all the preconditions have been met in
order for Her to give Her witness and make a call to repentance and
return, She cannot but participate in theological dialogues, without
however deviating from Her canonical order through common
prayers.
91 It must be made entirely clear that common prayers are not
a component of the process of inter-Christian dialogue.
• It does not mean cessation of cooperation over common social or
political problems.
Eugenios Voulgaris is unequivocal: “Abstention from [heretics] involves
solely spiritual matters. As regards other matters we are to deal with them
charitably in all freedom in external intercourse and fellowship, keeping
every human right and duty in relation to them…. Flee only from spiritual
communion with them, although the political life requires of you to preserve
the secular familiarity and contact.
”92
This, then, is the stance of the Church by exactitude on the matter of
common prayer with heretics. Do we have the right—if we wish to live a
consistent Christian life—to ignore the tradition and centuries-long life of our
Church?
Chapter IV
Common Prayer by Economia?93
IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPHS, WE SAW THAT ACCORDING TO the practice of the
Church by exactitude, common prayer with heretics or schismatics is totally
impermissible, while the penalties laid out by the holy canons for violators
are very severe, namely, deposition for the clergy and excommunication (in
other words severing from the body of the Church) for the laity.
Nevertheless,
“ecclesiastical matters are considered in two ways, by
exactitude and by economia: when they cannot be carried out by exactitude,
then they happen by economia,
” Patriarch of Jerusalem Dositheos94 explains,
summarizing the age-old pastoral tradition of our Church.
This, then, begs the question: could perhaps common prayer be
sometimes permissible by economia, without there being a violation of the
holy canons and without facing canonical consequences?
Ecclesiastical Economia and the Presuppositions for Its
Application
According to Ieronymos Kotsonis, professor of Canon Law and subsequently
Archbishop of Athens,
“economia is the occasional temporary or permanent
deviation from exactitude, in times of need and for the greater benefit of
certain members or of the whole Church, in accordance with certain
presuppositions, as long as piety and dogmatic integrity remain unharmed.
”95
In other words, economia is a principle of Canon Law which “seeks not to
dissolve canonical order or the tradition of the Church in general, but in the
final analysis instead seeks to contribute to the consolidation thereof.
”96 It is
therefore not a rejection or denial of canonical order, a violation of the holy
canons or arbitrariness97 but rather “a fruit of the pastoral and therapeutic
ministry of the Church.
”98 In fact its use is not confined to the limits of
Canon Law, since it is very broad, dating as far back as the Apostolic Era,
and is to be found across the entire spectrum of Church life (worship,
administration, pastoral care).
99 The boundaries of its application include
matters “in which piety is not damaged,
”100 and according to Eulogius of
Alexandria,
“when the dogma of piety is in no wise harmed. There is no
room for condescension in matters of the Orthodox faith…for as the dogma is
retained undefiled and uncorrupted, economia finds place to exist with regard
to some of the things that are outside of dogma.
”101
Ecclesiastical economia stems from the spirit of love and of the mercy of
God toward man and is founded upon the Divine Incarnation and the whole
redemptive work of our Lord Jesus Christ.
102 In fact St. Nicholas the Mystic,
Patriarch of Constantinople, broadens economia by saying,
“Economia is an
imitation of divine philanthropy, which snatches out of the mouth of the beast
howling against us him that is about to be swallowed by its destructive
mouth.
”103
Despite its widespread use, however, there are no specific canons about
its application;104 there is only a framework within which the one practicing
economia must act.
105 There is the grave danger of very easily falling into
arbitrariness and violation of ecclesiastical order because of carelessness or
even intentionally, resulting in serious consequences for ecclesiastical life.
Professor Amilkas Alivizatos makes the following note on this: “Not
infrequently [economia] lead to condemnable abuses, which no doubt cause
much damage to the Church; this abuse often results in scandal and the
consequent upheaval of Christian society.
”106
In summary, we may say that in order for economia to be applied the
following conditions must be met:
1. There must be an undeniable need, such that the withholding of its
application would cause great spiritual harm,
107 or there should be the
pursuit of benefit for the members or the whole Church which would
otherwise not be possible to achieve, since “in applying economia the
Church anticipates the greatest possible spiritual benefit achievable
through its use.
”108 Cyril IV, Patriarch of Antioch, notes,
“Spiritual
leaders make occasional use of economia and condescension out of
necessity, in matters in which piety is not damaged, so as to avoid
greater evils and the subsequent ruin of soul which lies in wait for
Christians. And this, again, must be done with precise aim and for as
2. 3. long as economia and condescension are necessary and reasonable,
lest [economia] become as it were a paralysis and inversion in the
written legal ordinances and the Church traditions and custom that
have prevailed, and consequently a stumbling-block and perdition.
”109
Those acting according to economia are obliged to act “with
complete consciousness that this constituted a deviation from
exactitude.
”110 This means that the use of economia does not create a
“customary” or “practical” canon law which would supplant
exactitude.
111 Consequently, with economia, the full force of the holy
canons is not ignored but rather bolstered and upheld: “he who
ventures forth into ‘ecclesiastical economia’ does so maintaining
undiminished respect for the existing ecclesiastical order…This
explains the efforts of those truly acting within economia to
emphasize that the measures undertaken by them do not harm the
authority of the holy canons and the patristic ordinances.
”112 When
economia is administered in writing it is customary to include within
the written document the exact (by exactitude) stance of the Church
on the matter, as well as the reasons justifying the temporary deviation
therefrom.
113 As a consequence of the above, the one enacting
economia is obliged to have understanding and render the necessary
respect toward those desiring exactitude. It is inconceivable for those
requesting exactitude to be stigmatized with extreme characterizations
solely on those grounds, while conversely, according to Ecumenical
Patriarch Bartholomew,
114 “the Church as a genuine mother ‘praises
strongly those who desire to live by exactitude,
’” in the words of St.
Cyril of Alexandria.
115 In contrast, when the above precondition is not
met,
“if anyone should undermine any of the decisions of the God-
bearing Fathers, this must be called not economia but rather a
violation and betrayal of dogma and impiety toward things Divine,
”
says St. Eulogius of Alexandria categorically.
116
In order for the deviation from exactitude to be considered
ecclesiastical economia it must be carried out with great consideration
and sensitivity117 so as not to create more problems in the Body of the
Church than those it seeks to heal.
118
4. Lastly, it is absolutely mandatory for the conscience of the Church to
accept such a deviation from exactitude as being truly done by
economia, because the final earthly judge of all decisions of
ecclesiastical bodies is “the common conscience of the Church,
”119
both the clergy and the people. According to Basil the Great “The
economias done in regard to the churches are done by those entrusted
with the protection thereof, but are affirmed by the people.
”120 Let not
what Patriarch Bartholomew emphasizes escape us, that the
conscience of the Church “is higher even than the ecumenical council
itself”
121 and for this reason it characterized even those councils that
,
had nonetheless fulfilled all other criteria for to be considered
ecumenical (cf. Ferrara-Florence) as robber councils and void.
“Higher than the jurisdiction granted by the laws and the sacred
canons is the moral jurisdiction of the entire fullness of the Church,
which cannot be bribed… Ordinances which stipulate actions by
economian on the part of the Church…must be in harmony with the
conscience of the catholic Church, which, being guided by the Holy
Spirit, is in this case also the supreme tribunal for ‘ecclesiastical
economia’ on earth.
”122 The following words of Ecumenical Patriarch
Demetrios summarise the ecclesiastical tradition: “The final
judgement of all things which take place within dialogue and of what
will be finally achieved belongs on the one hand to the Churches, as
being administering and decreeing instruments of divine inspiration,
but also to the faithful people of God himself. With the infallible
criterion of his faith and the joint witness of his conscience, this
people accepts the God-pleasing decisions but rejects those that are
not constructed in a manner befitting God.
”123
A good illustration of this is the case of Germanos II, Patriarch of
Constantinople (1222-1240). The Patriarchal Synod wanted to appear lenient
for the time and allow the Cypriot hierarchy to conform to certain terms of
the Latin occupiers of Cyprus, doing so on the basis of economia. As soon as
the decision was made known, crowds of enraged clergy, monastics, and
laymen stormed the meeting hall of the convening synod, declaring that they
considered conforming to the terms of the Latins to be a denial of the Faith
and demanding a revocation of the decision. Honoring the conscience of the
faithful, the Patriarchal Synod recalled its decision taken “by economia”!124
It is therefore totally clear that when the aforementioned preconditions are
not met we have “counterfeit,
”125 “misplaced,
”126 “bad and contrived”
economia: “Do not any longer acknowledge [this as] a mode of economia but
rather as a judgement-debt for lawlessness and for violation of the divine
canons,
” according to the venerable Theodore the Studite.
127
Common Prayer with Heretics and Ecclesiastical Economia
It has already been mentioned that economia is not only limited to the
internal life of the Church; rather, as Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew
points out,
“the issue of economia is not simply a matter of the discipline and
order of Canon Law, but has a theological and especially ecclesiological
dimension which cannot at all be overlooked. Within the bounds of this
ecclesiological dimension of economia we seek to apply it in the relations of
the Orthodox Church towards those Christians outside of it.
”128
Of course, within the confines of this present work it is not possible to
fully examine the question of ecclesiastical economia in inter-Christian
relations (e.g. the recognition of “sacraments,
”129 intercommunion, reception
of heretics, reunification in the one Church, definition of dogmas); we shall
instead limit ourselves strictly to the question of whether or not common
prayer with the heterodox is permissible.
In examining the relevant texts of the Fathers of the Church and of the
distinguished canonists, we clearly see that they are especially willing to
apply economia in many forms when a heretic renounces his delusion and
wishes to return to the Church,
130 whereas conversely they are exceptionally
cautious and even totally refuse the use of economia for common prayer with
heretics.
In fact they are much more strict and categorical in their prohibition
against the entry of the Orthodox into a temple of heretics for common prayer
under any circumstances or necessities, while some are somewhat
condescending and permit heretics to be present in Orthodox worship by
economia, when they come with reverence and a disposition to become
acquainted with it. Nevertheless, never under any circumstances do they
accept any participation of heretics in the liturgical practice (neither as
celebrants nor as speakers). This accommodating stance (by economia) on the
part of the Orthodox shepherds has a purely pastoral aim: “[We are] setting
forth economia so as not to strike down but rather win over the brethren
quietly and gradually, on whose behalf our common Savior and Master
poured out His own blood.
”131
Let us examine some cases in greater detail:
Does perhaps “the narrowness of this land” permit by
economia common prayer with heretics?
“No!” says Theodore Balsamon, Patriarch of Antioch and “most renowned
exegete of the sacred canons.
”132 In response to a question by Mark,
Patriarch of Alexandria, as to whether by reason of “the narrowness of this
land”
, in other words, the lack of a sufficient number of Orthodox Churches
and an overwhelming majority population of heretics, there is “no danger in
celebrating or praying alongside heretics…in their churches or in ours”
,
Balsamon, citing Canons 64 of the Holy Apostles and 6, 33, and 34 of
Laodicea, emphasizes,
“Anathema be the ones that go to them. For this
reason, we also vote that both the laymen and the clergymen that pray in
common with heretics within a church of the Orthodox or of heretics, or pray
with them in any place in a priestly fashion…be subjected not only to
excommunication and deposition but also be punished in ways greater still, in
accordance with the summary of the said divine canons”; and he concludes:
“For the narrowness of these lands and the multiplication of the heretics has
not changed the integrity of the Orthodox faith.
”133
When there is no Orthodox Church is common prayer with
heretics permitted by economia?
“No!” responds Nikephorus the Confessor, Patriarch of Constantinople,
proposing a way out from the problem of the nonexistence of Orthodox
churches; if there is need, he permits the use of a temple consecrated by
heretics, but such a temple is to be considered a “common house”: “We
recommend that you enter the churches consecrated by heretics as if entering
into a common house; that you enter out of need and chant, having first
fastened a cross in the middle. Into the altar, however, neither enter nor
cense, nor perform any prayer, nor light any candle or lamp.
”134 It readily
follows that he allows not common prayer with heretics but merely the use of
their temple as though it were a plain space, for the performing of Orthodox
services. This practice is carried out today in the diaspora, where heterodox
houses of worship are used but with the use of a holy antimension for the
performing of the Orthodox Divine Liturgy, as would also be done “in a
common house, out of need.
”
Perhaps “under pressure of force” common prayer with
heretics is permitted by economia?
“No!” asserts Nikephorus Gregoras (14th c.). In response to the question of
his pupil Agathangelus,
“whether it be allowed…to pray with some of the
heterodox under pressure of force…since both here and there the same
prayers are said,
” he responds emphatically,
“It is better to offer genuine
hymns to the Lord outdoors or in a wilderness or on mountains rather than
have communion with impious men in temples adorned with gold and
glistening slabs of marble.
”135
St. John Climacus encourages those Christians that are “strong, warm,
and firm in the Faith,
” and who are invited by heretics that respect and revere
them, to maintain contact with the said heretics by economia and even to eat
with them, with the higher aim of benefitting them.
136 He does not, however,
make any reference to the use of economia in common prayer with heretics.
In which cases is the presence of the Orthodox in the temples of
the heretics and participation in their services permitted by
economia?
As has been already mentioned, it is forbidden to enter into the temples of
heretics “to pray” or “for the purpose of prayer or of cure” (Canon 65 of the
Holy Apostles and 9 of Laodicea); which is to say that, not only by economia
but even by exactitude, it is not forbidden “for simple members of the
Orthodox Church to attend the worship of the heterodox, [which] could also
be interpreted as an act of goodwill”137 or done only for ceremonial or social
reasons.
St. Nikephorus the Confessor relates that it is permitted to enter into
“cemeteries of saints,
” that is into shrines of martyrs, even if they are
occupied by heretics at the time, for the veneration of holy relics but not for
common prayer with heretics,
“provided that you enter out of necessity, only
to venerate the relics of the saint.
”138
The spiritual father of Gregory (a member of the Orthodox representation
at the Council of Ferrara-Florence) says characteristically: “When I enter into
a church of the Latins, I do not venerate any of their saints since I do not
recognize any of them. Perhaps I only recognize Christ, but I know not how
He is depicted; nevertheless I make the sign of the Cross and venerate. So I
am venerating the Cross which I myself make and not some other thing of
those there in my sight.
”139
We reiterate that, whereas the canonical tradition of our Church
categorically rejects the participation of the Orthodox in the worship of the
heretics, it is nonetheless more accommodating to the entry of heretics into
Orthodox churches by economia.
As has been said, exact practice requires that only her own members and
not the unbaptized or heretics take part in the liturgical practice of our
Church. By economia, however, it has been permitted for heretics and even
non-Christians to attend Orthodox worship—and even the Divine Liturgy—
when there is on their part a desire to become acquainted with the liturgical
life of our Church. The most characteristic example of this is when the
representation of the idolatrous Russians attended the Divine Liturgy in the
Church of Holy Wisdom in Constantinople and the subsequent
Christianization of the entire Russian people, according to the Russian
Primary Chronicle.
Further, St. John Chrysostom invited the heretics into the church where
he was speaking in the hope that they would return to the truth of the Church:
“Call the heretic hither to me, both if he be present and if he be not; for if he
be present, let him be instructed by our voice; and if he be not, let him learn
by listening to you.
”140 It is obvious that he is not inviting him for common
prayer, nor so that the heretic can preach to the faithful…
Broadening the aforementioned suggestion of St. Nikephorus the
Confessor regarding entry into heretical churches for the veneration of holy
relics, we can accept that it is permissible for heretics to enter into Orthodox
churches for the veneration of holy relics which we keep and which they also
revere. A theoretical ban on entry for the veneration of relics would be a far
cry from the authentic ecclesiastical spirit. And certainly, when the heterodox
“return” holy relics to our Church, hospitality and indeed thanksgiving
demand that they be present (by economia) in the relevant church events, of
course without any active liturgical participation in our Orthodox worship.
On occasions when the heretics come to the Church with reverence
asking for a blessing and seeking to attend our Orthodox worship, Gennadius
Scholarius, Patriarch of Constantinople,
141 and Dositheos, Patriarch of
Jerusalem,
142 and Demetrius Chomatianos, Archbishop of Ochrid,
143 suggest
that we not send them away but rather offer them even antidoron144 and holy
water. It is characteristic that, whereas Gennadius allows the Orthodox to
give a blessing to heretics, he forbids them from asking for the blessing or the
holy water of the heretics.
“It is sufficient that you not ask for holy water
from them, since they are set apart as heterodox.
” Feeling the need to justify
his suggestion, Demetrius of Ochrid is clear as to what end he has in view:
“This habit has power to entirely attract them by gradual steps to our holy
customs and dogmas.
”145
Some cite the above opinions of Gennadius, Patriarch of Constantinople,
and Dositheos, Patriarch of Jerusalem, in their attempt to find some support,
however small, in the life of our Church which could “justify” the
contemporary practice of common prayers with heretical leaders. A careful
examination of these texts, however, does not support such a possibility: the
above patriarchs speak only of the mere presence of heretical faithful—not
leaders—in Orthodox worship. Gennadius indeed refers to pilgrims passing
through (religious tourism in the 15th century!). Nowhere is it implied that
heretics and indeed the primates of the heresies can participate actively in the
worship of our Church by wearing vestments or preaching. Nowhere is it
implied that it is permissible for Orthodox to take part in the worship of
heretics. Nowhere is it implied that there can be cooperation between
Orthodox and heretics for the composition of an “interconfessional common
prayer!” And chiefly, it is expressly stated that it is impermissible for
Orthodox to ask for the blessing of heretics.
Additionally, the opinion that “Gennadius reckons as common prayer
only eucharistic communion”146 can not be supported by the texts of
Scholarius.
Another case in which heretics are allowed by economia to participate in
an Orthodox service is when an Orthodox priest by economia performs the
funeral service and buries a heterodox, in the absence of shepherds of the
same confession as the reposed,
147 and also in the mystery of Marriage, when
one of the spouses happens to be heterodox (the so-called mixed
marriages).
148
Of course, with the change in social conditions, the attendance of
heterodox at Orthodox services in parishes is today all the more observable.
The following thoughts of the ever-memorable Fr. Epiphanios
Theodoropoulos make for the most fitting response on the part of the
responsible pastors: “It would be advisable perhaps for there to be on the
door of the church a small sign which would read,
‘During worship, the
heterodox may not enter.
’ If, despite this, a heretic should wish to enter,
certainly we would not then interrupt worship, nor would we call the police.
We would continue our worship and after its conclusion we would approach
the heterodox person and with politeness we would tell him what the relevant
holy canons of the Orthodox Church say, and we would point out to him that
he ought to show due respect for them. We ourselves shall never go into a
heterodox church during worship, observing the holy canons on this point
with total exactitude. Regarding the entry of the heterodox into our churches,
however, a bit of flexibility in the spirit of ecclesiastical economia does no
harm.
”149
Exceptions in the Canonical Tradition
An exception to the unanimous stance of ecclesiastical writers regarding the
prohibition by economia or by exactitude of common prayer with heretics are
the canonists of the end of the 12th Century, Demetrius Chomatianos (or
Chomatenos), Archbishop of Ochrid, and John of Kitros. More specifically:
According to Demetrius Chomatianos150
1. 2. The ordination of an Orthodox clergyman by a heretical bishop is
acceptable: “Heretics’ ordinations are acceptable to the Orthodox,
according to the tradition of the Fathers, when those being ordained
either are Orthodox or become such”!
It is not at all problematic for Orthodox clergy or laity to pray in the
churches of the Latins or to give honorable veneration to their saints:
“wherein [in the temples of the Latins] our own, whether of the ranks
of clergy or of the laity, enter and offer prayers unto God, and to the
saints commemorated therein they offer the relative honor and
veneration; and they are under no condemnation because of this, that
is, for being in the temples that are under the Latins.
”
3. 4. The opinion that it is not permissible to give Holy Communion to
Latins (which Balsamon supports) is not acceptable as “being
exceedingly relentless and insolent and unduly censuring the Latin
types and habits.
”
The Common Cup is not proposed, since “it will prove impossible for
each party to violate its familiar habits,
” which is to say, it is merely
an issue of differing customs and nothing more…
Justification for Chomatianos’s Stance
Chomatianos presents as acceptable the opinion that the only serious
difference with the Latins is “the innovation within the Symbol of Faith,
which they created.
” For him, the remaining differences fall under the
category of “customs that became established in the western churches…none
of which are sufficient to separate us.
”151
It is obvious, then, that even though he is especially strict with regard to
the error of the Filioque, he does not consider the Latins to be heretics,
152
since “many of those in high repute…say that these things were not examined
conciliarly. Neither were they publicly declared expelled as heretics. But they
eat and pray with us.
” For Chomatianos, these merely constitute
inconsequential differences of custom which some justify “on account of the
unbending mindset of [that] people”153 or “knowing the harshness and
arrogance of [that] people and its infection by barbarian (for the most part)
”154
customs.
These opinions of Chomatianos constitute the theological foundation of
his accommodating stance toward the Latins.
155 It is worth noting, however,
that he does not base them on the canons and Church Tradition, but calls
instead upon the opinions of others whom he does not in fact name, save for
Theophylact of Bulgaria:156 “yet some have treated this subject with more
clemency [φιλανθρωπότερον],
” “wherein our own…enter,
” “many of those in
high repute.
” While he himself accepts the views of “those in high repute”
and founds his syllogism on their basis, he nevertheless does not appear to
rest fully at ease. For that reason he often takes refuge in “ecclesiastical
economia” and considers it necessary to justify his position with an additional
argument that is nevertheless contradictory:
Since the Latins are not heretics and their customs are acceptable, for
what reason, when the bishop is invited and goes, will he “not prejudge the
hierarch, as one entrusted with and practicing the economia that befits
stewards [oikonomous] of souls”?
Since the Latins are not heretics, what meaning does the last phrase have
with which he concludes the related responses,
“extending economia so as
not to cast down but rather win over the brethren peaceably and gradually”?
It is obvious that, in citing economia to justify liturgical contacts with the
Latins, in effect he grants that the Latins are, if not heretics, at least
schismatics, since in any other circumstance there would be no canonical
problem requiring the medicine of economia!
Also worth mentioning is the observation of Chomatianos that “there are
found among the Latins some who differ not at all from us in their customs,
namely the dogmatic and ecclesiastical customs, and who in this respect are,
as one might say, intermediates.
”157 He also mentions that the Latins who
come to the Divine Liturgy of the Orthodox asking “to receive the leavened
holy offering from us, make it clear that, were they not despising their own
practice of unleavened bread and considering it of no great importance to
cherish it, they would not be coming to the holy oblation that takes place
among us.
”158 Obviously, according to Chomatianos, in his era (end of the
12th century) contact had not yet been totally cut off between East and West,
and their heresy and separation from the Body of the Catholic Church had not
been solidified in the conscience of the Latins,
159 or at least there were well-
founded hopes for the reunification of what had been made separate. So in
the case of these “intermediates” and of those that “despised the unleavened
bread”
, Chomatianos proposes according to economia that blessed bread
(antidoron) be given and that the Orthodox hierarch go to their gatherings.
Despite all this, he certainly feels the need to justify this suggestion of his
saying that “this habit has power to entirely attract them by gradual steps to
our holy customs and dogmas.
”160 The aim, then, of the economia which he
recommends and which was followed by “many of those in high repute” is to
win over those for whom the error and heresy had not yet been solidified and
who were “intermediates” and were in many respects amenable toward the
Orthodox Church “extending economia so as not to cast down but rather win
over the brethren peaceably and gradually, on whose behalf our common
Savior and Master poured out His own blood.
”161
In summarizing the stance of Demetrios Chomatianos of Ochrid, we
could say that he is very reasonable and accommodating toward the Latins,
on the one hand, by reason of his general leniency “in the distribution of
justice, because of his occasional bold interpretations”
,
162 and on the other,
because of the particular period of history in which he lived, during which
there was not a full and complete dogmatic deviation and ecclesiastical
severing of contact between the Latins and the Eastern Orthodox Church.
163
His aim in this critical period was to avoid the deepening of these divisions
and to attract as many as had not yet fallen into total schism from the bosom
of the Catholic Church. This pastoral motivation drove him to extreme and
unfounded theological conceptions, which never received canonical validity
in the Church, neither did they secure even minor application in her life (e.g.
his views regarding Holy Communion,
164 the validity of the ordination of
Orthodox by heretical bishops, regarding common prayer with heretics,
regarding whether the Latins are heretics).
165
John of Kitros
John of Kitros, in response to a question of Constantine Cabasilas,
Archbishop of Dyrrachium, as to whether Orthodox may be buried in Latin
churches and have the funeral service chanted by Orthodox and Latin clergy
together, says,
166 “It is therefore not incompatible nor in any way whatsoever
destructive of piety to bury Latins in Roman temples and for the funeral
[hymns] of Latins and Romans to be chanted by both Roman and Latin
celebrants together,
”167 since,
“neither does the place make the departed
worthy of rejection before God, nor still is the psalmody chanted over the
dead by the Latins of Gentile origin, but comes rather from our own Holy
Scriptures.
”168
The above view of John of Kitros proves especially problematic from a
canonical perspective for several reasons:
First, John of Kitros is dealing mainly with the question of whether the
place of burial has a bearing on a person’s journey after death. He responds
definitively that this is totally irrelevant, since the executioners cast many
martyrs’ holy relics “away into places full of mud and filth, but the Grace
bestowed upon the saints remained unharmed in them” while, in contrast, the
burial of many impious men in temples does not spare them from the eternal
fire.
Second, as for the matter of Latins performing a funeral service over the
Orthodox reposed, he answers very erroneously that this is totally without
issue, since “the psalmody chanted over the dead by the Latins [is not] of
Gentile origin, but comes rather from our own Holy Scriptures”! For a
distinguished interpreter of the canonical directives, and for ecclesiastical
order as well, is this presupposition sufficient? Which heretic uses “Gentile”
prayers in his worship? All the prayers of the heretics are “from our own
divine Scriptures,
” are they not?
Third, we must note that, while John of Kitros is an interpreter of the
canons, he ignores them completely; the fact that the canons of the Church
explicitly forbid common prayer with heretics or schismatics does not
concern him at all, not even in the form of a simple reflection, nor does he
even mention it! He refers to common services between “Romans and Latins”
as though this were something obvious and unobjectionable!
Fourth, in the beginning of his response he asserts that differences
between us and the Latins only manifest at two points: mainly the Filioque,
and to a lesser extent the unleavened bread. All the rest “are common
between them and us” (“the readings from Scripture,…and the prayers and
melodies, and the holy temples, and the veneration of both the holy Cross and
the holy icons”). He obviously considers the Latins to be neither heretics nor
schismatics! For this reason, the canonical prohibition “that one must not join
in prayer with heretics or schismatics” does not concern him nor does he
mention it in his argumentation!
Fifth, we especially draw attention to the fact that John of Kitros does not
appeal to economia to support his response, as Demetrios of Ochrid does,
since he does not feel that there exists a prohibition against prayer with the
Latins!
It goes without saying that the above opinions of John of Kitros do not
draw upon the tradition of our Church and are deprived of any sort of
canonical documentation. For this reason,
“it does not appear that this
practice caught on in general, nor is there any additional information about
this anywhere else which would confirm the above, except for the
information offered by the author himself, according to which Orthodox
Romans were being buried in Latin churches, with chanting by both Romans
and Latins together.
”169
Under the Turkish and Latin Yoke
Unfortunately, later, during the period of Ottoman and Latin rule, significant
departures on the part of Orthodox shepherds were observed. Among other
things, it is attested that there took place the commemoration and recognition
of Latin bishops, recognition of papal supremacy, isolated concelebrations,
funerals of heretics, studies in and establishment of schools of heretics, the
granting of permission for confession and teaching to the Papist capuchins
and Protestants. Even metropolitans and monastics confessed to Latins!
During the middle of the 17th century,
“the monasteries of Athos repeatedly
invited the Jesuits to found a school on the Holy Mountain for the spiritual
upbuilding of the monks”!170 As mentioned by Fr. Vasileios Gregoriates,
“the difficult conditions of that time in combination with heavy Western
propaganda significantly weakened the resistance of the enslaved Orthodox
clergy and laity, who had arrived at extreme ignorance and darkness. The
events of that time demonstrate the ignorance and confusion of certain
Orthodox in relation to the heterodox, the corruption of their ecclesiastical
mindset, and the loss of their Orthodox sensitivity.
”171
Surely it is inconceivable for one to contend that the above departures in
times of crisis and decline are worthy of imitation or should serve as an
example for us today! Elsewhere, as Fr. Vasileios Gregoriates relates, the
great Fathers of those eras (Pachomios Rousanos, Dositheos of Jerusalem,
Eugenios, Chrysanthos and Cosmas the Aetolians, Macarius of Patmos,
Athanasius of Paros, Nikodemos the Hagiorite, Maximus the Greek) engaged
in an exemplary struggle to pass on some spiritual light to the Orthodox
people and to protect it from papal propaganda, which raged with the aim of
“deceiving the simplest.
” St. Nikodemos indeed condemned the “Latin-
minded” of his era, the “unmercenary defenders of Latin pseudo-baptism”172
as he called them, and lamented the thitherto great bastardization, corruption,
and misinterpretation of the holy canons and the “deadly and soul-destroying
fruit” that they were producing. In addition, we should not forget that the
isolated opinions and actions of certain Orthodox (even clergy) do not
constitute a measure of the Truth of the Church, but rather as Fr. George
Metallinos characteristically emphasizes,
“Only the actions of the
authentically Orthodox, in other words, of the god-seer saints, constitute an
expression of the Orthodox consciousness.
”173 St. Theodore the Studite
continues further saying that “Hierarchs are in no wise granted authority over
every transgression of the canons, except only to keep in line with what has
been decreed and to follow those that came before,
”174 coming to conclude
that even decisions of councils may not be expressing the Truth of the
Church, since “Councils are not the simple gathering of hierarchs and priests,
even if they be many…but [they are gatherings] in the name of the Lord, in
the peace and preservation of the canons,
”175 since “He who thinks he has the
right faith but is not guided by the divine canons is not perfectly Orthodox
but only halfway so.
”176
In conclusion, we can say that “not only concelebration and co-
officiation, but even the very entry into heterodox temples for the sake of
prayer is forbidden by exactitude. By economia, however, in accordance with
the aforementioned canonical imperatives, it is permitted to enter into
heterodox sanctuaries ‘for the purpose of veneration (of holy relics),
’ but it is
not also permitted to pray in common, and much more so not to co-officiate
or concelebrate with heterodox clergy.
”177 Conversely, whereas regarding the
participation of Orthodox in the worship of heretics the canonical tradition of
our Church is categorically opposed, nonetheless it is more accommodating
toward the mere presence by economia of heretics in Orthodox worship but
without active participation, because deep down it is the same pastoral
condescension operating toward heretics which the Fathers of the Church
always followed: “the Spirit of God suggesting and admonishing us, we
determined to act leniently and pacifically with the before-mentioned men
[the Donatists]…so that… perchance…when we have corrected them with
gentleness, God should grant them repentance for the acknowledging of the
truth, and that they might be snatched out of the snares of the devil, who are
led captive of him at his will.
”178
Ecclesiastical Economia or “Wiliness and Foul Economia”?179
Unfortunately, however, in recent decades cases of common prayer with
heretics have greatly increased and are moving toward becoming the norm
and a given. Certainly, when the holy canons and ecclesiastical tradition are
systematically ignored it is clear that we are moving to dangerous and
unacceptable trails. According to Professor P. Bouteneff of Saint Vladimir’s
Seminary,
“ecclesiological issues are exacerbated where there is a lack of
sacramental clarity.
”180 He goes on to call to mind the “liturgies of Lima,
”181
whereas no one can exclude the possibility of us as Orthodox receiving an
invitation to participate in “various feminist or gay worship services which
have been created.
”182
In the face of this degeneration of the meaning of worship and of the
obvious reactions, rather than seek a solution among the riches of the Patristic
Tradition, the Executive Council of the World Council of Churches deemed it
necessary to publish “A framework for common prayer at WCC
Gatherings”183 as ‘Appendix A’ to the “final draft document of the Special
Commission for Orthodox Participation in the WCC” (Geneva 8.26-
9.3.2002).
184 In other words, the WCC issued canons governing the violation
of the holy canons! In these documents, among other things, a distinction is
made between “confessional” and “interconfessional” common prayer.
During confessional common prayer, each confession performs a service
according to its own rubrics and invites the others to enter into the spirit of its
prayer, whereas in interconfessional common prayer there is no service
performed according to the rubrics of one confession, but an interweaving of
elements of different liturgical traditions in which all participate, regardless
of confessional identity.
We must say that on the part of the Protestant members of the Special
Commission there has been a concerted effort (on the grounds, certainly, of
their own ecclesiology) for some sort of arrangement regarding the problem
of common prayers at the WCC. The issue, however, for the Orthodox
members185 of the Special Commission is crucial: is it permissible to propose
arrangements regarding the problem of common prayer while Orthodox
ecclesiology does not provide for the possibility of common prayer, but
rather provides only canons which forbid common prayers? Is it possible for
Orthodox theologians to contribute to the drafting of rules and canons for the
violation of the holy canons of their Church?
It is totally clear that the differentiation between confessional and
interconfessional common prayer is unprecedented and totally foreign to our
ecclesiastical tradition, and the whole spirit of the previously cited writings is
in no way reminiscent of Orthodox theology and liturgical practice.
186
The above mentioned policy is not only followed in the context of the
WCC. More generally,
“a curious ignoring of Theology (and especially
Ecclesiology)”187 and the development of an ecumenistic “ecclesiology”
188
,
through which an attempt is being made at “theologically” justifying this
uncanonical behavior, in combination with the priority given in the life of the
Church to methods and practices hailing from the realm of public relations,
have led to practices which deeply embitter the People of God. All the things
that took place during the Pope’s previous visit to Constantinople, during the
Thronal Feast of the Ecumenical Patriarchate on the 30th of November 2006
are characteristic of this. I am not referring here to the meetings and events
(conversations, common pronouncements, greetings from the balcony, etc.)
which took place outside the Patriarchal Church of St. George, but to as many
as took place inside the church which surpass the limits of mere common
prayer with one heterodox.
The reception of the pontiff with the
phrase “Blessed is he that cometh in
the name of the Lord.
”
Truly, can a heretical leader be addressed with a salutation that has been
connected exclusively with the person of the Lord?
The salutation of the pontiff as of
canonical Pope and Bishop of Rome
and the petition on his behalf189
Certainly, at such a gathering the leader of the Roman Catholic Church will
be addressed as “Pope and Bishop of Rome,
” titles which (according to
theological exactitude) he cannot have, since he is a heretic.
190 Thus, the two
titles “Pope of Rome” and “Bishop of Rome” are used as termini technici
[technical terms] or at least as a friendly address toward the guest and a
common means of expression, without theological and ecclesiological
significance. It is by the same reasoning that heterodox communities are
reckoned “churches”
, not according to ecclesiological exactitude, since the
Catholic Church was, is, and will be One.
191
In the tradition of our Church alongside exactitude there is also civility
and economia: thus St. Cyril, although condemning Nestorius with severe
expressions for his errors, calls him “honorable,
”192 “most-honorable,
”193
“most-venerable bishop,
”194 and he addresses him with the phrase “your
piety.
”195 But to chant hymns and commemorate a heretic as canonical Pope
and Bishop of Rome alongside the Patriarch of Constantinople during a
service in the Patriarchal Church is a totally different thing!
Can the above be considered merely an amicable gesture or does it
constitute a de facto acceptance of a heresy as part of the Church of Christ
and of its leader a canonical hierarch? Is not such an idea foreign to the
Tradition of the Fathers and does it not run totally counter to Orthodox
ecclesiology?
From Mere Common Prayer to Concelebration
Unfortunately, though, the common prayer in Constantinople was not limited
to a simple petition but it extended to include a partial concelebration. During
the official Patriarchal and Synodal Divine Liturgy of the Thronal Feast of
the Ecumenical Patriarchate,
196 the Pope was permitted to recite the Lord’s
Prayer,
197 they censed him as though he were a canonical Bishop,
198 and
most notably he received from the Patriarch and then reciprocated the
liturgical kiss,
199 during the Holy Anaphora—actions which are only
permissible for concelebrating priests and hierarchs! He was also offered the
lectern and took advantage of the opportunity to preach papal primacy within
the Patriarchal Church! Only in the holy altar he did not enter—yet!
Nevertheless, let us be allowed to ask a few questions:
• When a clergyman (whether he be a priest, a bishop or even the
primate of an autocephalous church) attending a liturgy in the
presence of the Ecumenical Patriarch does not liturgize but prays
together in the holy altar, will the officiating Ecumenical Patriarch
exchange the kiss of peace with him? Certainly not, in accordance
with the liturgical proscriptions, since the kiss of peace pertains only
to the serving clergy. How, then, is a kiss given to the Pope? Is the
Pope a concelebrant of the Patriarch?
• Is it permissible for us to use the kiss of peace—the ultimate moment
of manifesting unity in truth and love—differently than what has been
proscribed by our liturgical tradition?200 That is, by downgrading it to
a gesture of social politeness and socialization, on the level of emotion
or of ecclesiastical politics?
• Is the liturgical kiss an independent act, or is it the prerequisite so that
“with one mind we may confess” the Trinitarian Dogma, Theology, as
this was set out in the Creed? When there is no common confession of
faith (since there is not common theology) what purpose does a kiss of
peace between an Orthodox hierarch and a heretical leader serve?
• Since when is a heretic able to pray during worship as a canonical
Orthodox Christian?
• Is it possible for a heretic, and indeed a leader of a heresy, to represent
the Orthodox people in the sacred worship by reciting the Lord’s
Prayer as a Primate in the name of the fullness [plēroma] of our
Church?
• For us to recite the Lord’s Prayer, must there not be “unity of faith”?
Is there such unity with the Pope?
• The “Our Father” is the main prayer of preparation of the people for
“the supersubstantial [daily] bread” of Holy Communion.
201 Can a
man expressly prohibited from receiving Holy Communion (the Pope)
pray within the Divine Liturgy which the Orthodox are performing,
saying,
“give us this day” this Bread? What meaning does such a
prayer have?
• Since the Pope was not merely following along but actively
participated in the Divine Liturgy, why did he not then commune?
Perhaps someone would respond that it is not permitted by the order
of our Church, since he is heterodox! Why, were the other things he
did permissible? What canonical order, what Saint of our Church
allows for a heretic to say the Lord’s Prayer during the Divine
Liturgy, to be censed as a celebrant, to exchange a liturgical kiss, etc.
and then forbids him to commune?
• How can the aforementioned be compatible with the clear stance of
our Ecumenical Patriarch that “communion in the Mysteries is not
permissible before total unity in faith is achieved…To step toward
union through sacramental communion would be to take a step
backward…Sacramental communion without the unity of the faith is
like a bank note not backed by gold”?202 Or does the phrase
“communion in the sacraments” perhaps imply only the moment of
reception of Holy Communion and not the whole Divine Liturgy of
the faithful?203 Is such blatant disrespect for the Divine Liturgy
theologically permissible?
• What can be said about the granting of the lectern to the leader of a
heresy to preach to the faithful? Can we as Orthodox remain
indifferent and not be made uneasy, and not be enraged, when within
the All-Venerable Patriarchal Church the Pope openly preaches papal
supremacy? From the podium of Saints Alexander, Gregory,
Chrysostom, Photios, Philotheus,
204 to have error preached! Does this
not equate to betrayal?
• Finally, must not the presiding celebrant of that Divine Liturgy be
asked, with all our respect, upon what ecclesiastical ordinance is the
practice founded of ceding to a heretic—according to the unanimous
opinion of the Saints and Councils—the right of active participation in
the Orthodox Divine Liturgy, when the whole tradition of our Church,
all the Fathers, all the local and ecumenical councils—without
exception—are entirely categorical and expressly forbid it, affording
severe canonical penalties to those who oppose them?
Perhaps the above can be accommodated and justified as “behavior
exemplary of politeness or certain formal demonstrations during worship”?
205
Perhaps, however, they can be justified as happening by economia?
Perhaps by economia the incomplete concelebration of Pope and Patriarch is
permissible? The answer is categorically “no!” Never did any saint anywhere
permit for a recognized heretic, and indeed the leader of a heresy206
—
remaining in heresy—to participate actively in the Divine Liturgy!
Furthermore, what pressing need necessitated the “concelebration” with
the Pontiff? On behalf of which “greater aim,
”207 which could not have been
achieved in some other way, was the order of the Church ignored? What
benefit, at any rate, could emerge for the Church that would justify common
prayer with the Pope? No presupposition for the application of economia
exists which could justify the active participation of the Pontiff in Orthodox
worship.
Besides, Patriarch Bartholomew himself is clear regarding “eucharistic
communion” with heterodox: “The whole issue is in essence ecclesiological;
it would be advisable and advantageous for ecumenical dialogue that it be
stated unequivocally…that what is being advocated by some, [namely]
eucharistic communion between Orthodox and non-Orthodox, while the
schism is still in effect, cannot be accepted by the Orthodox Church even by
economia.
”208 And assuredly,
“eucharistic communion” does not start at
“With the fear of God, faith and love draw near” and end at “Save, O God
Thy people”
…
Consequently, it is no exaggeration if we were to apply the following
words of Saint Theodore the Studite to the case of common prayer of
Patriarch and Pope: “Do not any longer acknowledge [this as] a mode of
economia but rather as a judgement-debt for lawlessness and for violation of
the divine canons.
”209 Or we could repeat the words of the Athonite monks,
adapting them to the contemporary situation: “Are we to do this as
economia? How can the violation of the sacred be accepted as economia…?
And what could be more harmful that such ‘economia’? This is obvious
communion with them and a denial and subversion of all that is good; for the
one who accepts a heretic inherits his crimes, and the one who communes
with the excommunicated is excommunicated, as one confusing the canon of
the Church.
”210
The above worry is not incited by some “stubborn, false would-be
brothers, constituting groups of fanatical supporters of supposed
‘institutions’
, slaves in many ways of a religious faithlessness, of a neo-
manichaeanistic fundamentalism, of a projected metaphysical guilt, of an
easy work so that they may live like sects, they, the buyers and sellers of
‘pure religion’
.
”211 (How lamentable that such characterizations should be
uttered by an Orthodox hierarch before the Patriarch, the representatives of
the Autocephalous Orthodox Churches, and the heterodox at the Thronal
Feast of the Patriarchate as an indiscriminate affront against all those faithful
that harbour some—lesser or great—reservations with regards to the
dialogues!)
Quite the contrary, it is supporters of the inter-Christian dialogues and of
the Ecumenical Movement that are worrying and denounce these practices as
lacking any theological foundation whatsoever, such that in the end they
undermine the theological dialogue itself. Archbishop Stylianos
(Harkianakis) of Australia, a hierarch of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, for
twenty years a co-president of the Formal Theological Dialogue with the
Roman Catholics, in a speech of his on the 10th of May 1985 refers to “tragic
mistakes” that have been made in this regard: “First and foremost, an
excessive friendliness toward Rome has become prevalent, which was
expressed in irresponsible ways and ones that do not stand up to theological
scrutiny…Many hierarchs unfortunately…hasten to exchange a kiss at the
holiest moment of the Holy Eucharist, when we say ‘let us love one another.
’
This is the moment during which we express the highest and deepest union of
the concelebrants alone. The celebrants do not have the right to exchange the
kiss even with [non-celebrant] hierarchs and other priests that are in the altar,
with whom they share the same faith. And yet there are Orthodox hierarchs—
it is not necessary for me to name names—who, well-intentioned but without
having an awareness of how great a theological responsibility they bear at
that moment, exchange a kiss with heterodox clergy, even though there is no
outcome; it is unrequited, since they will not commune from a common
chalice. Why, then, do they kiss them?… Another mistake no less tragic is
that, in our effort to be welcoming to others, many times Orthodox hierarchs
unfortunately call the Pope ‘first bishop of Christendom.
’” This is another
theological falsehood. …In a divided Christendom, the Pope is not first
among equals, nor even equal among equals! The present Pope should be
reckoned after the last Orthodox Bishop, since he is in schism and heresy.
These things are so self-evident, that it feels excessive to even say them…
‘Presiding in love,
’ according to Orthodox theology, is not something that
can be attributed to the Roman See as it currently stands. Such words, when
they are said, are irresponsible. And unfortunately they create much noise,
much damage, without profiting anything. Thus do we give the impression
that we are hastening toward Intercommunio, a sacramental communion with
the heterodox… By addressing the Pope or Rome, as I have said, with
paternal titles full of familiar content we only do harm and conversely we do
not benefit the dialogue at all. Very simply, it is a falsehood for us to issue
such addresses, a theological falsehood.
”212
We also do well to recall here the especially important address of
Archimandrite Joseph, Abbot of the Holy Monastery of Xeropotamou, during
the visit of Patriarch Bartholomew to that holy monastery, on the 21st of
August 2008. With the requisite reverence but also with utmost clarity the
abbot said among other things,
“Now, Your All-Holiness, allow us your
children, as having filial boldness toward You, to refer to two matters that
afflict our hearts and scandalize our monastic consciences but also the
consciences of very many pious Orthodox Christians who come to us. The
first are the continuous formal declarations and common prayers on the part
of Your All-Holiness—in churches and televised—of recognition of
representatives of the already totally secularised and incorrigible modern-day
Papism…Your All-Holiness, together with holy Chrysostom we the humble
and unworthy ones beseech Thee: “Do not accept any distorted dogma under
the pretense of love.
”213 As the Holy Mountain has confessed and assured
you recently but also earlier, we the lowly monks of Xeropotamou along with
the pious faithful that share in our concern ‘remain faithful to the Faith of the
Holy Apostles and the Holy Fathers, out of love also toward the heterodox,
who are helped when, by keeping a consistent Orthodox stance, the Orthodox
show them the depth of their spiritual illness and the means of its healing.
’214
We painfully and reverently beseech that the “theological dialogue be never
accompanied by common prayers, participation in liturgical acts and
gatherings of worship, or other acts of any kind, which may give the
impression that our Orthodox Church accepts the Roman Catholics as a full
Church and the Pope as canonical Bishop of Rome. Such acts delude the
Orthodox plēroma and the Roman Catholics, giving them a false impression
of how Orthodoxy views them…
”215 Since we are unable to do otherwise but
to believe that we share “the same spirit of faith” with Your All-Holiness, as
it is written,
“I believed, wherefore I spake,
” so “we too believe, and so we
speak”
…In Your paternal love forgive us this confessional digression and
look into the countenances of our humble brotherhood, which regard Thee
with great reverence.
”216
In his response, not only did the Ecumenical Patriarch not reckon the
concerns to be exaggerated or coming from ill-intent, but he commended the
Abbot for his words and concern and thus “reassured” him: “We commend
your sensitivity, we paternally commend your love of truth and your honesty
also and we reassure you by repeating epigrammatically that ‘the guards have
knowledge of this.
’”217,218 Certainly it would have been preferable if there
had been no need for such “patriarchal” assertions aiming to “reassure” us.
Who is responsible for the fact that a portion of the Orthodox faithful (clergy
and laity) is concerned about the “guards,
” harbouring serious reservations
regarding certain of their actions? Are the “guards” free of all responsibility
in this situation?
Chapter V
The Holy Canons Still Apply Today
WHEN “THEOLOGICAL” ARGUMENTS PROVE insufficient to justify common
prayers with heretics, then the holy canons themselves, as well the practice of
the Church up to this point, are fully rejected as passé and not applicable
today.
It is unfortunately forgotten that “the canons which regulate the life of the
Church ‘in her earthly aspect’ are inseparable from Christian dogma. They
are not ‘legal constructs’
, as is often said, but applications of the dogma of
the Church, of the revealed tradition in all aspects of practical life of the
Christian Community.
”219 For this reason,
“faithfulness to the Apostolic
Tradition, the confession of faith, life and creation, all these are safeguarded
and directed by the canons…From the moment that dogma loses its meaning
and significance, we arrive at total disdain of the canons. We have suddenly
understood that which the Holy Fathers did not understand: the canons are
nothing more than ‘human contrivances’ and not the practical application of
the dogmas of the Church in life.
‘The councils, the canons, these have all
been annulled.
’ Nowadays every one of us claims for himself the right to the
preamble of the Council,
‘it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us,
”220 as
Leonid Uspensky rightly asks. Perhaps in our days the fears of St. Basil have
materialized: “It troubles me greatly that the canons of the Fathers and all
exactitude of the Churches has been expelled, and I fear that little by little
this indifference will take us down a road to total confusion in matters of the
Church.
”221
Let’s examine some telling cases:
Who Is It That Denies the Validity of the Holy Canons? A
Refutation of Their Arguments.
Metropolitan Methodios of Pisidia (Fouyas, formerly Archbishop of
Thyateira) states: “Nevertheless, above the canons is the Church which
teaches and gives laws upon the basis of Holy Scriptures.
”222 “The use of
ecclesiastical economia does not depend upon the things decreed but upon the
Church’s privilege of being the pillar and foundation of truth…by the
authority of the Holy Spirit the Church, proceeding to the realization of her
mission toward those within and those without, has the freedom to transgress
even the very dogmatic teaching itself, independently of temporal events,
depending only upon the Holy Spirit and not upon history. This [dogmatic]
teaching does not shape the consciousness of the Church, but is itself this
same conscience.
”223 “The Church is a tree which continues to develop, and
which does not at all cease its development. For this reason I believe that it is
not right to ask ‘What do the Fathers say?’ regarding every issue and for us to
do the same as well.
”224 “The Church is not limited to what we are taught by
the past; we should not submit to it in a slavish way. The Consensus Patrum
does not mean that we must always repeat whatever they said and did, since
there are opinions of the Fathers on major theological issues which today
must be altered.
”225 “It is incumbent upon Orthodox theologians to delve
more into the nature of the Church as She is manifest today and not as She
was in the era of St. Cyprian226
…The reflections of the ecclesiastical leaders
of the past, as insightful as they may be, are not to be reckoned higher than
the Holy Scriptures.
”227 “Regarding this, the Russian L. Zander of blessed
memory states the following: ‘We cannot solve the problems of our relations
with the heterodox by basing ourselves on canons that pertain to situations
and heresies which have disappeared from the horizon.
’”228
Despite the fact that the above thoughts are confused, insufficient, vague
enough, and lend themselves to various interpretations, we must ask
ourselves: Is the teaching of the Church not identical to Divine Revelation,
which is singular and is expressed from within Holy Scripture, the Consensus
Patrum, and the terms and canons of the ecumenical councils? Is it
theologically permissible to distinguish between Holy Scripture on the one
hand and the canons and the patristic consciousness on the other, and further
to present the them as being in opposition to each other? Is it conceivable for
the Church to be at variance with her own expression?
Professor Constantine Scouteris, in his memorandum229 to the Special
Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC (Berekfürdő, Hungary,
11.15-20.2001), says among other things: “The Church composed these
canons. Therefore, the canons are not above the Church, but rather the
Church is above the canons… In no case can the canons replace the Church
or subjugate her.
” He continues,
“The canons which prohibit common prayer
with heretics…have their historical context and were issued on account of the
particular conditions of that era. Even though these canons are no longer in
effect, they have not been revoked and could be applied again, if the
combination of circumstances which initially necessitated their issuance re-
emerges, thus re-entering the life of the Church…The canons do not limit the
Church which created them, nor do they bind her within one context from
which She cannot become unbound.
”230 In support of these views he
mentions the application of the holy canons with economia and invokes the
practice of the Church regarding catechumens, who, although not baptised,
are nonetheless allowed to participate in worship.
Observations regarding the above thoughts:
• On what is the assertion that “these canons are no longer in effect”
founded? When did the Church place these canons into disuse?
Certainly never! The same professor immediately confirms the same
when he notes that “ecumenical common prayer has been met with
skepticism by a contingency of Orthodox faithful, and even
Churches.
” That some do not apply the canons does not mean that
they are not in effect for the Church. Going forward, evidence will be
provided which demonstrates that for the conscience of the Church as
it is expressed today through distinguished theologians, bishops
(archbishops and patriarchs), synods of local Orthodox Churches, and
even by an inter-Orthodox Meeting, these holy canons must enjoy
respect and application.
• To justify the practice of common prayers there must be an appeal to
ecclesiastical economia. This is essentially a total affirmation of the
validity of the holy canons today. However, the use of economia, as
has already been emphasized, must occur alongside certain
presuppositions, which are not being met.
• Whereas the pastoral dimension of the holy canons is being
recognized and accepted (“the canons were always the means by
which the Church protects the life of her children,
” relates the
professor), the assertion that today the same dangers do not exist
which once obliged the Church to issue these canons is unjustified.
Perhaps these dangers are even greater for the faithful today.
• What does it mean in practice that the Church is above the holy
canons and is not bound by them? By deciding in ecumenical councils
the Church issued the holy canons so as to delineate the ecclesiastical
ministry of each of her members, among other things. That was in
force then. It remains in force today! Did the Church revoke the holy
canons in an ecumenical council? Definitely not! As a consequence,
the evangelical directives and decisions of the appropriate
ecclesiastical Bodies—and especially the ecumenical councils—bind
us absolutely, delineating the bounds of our actions and activities both
then and now. In other words: Yes! The Church is “above” the
canons. We, however, the members, whether patriarchs or laity, are
“below” the canons and are absolutely bound by them. Only if one
believes that he himself is the Church can he assert that he is not
bound by the holy canons and arbitrarily apply some and abolish
others!
• The stance of the Church toward catechumens cannot be used to
justify the current status quo of common prayers with heretics,
because (i) catechumens “have expressed the desire to become
members of the Church,
” heretics, however have not; (ii) catechumens
come to the holy sanctuary with a spirit of discipleship toward
ecclesiastical tradition, heretics, however, do not; (iii) catechumens
come to the holy sanctuary so that we the faithful can pray for them
“that the Lord would have mercy on them, teach them the word of
truth, reveal to them the gospel of righteousness…Illumine them…
regenerate them, grant unto them the perfection of faith…
”231 Would
the heretics accept such a prayer for themselves?
• And the most important point: catechumens merely follow along, and
do not participate in the officiation of worship, and in fact leave
immediately following the teaching, before the beginning of the
Liturgy of the Faithful. In the final analysis, when the Church cannot
accept even the catechumens in the Divine Liturgy, how can we today
try to justify the active participation of heretics in our worship or the
cooperation of Orthodox in the “interconfessional common prayer” of
the WCC? Rightly does the Patriarch of Antioch and “most-renowned
exegete of the holy canons” Theodore Balsamon wonder: “If the
catechumens are not permitted to remain for the offering of the divine
sacrifice, how can heretics, unless they first profess to repent and
abandon heresy? And even then, I believe, they are not to be permitted
inside the temple, but outside together with the catechumens. But if
they will not profess to abandon their heresy, let them not even stand
with the catechumens, but let them be chased out.
”232
Archimandrite Barthomew Archontonis (current Ecumenical
Patriarch), referring to the canons which forbid common prayer with
heretics, notes the following summarily in his doctoral dissertation “On the
Codification of the Holy Canons and of the Canonical Provisions in the
Orthodox Church”: “The canons which govern the relations of Orthodox
Christians with the heterodox and those of other religions are unenforceable
and must be changed. It is not possible for the Church to have ordinances
prohibiting the entry of the heterodox into the temples and common prayer
with them while at the same time through her representatives She prays in
common with them for the final unity in faith, love, and hope. More love
must ‘water’ many canonical ordinances ‘for the begetting of life’
. There
exists the imperative need for the modification of certain ordinances unto a
form more philanthropic and realistic. The Church can not and must not live
outside of space and time.
”233
Furthermore, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in an article entitled
“The problem of Oikonomia today” in the journal Kanon 6 (1983) of the
Society for the Law of the Eastern Churches (Vienna, Austria) among other
things states the following: “(i) As regards the first position, its supporters
give a literal interpretation to certain holy canons which refer to conditions
and heresies that have disappeared for some time now. Today an ecclesial
reality surrounds us which cannot be ignored. The Holy Spirit, which
“bloweth where it listeth” (Jn 3:8) and which is not limited only to the history
of the past, is by all means present amidst the heterodox as well.
”234
Let us be allowed to make some observations:235
• It is clear that the dissertation of the Ecumenical Patriarch is not a call
to violate and ignore the canons which prohibit common prayer with
heretics. All that is recommended is that they be abolished in a future
codification of the Canon Law of our Church. Indeed, the Patriarch
cites the second canon of the Council in Trullo, which expressly
declares,
“no one shall be permitted to countermand or set aside the
canons previously laid down, or to recognize and accept any canons,
other than the ones herein specified… If, nevertheless, anyone be
caught innovating with regard to any of the said canons, or attempting
to subvert it, he shall be responsible in respect of that canon and shall
receive the penance which it prescribes and be chastised by that canon
which he has offended.
” Regarding this the Ecumenical Patriarch
expressly clarifies: “obviously these prohibitions refer to several
members of the Church”236
—regardless of whether they are laity or
clergy.
• According to the above paper, no one—not even the local council of
an autocephalous church—can modify or abolish the holy canons,
since “only the Church in an ecumenical council is able to modify or
abolish ancient canons.
”237 Thus, he repeats,
“we emphasize once
more that the holy canons of the ecumenical councils, as well as those
canons of local councils and of Fathers that have been validated by the
former, are not immutable but irrevocable—at least de jure—pending
the modification or abolition thereof by a later ecumenical
council,
”238 since it is “an axiom of Ecclesiastical Law in particular
but also Law in general that an ordinance can be modified or revoked
only by a power equal or greater to that by which it was issued”239
and the holy canons in question have been validated by ecumenical
councils. As a consequence, following ecclesiastical tradition,
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew concludes in his paper that the
canons that forbid common prayer with heretics, since they have not
been abolished by an ecumenical council (nor by the local synod of
any autocephalous Church), remain in effect and we all owe the
utmost respect to their application.
• Besides this, however, the modification called for by the
aforementioned dissertation (which is essentially an abolition, since it
notes that “it is not possible for the Church to have ordinances”) is
insufficiently justified, since it is not founded upon any ecclesiastical
or canonical reasons or arguments. The only reason is that “it is not
possible for them to be applied today!”
Nevertheless, if the above logic were to prevail more broadly in the life of
the Church, we would be led to an abolition of Christian ethics or even the
self-abolition of the Church itself, since the Church would be thus
transformed into saltless salt.
240
According to the teaching of the canons even those things performed by
economia cannot become canons in the Church: “What was introduced by
economia for some useful end must not be turned into an example and be
henceforth held as a canon.
”241 Furthermore, the violation of ecclesiastical
order cannot be tolerated and even produce a legal practice.
242 Indeed,
according to the 7th canon of the First-Second Council,
“nothing that has
been unlawfully and irregularly in vogue can be taken as the prejudice of
what is canonically consistent,
”243 and according to Balsamon,
“that which is
contrary to the canons cannot be turned into an exemplar,
”244 whereas
according to Zonaras,
“those things occurring unlawfully may not do so to
the detriment and undoing of canonical practice.
”245 Besides, Patriarch
Bartholomew himself in a letter to Patriarch Alexei of Moscow of blessed
memory highlights the most serious danger of “those insistently setting
aside” the holy canons: “In canonical order ‘a negative precedent may not be
turned into an exemplar’ in support of later actions, since the holy canons
‘take their revenge,
’ sooner or later, on them that insistently set them
aside.
”246
The above paper emphasizes that the Church in our day,
“through her
representatives, prays in common with [the heterodox] for the final unity in
faith, in love, in hope,
” and for this reason “it is not possible for [the relevant
canons] to be applied in our day.
” Yet not only “in our day” but always the
Church has prayed and does pray “for the unity of all” and She has always in
her history247 dialogued with schismatics and heretics, and even with some of
other religions, and in many cases her prayer “for the final unity in faith, in
love, in hope” was fulfilled. And yet, at all times common prayer was
forbidden and at all times the prohibition against it was observed with
respect. Why is it “in our day” “not possible for [the canons of our Church] to
be applied”?
As for it being not only possible but also needful to combine inter-
Christian relations with respect to the Church’s tradition, let us give ear to
one experienced in the theological dialogues, Protopresbyter of the
Ecumenical Throne Fr. Theodore Zisis, who proposes the only type of
conduct canonically acceptable: “There is another means of dialogue and
approach to the heterodox, without intermingling, common prayers, and
concelebrations: the mere bodily presence, by economia, without any
prayerful or liturgical participation… Even during the opening of the
theological discussions during the meeting (at Ferrara), the Latins and the
Orthodox prayed separately,
248 a practice which is observed up to our day in
some theological dialogues.
”249
Relevant is also the Announcement of 4.9/22.1980 of the Holy
Extraordinary Double Synaxis of the Holy Community of the Holy Mountain
Athos “Regarding the Dialogue between Orthodox and Roman Catholics”
,
wherein, among other things, the Holy Mountain was requesting that
henceforth “theological dialogue be never accompanied by common prayers,
participation in liturgical acts and gatherings of worship, or other acts of any
kind, which may give the impression that our Orthodox Church accepts the
Roman Catholics as a full Church and the Pope as canonical Bishop of Rome.
Such acts delude the Orthodox plēroma and the Roman Catholics, giving
them a false impression of how Orthodoxy views them…
”250
Let us also not forget that up until very recently theological dialogues
were being carried out with the pre-Chalcedonian Churches. And yet, the
issue of common prayer with them never arose, because these churches
respect ecclesiastical order regarding this point! This compliance of the
participants of this theological dialogue with canonical tradition did nothing
to impede the dialogue from going forward. For what reason, then, should
this practice not also be applied in our contacts with the Roman Catholics or
the Protestants?
In the same spirit of Fr. Theodore Zisis’s proposal is the aforementioned
Encyclical of January 31, 1952 of the Patriarchal Synod under Patriarch
Athenagoras to the Primates of the Orthodox Churches, which encourages
representatives of Autocephalous Churches that participate in theological
dialogues,
“in the liturgical gatherings with the heterodox as being
antithetical to the holy canons and dulling the confessional sensitivity of the
Orthodox, [to] strive to perform, if possible, purely Orthodox services and
ceremonies, that the splendour and majesty of Orthodox worship may thus be
presented before the eyes of the heterodox.
”251
Consequently, as always, so also “in our day,
” it is totally possible and
the duty of all of us to conform, in our conduct and in our ecclesiastical
ministry, to the canons of the Church. The alternative will be catastrophic for
us and for our mission.
In the above doctoral dissertation of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew
it is mentioned without clarification that the canons which forbid common
prayer with heretics must be repealed since “More love must ‘water’ many
canonical ordinances ‘for the begetting of life.
’ There exists the imperative
need for the modification of certain ordinances unto a form more
philanthropic.
” Cοuld this be implying that we today can be shown forth as
more compassionate and as men of greater love than the saints who issued,
validated, and applied the canons of our Church throughout the ages? Or
were perhaps the saints motivated by an unloving spirit or even hatred when
writing and applying the holy canons? This is not clarified!
In addition, it is suggested that there be a modification of the canons
regulating relations with those of other religions! Could this be implying that
perhaps there must be a retraction also of the prohibitions on common prayer
with those of other religions? Yet is it possible for there to be common prayer
or participation of Orthodox clergy in a liturgical gathering of shamans,
animists, Hindus or any other religion? This is not clarified!
In the article in the journal “Kanon,
” the Ecumenical Patriarch says that
the holy canons which prohibit common prayer with heretics “refer to
conditions and heresies that have disappeared for some time now. Today an
ecclesial reality surrounds us which cannot be ignored,
” clearly implying that
today the holy canons cannot be applied.
Question: Certainly today’s historical conditions are not the same as those
that existed when the relevant canons which forbid common prayer with
heretics were composed. Is this, however, a sufficient reason for us not to
apply these particular holy canons? If we consistently apply this logic, are we
not brought to an ecclesiological impasse? What is to become of the other
holy canons from the same period dealing with the institution of the
Pentarchy of Patriarchates, for example, or with the jurisdiction of the
Autocephalous Churches, etc.? Should these perhaps not be applied either,
since today the same conditions do not exist? Woe to us then!252
Additionally, how can it be justified for the decisions of a local council
(e.g. the Conciliar Tomos of 1850 “Regarding the Declaration of the
Autocephaly of the Church of Greece” and the Patriarchal and Conciliar Act
of 1928 “regarding the administration of the Holy Metropolises of the New
Lands”)253 to be characterized as “most holy and most honorable charters”254
entertaining no talk of their modification and for the violators thereof to incur
the most serious penalties, while the sixteen holy canons of the Fourth, Sixth,
and Seventh Ecumenical Councils, and of the Local Councils of Laodicea
and Antioch, of Saint Timothy (validated by ecumenical councils) are
violated and ignored, and their abolition is requested without any theological
argument? Does perhaps the Patriarchal and Conciliar Act of 1928 have
greater validity than the canons of three ecumenical councils?
The Metropolitan of Tallinn and all Estonia Stephanos, referring to the
canonical position of the Ecumenical Throne within the Orthodox Church,
notes regarding the holy canons: “The holy canons… are precisely here not to
be modified according to the demands of the times and the imperatives of the
moment, but to reflect the unbroken continuation of the perennial
ecclesiastical tradition.
”255
Moreover, even if the present-day “ecclesial reality [that] surrounds us” is
different—besides, every age is different—despite this, during the era of the
ecumenical councils had not comparable cases of heresies and schisms
emerged? Was there not then also on the part of the Church a desire for
reconciliation and unity with heretics? Did not the Church then also want the
fulfillment of the prayer of the Lord,
“that they might all be one”? Yet this
did not hinder the Fathers from prohibiting common prayer with heretics and
schismatics!
Finally, the above article in the journal “Kanon” referring to the lack of
application of the holy canons notes that,
“The Holy Spirit, which “bloweth
where it listeth” (Jn 3:8) and which is not limited only to the history of the
past, is by all means present amidst the heterodox as well.
”
Question: Was it not always the case that “the Holy Spirit…bloweth
where it listeth”? Did not the Fathers of the ecumenical councils know this,
they who issued and enforced the commandment “that one must not join in
prayer with heretics or schismatics”? And even if we suppose that the unclear
assertion that the Holy Spirit “is present also amidst the heterodox” of today
is unchallenged theologically,
256 why was it not also present in the same way
among the heterodox of yesterday? And since it was “present” among the
heterodox, heretics, and schismatics of old, why do the ecumenical councils
forbid common prayer with them? And if the Councils rightly forbade
common prayer with heterodox who “have” the Holy Spirit, can we today act
contrary to the canons of the ecumenical councils?
Who Does Accept the Validity of the Holy Canons?
From the above it is clear that the notion that the canons which forbid
common prayer are not in effect for the Church today is completely mistaken.
We have already made reference to the opinions of distinguished theologians
and clergy who respect the canonical tradition of our Church. Let us also add
other remarks from contemporary representatives of the Orthodox Church:
“They ask us”
, reads the official gazette of the Church of Greece, the
magazine “Ecclesia”
,
“if concelebrations and common prayers of the
heterodox with our own, as happens often in America, are permissible
canonically. We answer dutifully, that this is both uncustomary and
anticanonical, but also that it will wield destructive influence.
”257
Professor Panagiotis Trembelas notes the following regarding the
opinions of a hierarch that used the canonical tradition arbitrarily: “Why has
he forgotten…the holy canons, the 32nd of Antioch, the 46th of the Holy
Apostles, the 33rd of Laodicea, etc. which expressly forbid sacramental
communion with heretics under penalty of excommunication and deposition?
Or do the holy canons only apply when they serve certain interests and
pursuits of ours? My father, do not forget that, while these canons are easily
violated, a moment comes when they will be cruelly avenged.
”258
In a memorandum of his to the Special Committee on Orthodox
Participation in the WCC, which convened in Berekfürdő, Hungary (11.15-
20.2001), Professor Constantine Scouteris realized that “ecumenical
common prayer has been met with skepticism by a certain contingency of
Orthodox faithful and even Churches.
”259
During the seventh general assembly of the WCC in Canberra in 1991
and during the meeting of the Central Committee in Geneva in 1992 “the
Orthodox participants strongly objected to the idea of sacramental
intercommunion with the heterodox”
260
.
The Special Commission on Orthodox Participation in the WCC and
subsequently the Central Committee of the WCC in August 2002
acknowledge that “for certain Churches prayer with other Christians outside
their tradition is not only problematic but considered even impossible” and
“Orthodox Christians must take into consideration the holy canons which
could be interpreted as forbidding such prayer.
”261 It is especially important
that even the Protestants of the Central Committee of the WCC sympathize,
understand, and respect the canonical tradition of the Orthodox Church,
which we Orthodox oftentimes scorn, indirectly or directly.
Metropolitan Nikodemos of Patras of blessed memory mentions that
“questions of inter-ecclesial contact within the liturgical practice and
sacramental life of the Church are questions of dogmatic and canonical,
inviolable principles, not questions of strategy, expediency, or other similar
aims,
” and he characterizes such cases of inter-ecclesial contact as “untimely
liturgical collaborations, which many of our own consider suspicious, not
without reason, as purposely ignoring the required precondition of dogmatic
unity, to the effect of the creation of misleading impressions of unity and the
portrayal of the Western Church as being highly in line with our own.
”262
Saint Paisios the Athonite is described in his biography as having “great
Orthodox sensitivity, and for this reason did not accept common prayers and
communion with non-Orthodox persons. He emphasized,
‘For us to pray in
common with someone, we must agree in faith.
’ He would sever his ties or
avoid seeing clergy that participated in common prayers with heterodox.
”263
Archbishop Chrysostomos II of Athens of blessed memory does not
accept common liturgical prayer with Roman Catholics, which he
characterizes as “communion with heretics in the West”
264
.
Archbishop Ieronymos of Athens of blessed memory comes to the
following conclusion in his relevant paper: “Not only concelebration and
common officiation but even the very entry into heterodox churches for the
purpose of prayer is forbidden by exactitude. By economia, however…entry
into heterodox churches is permissible ‘for the purpose of the veneration (of
holy Relics)’
, but not so common prayer, and even more so not co-officiation
and concelebration with heterodox clergy.
”265
Archbishop Seraphim of Athens of blessed memory not only rejected
common prayers with the Roman Catholics, but also wondered if the papists
are even a church.
Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens of blessed memory, responding to
a letter of the Holy Community of Mt. Athos about his visit to the Vatican
relates: “Following in the footsteps of the holy and Godbearing Fathers, and
also in agreement with the holy canons… neither had we common prayer of
course, nor did we anything else contrary to the canonical order of our
Orthodox Church.
”266
The Committee of the Holy Community of Mt. Athos on Dogmatic
Issues in its memorandum regarding the participation of the Orthodox Church
in the World Council of Churches (Mt. Athos, February 2007) emphasizes,
“The pastoral dimension of the holy canons renders meaningful the use
thereof as much in the era during which they were written as today.
”267
Although Saint Justin Popovich accepted dialogue with the Roman
Catholics under certain conditions, in his advisory report to the Holy Synod
of the Patriarchate of Serbia he notes,
“The relevant canons of the Holy
Apostles and the Holy Fathers apply not only to the ancient era, but they
continue to be absolutely in effect today, among all of us contemporary
Orthodox Christians. They also apply undoubtedly to our position toward the
Roman Catholics and Protestants.
”268
The Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Serbia approved Saint Justin’s
advisory report and did not permit clergy to participate in “common prayer
and ecumenical services” which the Roman Catholic Church organized in
Yugoslavia. The Roman Catholic Archbishops of Croatia and Slovenia had
extended the invitation during the duration of the “Week of Prayer for
Christian Unity.
”269
The Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church in America,
270 in one of its
encyclical letters regarding the unity of Christians and Ecumenism, wishing
to “restate the position which has always been that of the Orthodox Church, a
position which unfortunately even some of our Orthodox brethren have
ignored or forgotten,
” declares: “Dearly beloved brothers and sisters, it is our
duty as bishops of the Church and guardians of the apostolic faith to confess
that the Orthodox Church is the one Church of Christ…The fundamental self-
understanding of the Orthodox Church…has always served as the basis for
Orthodox participation in the ecumenical movement.
” And continuing,
“we
categorically reject the use of eucharistic communion and sacramental
‘intercommunion’ as a means of achieving Christian unity. According to the
Orthodox Faith, the sacraments and the liturgy of the Church, most
specifically the Holy Eucharist, cannot be separated from the very being of
the Church, which they exist to manifest. The sacraments are not devotions or
psychological symbols. They are the manifestations of the essence of the
Church as the Kingdom of God on earth. Outside the unity of faith in the one
Church of Christ, which cannot be divided, there can be no sacramental
communion and no liturgical concelebration.
” Furthermore,
“Formal
liturgical worship which involves the active participation of clergy and laity
of different confessions is contrary to the canons of the Orthodox Church.
Such liturgical celebration can only create confusion and scandal and serve to
project a false impression of the Christian Faith and the nature of the unity
which God has given to men in His Church, both to the Christian faithful and
to the non-Christians of the world. According to the Orthodox Faith, such
liturgical celebration is also a false presentation of men before the heavenly
altar of God.
”271 It is noteworthy that this letter is issued by bishops272 who
served not in the distant past but “today”
, not in an Orthodox country but in
multiethnic and multicultural America, where Orthodoxy is a minority. These
bishops, following our fathers, declare that the rejection or intentional
overturning of the holy canons forbidding common prayer with heretics has
substantial dogmatic and ecclesiological consequences for the very essence of
our Church.
The Standing Holy Synod of the Church of Greece during its session
on 2.4-9.1999 reiterated the principles of participation of the Church in the
Ecumenical Movement, noting that “She does not participate in common
prayers according to the dictates of the holy canons of the Church.
”273
The Holy Synod of the Church of Greece in its encyclical under the
number 2742/7.3.2002 cites the 45th and 64th apostolic canons, the 9th and
33rd of Laodicea, the 2nd of Antioch, and the 9th of Saint Timothy of
Alexandria. It also states that “the participation of the Orthodox in the ‘holy
Eucharist’ ‘consecrated’ by the heterodox is totally impermissible, not even
‘by economia’ out of need, since there is no canonical provision of any
appropriate ecclesiastical body by which such permission would have been
granted, after the manner in which such ‘economia’ is exercised.
”274
The representative of the Archbishop of Athens, referring to the
refusal of the Church of Greece to participate in the “Inter-religious
Conference in Assisi” in 2002, stated,
“Such gatherings are expressly
forbidden by the holy canons, which we honor and upon which we base our
whole course.
”275
The Holy Synod of the Church of Romania during its convocation on
7.8-9.2008 “condemned the uncanonical acts of two Hierarchs,
276 which also
provoked an uprising within the Church. Further, the Holy Synod took into
consideration the sorrow and repentance they exhibited.
” The Holy Synod
continues in its statement,
“With regard to the sacramental and liturgical
conduct of hierarchs, presbyters, deacons, monastics and laity of the
Romanian Orthodox Church, in relation to other dogmas, based on the holy
canons and Orthodox teaching…under no circumstances is an Orthodox
clergyman permitted to perform mysteries or services with celebrants of other
dogmas. Those that do not obey this decision will dissolve their own
communion with the Orthodox Church and as a result will incur penalties, as
provided by the holy canons, in accordance with their position within the
Church: deposition or defrocking for clergy and the prohibition of the
reception of Holy Communion for the laity.
”277
Finally, at the inter-Orthodox gathering of various Orthodox
autocephalous Churches in Thessaloniki (4.29-5.2.1998), which was
convened by the Ecumenical Patriarchate at the request of the Church of
Serbia with the aim of evaluating the new status quo in the relations of
Orthodoxy with the Ecumenical Movement, the representatives of the
Orthodox Churches affirmed among other things that in the General
Assembly of the WCC in Harare (December 1998) “The Orthodox
participants will not engage in ecumenical prayer gatherings, common
prayers, worship, or other religious ceremonies during the course of the
Assembly.
”278
By the aforementioned examples the opinion that the holy canons do not
apply in the Orthodox Church today is proven to be totally inexact. Many
Orthodox faithful and theologians, many clergy,
279 among them bishops and
archbishops (and the last four Archbishops of Athens!), professors at
theological schools, many monastic brotherhoods and the whole of Mt. Athos
together, contemporary patristic figures, Synods of Local Churches, the
Patriarchal Synod, and even the inter-Orthodox gathering and the Central
Committee of the WCC consider the holy canons to be in full effect today
and as a result common prayers constitute a canonical and ecclesiological
problem. In other words, the contemporary self-consciousness of the Church
has expressed itself time and again, stating that the relevant holy canons are
in effect today, as undesirable as this may be for some! Consequently, those
of a contrary opinion represent only themselves, regardless of the position
they occupy within the Body of our Church.
The above references also indirectly overturn another excuse raised by
some who ignore the canonical tradition of our Church on the matter of
common prayers; citing the scriptural saying “the letter killeth, but the spirit
giveth life,
” in an aphoristic and self-justifying formulation they claim that
only they take care to keep the spirit of the holy canons, although they violate
the letter thereof.
280 The simple question, however, is this: have the
abovementioned professors, bishops, archbishops, patriarchs, and local
synods of Orthodox Churches, which consider common prayers with heretics
impermissible, failed to understand the spirit of the holy canons? Were the
great spiritual personages of Saint Justin Popovich and Fr. John Romanides
unable to grasp the spirit of the holy canons? Did the great canonists and
interpreters and Holy Fathers who applied them not understand the spirit of
the holy canons? And finally, is it a mere coincidence that the same men who
supposedly advocate respect toward the spirit and not the letter of the holy
canons are the very ones that have also proposed the utter retraction of the
same holy canons?
Chapter VI
Why Is Common Prayer Forbidden?
FOR WHAT REASONS IS THE CHURCH SO STRICT and categorical in its prohibition
against common worship with heretics and schismatics, so much so that
common prayer is characterized as “a grave sin” which is penanced with
deposition and excommunication?
Reasons of Faith and Love Toward God. Liturgical,
Ecclesiological, and Dogmatic Aberration.
For the tradition and life of our Church, in other words, for Orthodox
Theology, salvation exists only insofar as a person is incorporated as an
organic member of the “body of Christ”
, in other words the Church, which
has as its head the Lord himself.
281 Certainly the body of Christ that has
existed since the apostolic age down to this day is one, and this is the “One,
Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church,
” the Orthodox Church. There are not
multiple bodies, because there is one Head—Christ. Consequently, the
Divine Liturgy, as well as all of Christian life, is not a personal matter of each
believer but is bound up in the organic unity of all members of the body of
Christ.
“In the theology and in the life of the Orthodox Church there is always an
unbreakable relationship between dogma and worship, between theology and
prayer. Orthodox worship and prayer are not ‘chapters’ independent of the
faith of the Church, but are rather a liturgical expression of the one and
indissoluble dogmatic teaching of the Church. Lex orandi, lex credendi was
always an inviolable rule, which outlined the Orthodox ethos… Dogma as
much as the Christian way of life become discernible within the liturgical
context… This means that common prayer is suitable for as many as also
partake in the same faith,
”282 as Professor Scouteris correctly notes. Even in
the WCC, there is recognition of the fact that “there is a deep and direct
relationship between theology and prayer. The ancient saying lex orandi, lex
credenti states that we pray that which we believe. The dogma of a church is
expressed in her liturgical life.
”283
The center and essence of Christian worship is the Divine Liturgy, into
which flow the other services and Mysteries of our Church.
284 Saint
Dionysius the Areopagite writes,
“It is nearly impossible for any hierarchal
ceremony to be celebrated if the most Divine Eucharist is not being
celebrated.
”285 In other words, the Divine Liturgy is not simply one of the
prayers of the Church but rather the foundation and pinnacle of each
particular part of Orthodox worship. The Holy Eucharist ties together all of
sacred worship and in essence reveals the Church itself: “The Church is
signified in the mysteries,
”286 says Saint Nicholas Cabasilas, referring to the
Divine Liturgy. In other words, the Holy Eucharist is not a means of
achieving Christian unity among people but is unity itself, the manifestation
of the already accomplished unity in the One Body of Christ.
287 For this
reason also in the Divine Liturgy and by extension in all of sacred worship,
only those that have been integrated into the body of Christ through Baptism
and that remain therein may participate. Even catechumens who were
preparing to be baptized were unable to remain and follow along. According
to Orthodox ecclesiology, any form of intercommunion is altogether
inconceivable,
288 since the matter of Eucharistic communion, ecclesiological
communion, and communion in faith are interwoven.
289
So, since heresy is the rejection, the severance, and (in the final analysis)
the denial of participation in the Church, the “body of Christ,
” participation
in worship is not only meaningless but inconceivable. How can I participate
in worship, in other words in the manifestation of the unity of the body of
Christ, when I have chosen to break off and not belong to it? For the one
outside the Church—be he heretic or schismatic—it is at least a matter of
consistency that he would not want to be considered a member of the body,
since, in the final analysis, he has consciously chosen to break off from it!
Reasonably and naturally Nikephorus Gregoras asks,
“Therefore, since
the disposition is battling here and the dogmatic innovation is separating us
from each other, how could we have a single head (Christ), or how could we
pray together with each other?”290 Similarly, Zonaras asks: “Those falling
into heresies and remaining in them, are ostracized from the Church as
foreign to her. How can they be permitted to enter into the house of God?”291
And professor Scouteris rightly wonders,
“The question that is often asked
(by certain Orthodox) is what meaning does an ‘artificial’ common prayer
have, if this prayer does not express a unified ethos but is instead a merging
of elements from various ecclesiastical traditions? If prayer is a genuine
doxological expression of ecclesiastical teaching and life, then what common
faith and what common ethos can common prayer (with the heterodox)
express?”292
Only if we reckon Orthodox Worship as a spectacle, devoid of any
substantial personal participation, can the presence of the non-Orthodox
within it be legitimated. In other words, the participation of heretics in the
Divine Liturgy is a subversion of its very essence; it is a liturgical aberration.
Furthermore, a necessary presupposition for us to participate in common
worship is an agreement of faith.
293 Saint Irenaeus relates as much: “Our
belief [the Orthodox faith] is in one accord with the Eucharist, and the
Eucharist affirms the belief…We offer up our own to him [God],
harmoniously proclaiming and confessing communion and union.
”294
According to Metropolitan of Pergamon John Zizioulas,
“Orthodoxy
without the Eucharist is inconceivable,
” but also “the Eucharist without
Orthodoxy is impossible… The presupposition of Orthodoxy for the
participation in the unity of the Eucharist certainly existed in the past within
the Church, as is witnessed in the confessions of faith embodied within the
liturgical texts.
”295 This liturgical tradition stretches even to our own day and
demands before the Anaphora the confession of a common and uncorrupted
faith, by means of the recitation of the Creed.
296 Therefore since “unity in the
Holy Eucharist is combined with unity in Orthodoxy,
”297 any common prayer
with a heretic constitutes a liturgical aberration.
It is obvious, then, that for our Church the liturgical space cannot be used
as a place of mere communication and social interaction, but constitutes an
existential element, touching upon Her very nature. In this context we can
interpret “the repulsion which the Orthodox were feeling against the common
performance of the Divine Liturgy with the heterodox, with whom, at least in
appearance, they had just concorded the Union (of Ferrara-Florence),
”298 or
the refusal of St. Alexander of Constantinople to co-liturgize with Arius.
299
For the consciousness of the saints, there is no room for social politeness and
gentility in worship: the reception and common prayer in church with
representatives of the heretical “synagogue,
” as if he were a canonical bishop,
cannot be accepted ecclesiologically, for this would be to legalize heresy. The
recognition, within worship, of heresy as another “Church,
” which exists
lawfully—from an ecclesiastical perspective—and in parallel with the “One,
Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church” constitutes the basis for the adoption
of the branch theory,
300 which leads to an ecclesiological aberration.
Finally, when one assents to common prayer with heretics without
qualifications or limitations and overlooking the numerous and substantial
differences over matters of faith, in practice he rejects the struggles of the
Church and of her saints for the preservation of our faith against innovation,
underestimates the value of right dogma, and finally equates the Truth with
delusion. In other words, he regards deluded teaching as another lawful
version and possible interpretation of the Gospel Truth.
301 Such an approach
to ecclesiastical life certainly also leads to dogmatic aberration.
In summary: the strict stance of the Holy Fathers toward common prayers
with heretics is a consequence of their teaching regarding the Church.
Reasons of Love Toward Man: Pastoral Aberration
The basis of Christian ethics is love toward the other, whoever he may be,
and this highest of virtues was served by the saints of our Church. This love
was not only declared through their care in covering material needs but
primarily for the liberation of their fellow-man from the bonds of delusion
and falsehood, since what does it profit a man to gain the whole world but
live his whole life in error, with false hope and a flawed outlook? Put
differently, the work of the Church and of the saints is not the solution of
social ills or a dignified life for the people, but mainly the overcoming of the
final enemy of man—death—through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. In a
letter of the Holy Monastery of Stavronikita on Mount Athos which is signed
by Fr. Vasileios (Gontikakis, the abbot at that time [1968]) and by Saint
Paisios, among other things it is noted that “The Fathers of the Church who
appeared ‘harsh’ in the observation of dogma are those who loved their
fellow man more than anything. Since they recognized his unfathomable
depths, they did not want to mock him through niceties and empty love, but
they honored him by the Gospel of Truth, which grants the blessed life in the
Holy Spirit. Rigid adherence to dogma is therefore not narrow-mindedness,
nor is the struggle for Orthodoxy bigotry, but rather this is the sole means of
authentic love. Lived-out Orthodoxy gives to the world ‘the one thing
needful’
, that for which it truly thirsts.
”302
This ministry of love “in truth”303 and truth “in love”304 is served by the
strict adherence of the saints to the deposit of faith which they received and to
its exact and unerring transmission within history. For this reason, we find
much caution exercised in the formulation of dogma and much strictness
toward its counterfeiters, the heretics. According to Theodore Yiangou,
“all
of these canonical provisions have an intensely pastoral character. The
Church was aiming at safeguarding the ecclesiastical eucharistic body,
especially in times when there was a danger of departing from the truth.
These are positions that express the struggle and agony of the Church for the
safeguarding of upright dogma and simultaneously the pastoral care for the
protection of the people of God. These theological and pastoral concerns
required the Church to issue provisions which are characterized by
strictness.
”305
Unfortunately, however, not only have the pastoral considerations which
necessitated these canons not subsided, but on the contrary the dangers have
increased. Rightly does the Committee of the Holy Community of Mount
Athos on Dogmatics emphasize in its Memorandum “Regarding the
Participation of the Orthodox Church in the World Council of Churches” that
“The pastoral dimension of the holy canons renders meaningful their
application in the time when they were written as well as today. None of us
flees for refuge to these holy canons, unless he see that the dogmatic
consciousness of the Church is endangered by some heretical ecclesiology.
And today, more than ever, the dogmatic conscience of the plēroma of the
Church is in danger of being altered by the ecclesiology being cultivated by
the WCC. Common prayers are only one component of this ecclesiological
alteration. Whoever suppose that we cite the validity of these particular holy
canons out of conservatism or fundamentalism are mistaken. They ignore the
fact that the Church issued such canons however often it witnessed the
ecclesiological consciousness of its members being altered. Today it is
necessary to emphasize the relevant extant canons and, if necessary, to create
newer ones in the same spirit, for the same purpose, and with a specific
reference to the WCC.
”306
Love towards the faithful
The Church, then, in prohibiting common prayers with heretics wishes to
safeguard her own members, and indeed those weaker in faith, from “spiritual
confusion”307
—the delusion of heresy.
Regarding those who can easily be swayed in their faith through contact
with heretics, Saint Nectarius cautions: “External excommunication guards
against internal estrangement.
”308
There is “estrangement” whenever any of the following takes place:
• The believer denies the Gospel Truth and enters into demonic
delusion.
• His Orthodox sensitivity is corrupted and he ceases to discern between
truth and falsehood.
• He considers the Church and heresy to be equally valid approaches to
God.
• He thinks that Orthodoxy and other heretical confessions honour
Christ in an equally pleasing manner.
309
• He considers the “one Church” to be one among many “others”
.
• He equates Orthodoxy with the denial thereof.
310
Many times, however, those praying in common with heretics are
distinguished theologians or bishops possessing great theological education:
they are “strong and fervent and firm in the faith,
”311 on which basis they are
presumably in no risk of “estrangement.
” When there is no such fear, is
perhaps common prayer with heretics permissible?
Definitely not, since, among other reasons:
• This behavior of theirs is sure to dull, in the conscience of their flock,
“the notion that heresy is totally incompatible with the Truth of the
Church and is a cause of the loss of souls…If the shepherds of the
Church adopt a syncretistic stance toward heresy, the…flock will lose
its confessional sensitivity and will easily fall into heresy.
”312
• Furthermore, this behavior on the part of the shepherd is contrary to
the holy canons,
“for even if he does not believe their [the heretics’]
beliefs, nevertheless he is at least giving many a cause for scandal and
creates against himself suspicion,
”313 “because he is thought to be of
one mind with the unbelievers”314 or “as one causing the suspicion
that he believes things similar to what they believe.
”315 Such an
impression, even if it be false, that a bishop or theologian is “of one
mind with unbelievers,
” that he agrees with or accepts heresy or does
not “rightly divide the word of truth,
” becomes an occasion for the
“estrangement” of the faithful and then…
“woe to that man by whom
the scandal cometh.
”316 Woe to the shepherds who with their careless
actions shake the trust of the people in the Hierarchy and scandalize
them! When in fact the situation escalates and these violations become
cause for schism from the body of Christ,
317 then does the “strong”
yet heedless shepherd have no responsibility? By contrast, the
observance of the holy canons protects us all and does harm to no one.
Love towards heretics
Perhaps at first glance it seem like a paradox to say that the prohibition
against common prayer with heretics comes from the love of the Church
toward them. However,
St. John Chrysostom is clear: “Genuine love is shown not by the sharing
of a common table, neither with lofty words, nor flattery, but by the
correction and the seeking of the good of one’s neighbor…
”318 And Saint
Maximus notes,
“I indeed define the attempt to give strength to delusion unto
the greater destruction of those already captured by it to be misanthropy and
separation from the divine love.
”319 When I completely accept the heretic
into common prayer, as if he were a canonical member of the Church, as if he
were not living far from the Truth, is there not a certainty that he will remain
complacent and continue in his error? Do I not appear to agree with him that
outside of the “One Church” there can be a healthy and salvific relationship
with our Lord? Is there any chance that this behaviour of mine would cause
him to reconsider his choice?
When, however, in love, discernment and respect of his person, I explain
to him the difficulties which—unfortunately—exist and hinder our spiritual
contact and above all our appearance before the Lord in common prayer, if he
is of a good disposition, are there not greater hopes that our fellow man will
appreciate our conduct and will benefit substantially? Certainly he will
become upset (as we will become as well), but perhaps this sorrow might be
turned into joy?
As many of us as have visited Mt. Athos320 have experienced how the
heterodox receive the love of our Church which is hidden behind this
strictness, and the heterodox in no wise misunderstand this.
321 By contrast,
we may have elsewhere tasted the consequences of flaccidity and of ignoring
the canonical tradition of our Church.
In the final analysis, by ignoring age-old ecclesiastical order do we
believe that we are showing more love than does our Mother the Church and
our saints? Let us at least reflect on this!
Love towards the heterodox in theological dialogue
As has already been highlighted, common prayers are not a necessary
component of the process of inter-Christian dialogue. Quite the contrary in
fact: common prayers happening in violation of the holy canons not only do
not benefit the Ecumenical Movement and the work of unification and
reconciliation but instead destroy it (a) by subsequently obscuring matters
and by lulling the heterodox with empty hopes, and (b) by provoking a strong
reaction on the part of significant constituents of the Orthodox Church (e.g.
hierarchs, Mt. Athos, monasteries, clergy, theologians) but also of great
numbers of the faithful,
322 who look upon the journey toward the Common
Cup with great distaste and skepticism, even suspicion;323 since in the end,
who would disagree that “the Union of two Churches is not a question of the
concord of perspectives of a few or many people, but of identity of the faith
of the entirely of each of them. As the Metropolitan of Athens Meletios most
epigrammatically noted in London in 1919, the Union ‘must not be a mere
agreement between hierarchs, but a union of the faith and hearts of the
people’
”324
.
On the other hand, if Orthodox clergy were “as hesitant as possible in the
liturgical gatherings with the heterodox as being antithetical to the holy
canons and dulling the confessional sensitivity of the Orthodox”
, just as the
Patriarchal Synod around Patriarch Athenagoras was recommending, would
they not gain the understanding of their heterodox interlocutors? Would the
theological dialogue perhaps risk being interrupted by cause of this consistent
and honorable tactic? Certainly not!
Could it be, though, that some are only interested in the realization of the
“union of the Churches” at all costs? And that as the only way forward they
have chosen the theory-strategy,
“put forth by certain Roman Catholic
participants” in the Second Vatican Council, that “union will be realized
gradually, not through ecclesiastical-theological negotiations, in three stages:
1) friendship and psychological preparation, 2) partial sacramental
communion, and 3) full sacramental communion”?325 Or does perhaps
ignoring the canonical order of our Church not lead to that end?326
Chapter VII
Conclusions
IN CONCLUSION, WE SEE THAT THE CANONICAL TRADITION OF our Church clearly,
categorically, and without reservation declares that “one must not join in
prayer with heretics or schismatics.
” Neither can such prayer be accepted by
economia. Ignoring the canons bears severe penances, excommunication for
laity and deposition for clergy. This strictness has a theological and
ecclesiological foundation and a pastoral aim. It stems from the very self-
awareness of our One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church which cannot
endure the equation of Truth with the denial thereof, but which is motivated
by love toward “those near and those far,
”327 proclaiming the Truth but also
drawing attention to any misrepresentations and distortions.
Unfortunately today, in the era of institutionalized confusion and the
absolutization of relativism, many would seek the dulling of the Orthodox
self-awareness and the presentation of her as being on equal terms with
heresy and error. They want to slander the authentic witness of the Church of
Christ as being fanatical, fundamentalistic, and as egotistical self-indulgence,
anachronistic and out-of-place.
The Orthodox Church, however, is obliged to forge the difficult road of
her martyrdom with her gaze averted away from the contemporary world,
basing herself rather upon Her Tradition and experience. This experience is
recorded in the Holy Scriptures, in the lives of her saints, in the teaching of
the Fathers, and in the pronouncements and canons of her councils.
The witness of Orthodoxy is needful today more than ever. The Orthodox
Church has no right to be silent. She is obliged to give her witness to the faith
“once delivered to the saints”328 within the contemporary context of inter-
Christian communication and collaboration.
329 This collaboration, however,
cannot but be founded upon our respect for the Church’s canonical tradition.
We must determine our general pastoral responsibility to the Body of Christ
by the criterion “What does the canonical order of our Church command?”
,
since the holy canons are not human opinions but fruits of the Holy Spirit.
According to Fr. Epiphanios Theodoropoulos,
“Only through the faithful and
unaltered observation of the holy canons is the Church governed in a
theanthropic and not a human way. Whatever is not built upon the foundation
of the holy canons is founded upon sand, and, however artful it may be,
sooner or later it will break apart and be dashed to mere planks. Every
overturning of established ecclesiastical realities, however well-intentioned it
may be, insofar as it seeks to side-step the holy canons, is incapable of
attracting the blessing of Heaven.
”330
The work of reconciliation in the inter-Christian world has first and
foremost need of the blessing of Heaven. It is not an accomplishment of
diplomatic compromise and mutual concessions in the formulation of
commonly acceptable but ambiguous terms and texts which present a
manufactured and superficial agreement. It is a question of essential, real and
true communion which is only achievable with the Grace of the Holy Spirit.
For this unity in Christ, in other words, in Truth and Love, does the
Church pray, so that the apocalyptic vision, which is nothing other than the
prayer of all of redeemed creation before the heavenly altar, may, as much as
possible, take place in history: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude,
which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white
robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying,
Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And
all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders and the four
beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying,
Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and
power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen… Even so,
come, Lord Jesus!”331
Appendix to the Second Edition
Introduction
THE POSITIVE RECEPTION OF THE FIRST EDITION UNDER THE title One Must Not
Join in Prayer with Heretics or Schismatics (Patras 2008) by bishops, clergy,
professors of theological schools and other faithful was especially moving.
Of course, as author, I am fully aware that the congratulations and positive
comments do not so much concern the quality of the book as such, but are
mainly directed toward its title. These congratulations stem from the
discontent which plagues the hearts of the faithful on account of the things
they see being consolidated around them, and they point toward something
much more essential: this is yet another opportunity for the confession of
faith within our ages-old Church Tradition; it is a message to those in charge
that they should not tamper with that which is not to be tampered with. Let
me use the words of an erudite metropolitan, who, after communicating to the
author,
“with decorous seriousness, Orthodox confessional consistence,
canonical firmness, replete bibliographical documentation…you have given
us an Orthodox ecclesiological analysis of the topic,
” concludes,
“What is
noteworthy is that the voices multiply, voices sober, prudent, having
understanding and firm but not fanatical zeal, from among both the clergy
and the laity, that is, the totality of the Church, which declare the vigilant
conscience of the body of the Church.
”
Another bishop, a close co-worker of the Archbishop of Athens,
characteristically stresses,
“I wish to express to you my heartfelt thanks and
simultaneously to congratulate you on behalf of your struggle for Orthodoxy.
We must sadly confess that we are not following the line that the Holy
Fathers have set forth and the situation has reached a very ugly point. We can
only hope that the mercy of God will save us. Do not waver. Continue your
effort. God sees and rewards. Take no heed of what people do.
”
Allow me to mention that with great emotion and surprise I received the
warm congratulations of a leader of an Autocephalous Orthodox Church as
well as of a Metropolitan of the Ecumenical Throne, who with exceptional
clarity and enviable boldness notes that among other things this work “is a
message that should awaken us all, so that the unfruitful—as has been shown
many years now—and harmful inter-Christian gatherings and common
prayers may cease as soon as possible, that the fruitless dialogue with the vast
medley of heretics may come to a close, so that it may become possible for
the gates of repentance to be opened unto all these peo-ple for their return
into the only true and salvific holy Church of Christ, the Orthodox one. I
congratulate you for your holy concerns and I hope your example is followed
by all of us, especially by the upper clergy which bears responsibility for all
that erroneously takes place.
” Truly the light of Christ burns at the Phanar!332
Certainly there are others who will not agree not only with the
conclusions of the work, but not even with its title! These have almost all
remained silent… They did not wish to muster the least theological
opposition to the ages-old Church Tradition. Some of them (they cannot be
specified) assigned to Professor Vlasios Pheidas the production of a scientific
and theological exoneration of all that is uncanonically taking place at
ecumenical gatherings with regard to common prayers. The extensive opinion
piece of the professor (23 pages long) with the title “The Issue of Common
Prayer with the Heterodox According to the Holy Canons” was published in
Episkepsis, the official publication of the Center of the Ecumenical
Patriarchate in Chambesy, Geneva (issue 699/4.30.2009).
333 Worth noting is
the great length of the article which is not customary for Episkepsis!
This opinion piece was “utilised” immediately. Fr. George Tsetsis, Grand
Protopresbyter of the Ecumenical Throne and representative to the WCC, in
his announcement dated 6.3.2009 in reaction to the “Confession of Faith
Against Ecumenism”334 (which also condemned common prayers)
emphatically remarked,
“As to the question of whether or not common
prayers [and not concelebration] with heterodox are forbidden, see the recent
thoroughly researched study by Professor Vlasios Pheidas in the journal
Episkepsis.
” And certainly, in the future, this study will be “utilised” even
more with the dangerous and levelling rationale that “since Pheidas said so, it
must be so…
”
The publication of the article in the official publication of the Ecumenical
Patriarchate and indeed the mobilization of a professor of Pheidas’s stature to
produce a theological basis for common prayers with the heterodox
demonstrates beyond a doubt that the reactions of the faithful (bishops,
clergy, theologians, and laity) to the violation of canonical tradition has been
duly noted by the ecumenistic circles within Orthodoxy,
335 despite their
apparent indifference and the disregard they wish to show toward protests…
The opinion piece of Professor Pheidas did not live up to the professional
reputation of its writer and certainly did not achieve its desired end. A close
reading not only does not convince one as to the correctness of the
professor’s conclusions, but instead confirms the prohibition against common
prayer with heretics according to canonical tradition. Mr. Pheidas did not
manage to validate his claims within the ages-old ecclesiastical tradition. This
failure is due certainly not to any lack of scientific erudition and instruction
on the part of the professor—far from it—but rather on the one hand to the
strict, absolute and oft-attested prohibition against common prayers to be
found within canonical sources, and on the other hand to the total lack of
examples within Church history of Church Fathers praying with the
originators of heresies, as long as they remained in error. It is impossible for
anyone who respects these sources to arrive at different conclusions.
Despite the fact that this issue is totally clear within the tradition of our
Church, since my estimation—would that I be wrong—is that the publication
of the opinion piece in Episkepsis serves to grant amnesty for canonical
violations committed by clergy whose duty it is to observe the canonical
order and tradition of our Church (besides, they have given oaths at their
ordinations), being encouraged to do so I proceeded to write a critique of
Professor Pheidas’s article.
Respect toward my professor did not allow me to remain silent, since I
believe that a lack of respect is demonstrated only in disdain and never in an
effort toward a documented objection regarding serious theological issues
which arise. Furthermore, I supposed—perhaps mistakenly—that the timing
of the opinion-piece’s commissioning was not unrelated to the publication of
my work, On Common Prayer with the Heterodox (Patras, December 2008)
and of another similar work by Archimandrite Cyr. Kostopolous. I considered
that it constituted, though it goes unmentioned (besides, it could not be
mentioned), an indirect response to On Common Prayer with the Heterodox.
My critique of the professor’s article was immediately sent to Episkepsis
for publication, but it is unlikely to be published by them. Additionally, it
was sent digitally to Fr. G. Tsetsis (by whom I was informed about the
opinion piece) and to Professor Pheidas. Professor Pheidas judged I was not
worthy of any response. With Fr. George Tsetsis a correspondence followed.
We include here the correspondence with Fr. George Tsetsis because of the
stature of his personage (Grand Protopresbyter of the Ecumenical Throne)
and of the critical position he maintains toward the Ecumenical Movement
(as permanent representative of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the WCC), so
that the reader may come to his own conclusions.
The critique of the Professor Pheidas’s article was published in
Theodromia (issue 2/2009), in Orthodoxos Typos (1792/7.17.2009), in
Ecclēsiologio (July-August 2009) and excerpts appeared in Parakatathēkē
(issue 66/2009) and Peiraïkē Ecclēsia (September 2009). In addition, it saw
widespread circulation online.
336 I therefore close by including 1) My
commentary on professor Pheidas’s article and 2) The relevant
correspondence with Fr. George Tsetsis.
Critique of the Article of Professor Vlasios Pheidas: “The Issue
of Common Prayer with the Heterodox According to the Holy
Canons”
An article by Professor Vlasios Pheidas under the title “The Issue of
Common Prayer with Heterodox According to the Holy Canons”337
(henceforth: Pheidas) was published in Episkepsis (issue 699/4.30.2009, pp.
11-33). As the writer states, this article constitutes an opinion-piece or
response to the question addressed to him.
The publication of such a lengthy work (23 pages long) in the official
publication of the Orthodox Center of the Ecumenical Patriarchate
(Chambesy, Geneva) and the stature and critical traits possessed by its author
demonstrate the seriousness of the issue of common prayers with the
heterodox for contemporary inter-Orthodox and inter-Christian cooperation.
In the article, the professor concludes that not only is common prayer
with the heterodox within the context of the Ecumenical Movement not
forbidden, but conversely, the holy canons encourage common prayer with
other confessions, the canonical prohibition being limited to the Divine
Liturgy.
Professor Pheidas’s arguments chiefly hinge upon the following points:
the “exact interpretation according to the letter” of the canons (Pheidas, p.
15), the “consistent relation of the spirit of the canon to specific ecclesiastical
problems of a specific era” and more specifically “to the circumstances of the
fourth century that posed a danger for the unity of the Church” (Pheidas, p.
15), Roman Catholics and Protestants have not been condemned as heretics,
and Joint prayers as “an inescapable result” of the Ecumenical Movement.
The Meaning of συνεύχεσθαι
Professor Pheidas in examining the “exact interpretation according to the
letter” of the holy canons concludes,
“consequently, it is easy to understand
that the 55th and subsequent relevant apostolic canons always tie
“συνεύχεσθαι” to acts of concelebration and common officiation of Orthodox
clergy with heretics” (Pheidas, p. 19) and “consequently, the true meaning of
the above canons (which forbid joint prayer with heretics) refers solely to the
reasonable and self-evident prohibition against concelebration between
Orthodox and heterodox clergy and certainly not to their participation in any
other prayer” (Pheidas, p.20). In other words, he limits the meaning of
common prayer exclusively and solely to the Divine Liturgy and not to any
other service.
These conclusions are obviously inaccurate since—as will be
demonstrated—the meaning of συνεύχεσθαι in the holy canons is much
broader and includes the simple prayers of laity outside the temple “at home
or in fields” but also the performing of the Divine Liturgy before the holy
altar by the clergy. In no way can it be limited to the participation of clergy in
the Divine Liturgy.
The meaning of συνεύχεσθαι in secular and patristic literature
In Ancient Greek Literature, according to the dictionary of Ioannis
Stamatakos, συνεύχομαι means “I pray in common with someone, I unite my
prayers with his.
”338 In patristic literature, according to G.W.H. Lampe339
“‘συμπροσεύχομαι’ means ‘pray together, pray with’”
, whereas,
‘συνεύχομαι’ means a) ‘pray with, pray together’ and b) ‘wish one well’
.
In the New Testament, only the verb ‘εὔχεσθαι’ is encountered,
340 which
in no instance implies the performing of the Divine Liturgy, but rather only
prayer or a mere wish. References in the Septuagint are similar.
As a result, the claim that ‘συνεύχομαι’ or ‘συμπροσεύχομαι’ refer
exclusively not to simple common prayers but to the performing of the
Divine Liturgy is not supported either by the Holy Scriptures or by secular or
patristic literature.
The meaning of συνεύχεσθαι in the holy canons
It is obvious that when the authors of the holy canons wish to distinguish or
limit the definition of a term or to grant it a different meaning from that
which it typically bears within biblical and patristic literature, they are
required to do so with the utmost precision and exactitude. Nothing of the
sort occurs with regard to συνεύχεσθαι and its related terms. An exception is
the 8th canon of St. Timothy of Alexandria, who limits the meaning of
εὔχεσθαι and εὐχή only to the Holy Anaphora of the Divine Liturgy, saying,
“Whether a Clergyman ought to pray [εὔχεσθαι]…or…when he himself is
making the prayer [εὐχήν], that is to say, the offering?” The phrase “that is to
say” precisely qualifies the intention of the author when he speaks of
“praying” and “prayer”
. If εὔχεσθαι and εὐχή always referred to the Divine
Liturgy, the clarification would not be necessary.
In most holy canons forbidding joint prayer with heretics it is nowhere
stipulated that the prohibition applies only to clergy. In some, in fact,
penances are expressly provided for those laymen that violate the canonical
prohibition against joint prayers. As a result, it should be noted that
συνεύχεσθαι also includes mere prayer, since laity can only conduct simple
prayers in common, being unable to concelebrate.
Especially important in understanding which prayer with heretics is
prohibited is the 65th (or 64th according to Rallis-Potlis [henceforth: RP])
apostolic canon: “If any clergyman, or layman, enter a synagogue of Jews, or
of heretics, to pray, let him be both deposed and excommunicated.
”
Unfortunately this important canon escaped the attention of the professor (or
did it?), who does not analyze it in the article! And this canon alone overturns
the erroneous contention of the article-writer that “the relevant apostolic
canons always connect συνεύχεσθαι solely with acts of concelebration or co-
officiation of Orthodox clergy with heretics” (Pheidas, p.19) and
“consequently, the true meaning of the above canons (forbidding joint
prayers with heretics) refers solely to the reasonable and self-evident
prohibition against concelebration between Orthodox and heterodox clergy
and certainly not to their participation in any other prayer” (Pheidas, p. 20).
When the 65th apostolic canon forbids the “entering…to pray” it certainly
does not mean concelebration, since a common Divine Liturgy with the Jews
in their synagogue is inconceivable!
The same can be said for the 37th canon of Laodicea,
“That one must not
accept holiday tokens sent by Jews or heretics, nor celebrate any holiday
along with them.
” Neither does this receive any mention in the article. It is
evident that within the concept of ‘celebrating together’ is included every
liturgical service and ceremony—and certainly the Divine Liturgy also, but
not alone—in honor of any person or event which is celebrated by the Jews
or heretics.
It is noteworthy that the feasts of the Jews and heretics are treated with a
singular prohibition.
Canon 2 of Antioch (also omitted from the article) is equally clear:
“communion with those excluded from communion is not allowed, nor at
private homes is it to be allowed to assemble and pray with those who do not
pray with the church.
” Obviously,
‘communion’ refers to the Holy Eucharist
and is distinguished from assembling in private homes and praying together,
whereby mere prayer is implied. The performance of a Divine Liturgy is not
implied by “at private homes…to assemble and pray” on the one hand
because performing a Divine Liturgy in a home without necessity is
forbidden by the 58th canon of Laodicea, and on the other hand because it
would not make sense to repeat a prohibition against performing a Divine
Liturgy within the same canon.
In accordance with the 10th apostolic canon,
“If any one shall pray, even
in a private house, with an excommunicated person, let him also be
excommunicated.
” When the canon extends excommunication to whoever
“prays, even in a private house,
” with an excommunicate (heretic or merely
excommunicated),
341 it obviously means mere common prayer and not the
performing of the Divine Liturgy, since, as has already been stated, without
there being a need, the performance of a Divine Liturgy “in a private house”
is strictly forbidden. Furthermore, the very structure of the text implies that it
does not apply to a eucharistic assembly, but to simple individual prayer.
Therefore, the phrase “if any one shall pray, even in a private house,
” implies
any sort of prayer; let the violator of this canon “be excommunicated”!
We must necessarily pause to examine the interpretation offered by the
professor to the 8th canon of St. Timothy of Alexandria where he
(erroneously) concludes,
“furthermore, Arians and other heretics are able to
stand alongside Orthodox clergy in performing the Divine Liturgy at least
‘until the kiss [of peace]’” (Pheidas, p. 20) and “wherefore…it ‘does not
harm…at all’ for there to be a gathering of Orthodox and heretics during the
Divine Liturgy” (Pheidas, p.21). Nothing of the sort, however, can be gleaned
from the text of the canon: “Question: Whether a Clergyman ought to pray
when Arians or other heretics are present, or it does not harm him at all, at a
time when he himself is making the prayer, that is to say, the offering?
Answer: In the divine anaphora, or offering, the Deacon addresses before the
embrace the congregation, saying: ‘Those of ye who are not in communion,
take a walk.
’ There ought not, therefore, to be any persons present such as
those mentioned, unless they promise to repent and to leave the heresy.
” St.
Timothy is asked, in other words, whether during the time of the Holy
Anaphora in the Divine Liturgy which an Orthodox clergyman is performing
it is permissible for Arians or other heretics to be present. It is evident from
the structure of the question that the “pray [εὔχεσθαι]” of the first section is
explained in the second part of the question with the phrase “when he himself
is making the prayer, that is to say, the offering.
” From this text it is clear that
the question regards the highest moment of the Holy Anaphora and nowhere
within the question is a distinction of the Divine Liturgy into two parts
implied. The Divine Liturgy is treated as a whole and not as two parts.
Balsamon expresses the same view regarding the approach to the Divine
Liturgy as a whole: “The question regarding a clergyman, whether he ought
to pray in the presence of heretics, that is, to offer the bloodless sacrifice”
(RP, 4, 336). Saint Nikodemos the Hagiorite also approaches this question in
the same way: “This father has been questioned whether the priest should
offer the bloodless officiation when Arians or simply heretics are present.
”
Likewise Blastaris makes no distinction between the parts of the Divine
Liturgy (RP 6, 73). Additionally, within his answer, Saint Timothy makes no
reference to a differentiation in behavior toward heretics in the two parts of
the Divine Liturgy. If he meant something of the sort, he would have had to
say so expressly. The response of the Patriarch of Alexandria is simple, clear,
and uniform: they “ought not to be present…unless they promise to repent
and to leave the heresy.
” Nowhere does he say that in the first part of Divine
Liturgy they can follow along and during the second part it is forbidden.
Nothing of the sort can be supported by the text of St. Timothy, nor by its
interpreters. Further, Professor Pheidas citing Balsamon says: “Consequently,
the canon [6th of Laodicea] forbids the gathering in church of those that
persist in heresy together with the Orthodox during the performance of the
Divine Liturgy” (Pheidas, p. 19), without distinguishing between the parts of
the Divine Liturgy, during the first half of which (supposedly) their presence
is permitted, while in the second half it is forbidden.
It is worth underscoring that the professor himself, in explicating the
comment of Balsamon on the 45th apostolic canon, recognizes that with the
phrase “συνευξάμενος” the canon implies “participation in prayer” in
contradistinction to “concelebration”: “Here do not think that the bishop and
the others prayed in common with heretics in a temple (=concelebration); for
such men will be deposed…But understand the ‘prayed in common
[συνεύξασθαι]’ to mean simply mere association [τό ἁπλῶς κοινωνῆσαι] and
becoming more gently disposed toward the prayer of the heretic
(=participation in prayer)” (Pheidas, p. 17).
342
Finally, Professor Pheidas concurs rightly that in the case of mere joint
prayer with a heretic and not concelebration the penalty of excommunication
is called for by the 45th apostolic canon: “Consequently, the verb
‘συνεύχεσθαι’ refers to two different situations, either mere joint prayer or
concelebration, wherefore in the second instance the suggested penalty of
deposition is obviously more severe,
” whereas in the first case of “mere
common prayer” only the penalty of excommunication is called for (Pheidas,
p. 17). Despite all this, in what follows he does not consider the canon’s
prohibition of “mere common prayer” under penalty of excommunication to
be worth mentioning. He passes over it in silence.
Distinguished canonists on “συνεύχεσθαι”:
Theodore Balsamon
(“Distinguished canonist” according to Pheidas [p.17] and “most renowned
exegete of the holy canons”
, according to Constantine Oikonomos). It should
be noted that the professor himself attests that “the distinguished canonist
Theodore Balsamon in his commentary on the 45th apostolic canon…
correctly observes the diverse usage of the term συνεύχεσθαι’
, which is
shown also by the difference in the proscribed ecclesiastical penalties”
(Pheidas, p. 17)! Considering this, one wonders how in his conclusions he
overlooks the “correct observation” of Balsamon and, totally without cause,
limits the meaning of “συνεύχεσθαι” only to the Divine Liturgy and to
concelebration!
Furthermore, according to Balsamon:
“The one who prays in common with an excommunicate in any place is
himself excommunicated, whether he be a bishop or a layman… He will not
be accused of whether he chants together with him in a home or in a field,
since praying together with the excommunicated is the same whether within
the church or outside of it. But from conversing with the excommunicated we
are not hindered.
”343 Balsamon is totally clear: he who “prays in common,
”
“in any place” always does so uncanonically, whether he be a bishop or
layman. Consequently, this is not a case of concelebration. Merely chanting
together as a form of common prayer can occur at home or outdoors. It makes
no difference whether it is performed before the ecclesiastical community “in
church” or, according to the same canon,
“outside of it.
” It is obvious that
Balsamon is not referring exclusively to the Divine Liturgy and
concelebration, but to any form of prayer.
“Here [in Canon 45], do not think
that the bishop and the others prayed in common with heretics in a temple
(for such men will be deposed according to Canon 46, along with the one that
permitted them to perform any service as clergymen), but understand the
‘prayed in common [συνεύξασθαι]’ to mean mere association [τό ἁπλῶς
κοινωνῆσαι] and becoming more gently disposed toward the prayer of the
heretic” (RP., 2, 60). (According to Pheidas, this last clause refers to
participation in prayer [p. 17].) Put simply, Balsamon is saying: the 45th
canon does not refer to the case of a bishop praying with a heretic inside a
church. This case, of common prayer between a bishop and heretics, even if
permission is given to the heretics to act as clergy, is dealt with in the 46th
canon more strictly with deposition. Here, in the 45th canon, understand
“praying in common [συνεύξασθαι]” as meaning mere liturgical contact and
simple prayer, without priestly acts by clergy, and for this reason we have
only excommunication here. As a result, according to Balsamon,
“praying in
common [συνεύξασθαι]” means mere prayer, even outside a temple, without
any priestly officiation, without the performance of a Divine Liturgy.
“For this reason [he cites the canons which forbid common prayers with
heretics], we also vote that both the laymen and the clergymen that pray in
common with heretics within a church of the Orthodox or of heretics, or pray
with them in any place in a priestly fashion, or even eat with them, be
subjected not only to excommunication and deposition but also be punished
in ways greater still, in accordance with the summary of the said divine
canons. For the narrowness of these lands and the multiplication of the
heretics has not changed the integrity of the Orthodox faith” (RP, 4, 460).
Laymen are also subjected to the penance when they pray in common—they
are obviously not concelebrants!
St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite
“The present (65th apostolic) canon reckons it a great sin for a Christian to
enter a synagogue of Jews or of heretics in order to pray. …How much more
is not that Christian violating the law who prays along with the crucifiers of
Christ?”344 This is obviously referring to mere common prayer, since Divine
Liturgy and concelebration are inconceivable in a Jewish synagogue!”
“Whoever prays in company with one that has been excommunicated
from the congregation and prayer of the faithful, even though he should not
pray along with him in church, but in a house, whether he be in holy orders or
a layman, he is to be excommunicated.
”345 The one cut off from common
worship is not acceptable even to private common prayer. Here also this is
not speaking of the Divine Liturgy nor of concelebration, since a layman
cannot concelebrate.
“The present (45th apostolic) canon prescribes that any Bishop, or
Presbyter, or Deacon that shall only join in prayer, and not co-officiate in
divine services, with any heretics is to be suspended,…But if he went so far
as to allow those heretics to perform any service in church as Clergymen, he
is to be deposed.
”346 Here also common prayer is clearly distinguished from
concelebration both as regards the actions of the violator and as regards the
consequences.
In his interpretation of the 11th apostolic canon, St. Nikodemos accepts
the possibility of both meanings: either “the phrase ‘pray in company with’
[is] taken for ‘officiate in conjunction with,
’” or “the phrase ‘pray in common
with’ denotes what it properly signifies, i.e., to pray along with someone
else.
”347
Aristenos
Professor Vlasios Pheidas cites only one phrase of Aristenos (“the one that
prays in common, that is, concelebrates”), by means of which he interprets
the 11th apostolic canon, which clearly refers to the concelebration of one
clergyman with another deposed clergyman. Certainly, Aristenos does not
say that this interpretation applies to all the canons, as is demonstrated by the
following selections, where he clearly extends the canonical prohibition of
common prayer to simple prayer also:
“
…Whoever has entered into a synagogue of Jews or heretics and prayed
with them…But the bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, that has only prayed with
heretics in a house is excommunicated.
”348 Here again concelebration with
Jews, or concelebration in a private house, are inconceivable. Obviously, he
is referring to mere common prayer!
“Let the one that prays together with heretics in a church, or in a house,
be likewise an excommunicate himself as well.
”349 Common prayer “in a
house” cannot be concelebration.
“Whoever admits to the faithful one that has no admittance to a church,
and prays in common with him in houses or in another church, is answerable
to the canons.
”350
“Whoever only prayed in common with heretics, whether presbyter or
deacon, is deposed, but whoever permitted them to perform any service as
ordained clergymen is deposed.
”351 A distinction is made between “only
praying in common” and “permitting them to perform any service as ordained
clergymen.
” As a result by “merely praying in common” the canon means
mere common prayer without priestly action and proscribes
excommunication. If concelebration were meant, deposition would be called
for, since it would fit the description of “permitted them to perform any
service as ordained clergymen is deposed.
”
Blastaris
“It is altogether forbidden for us to pray in common with a heretic or
schismatic.
”352 The word “altogether”
, which is not present in the text of the
canon, was added by the interpreter to cover every meaning of “συνεύχεσθαι”
and to intensify the meaning of the prohibition.
Zonaras
“The canon [64th Apostolic] submits that it is a great sin for a Christian to
enter a synagogue of Jews or heretics for the sake of prayer…A Christian
who prays alongside the murderers of Christ is to be judged as a
transgressor.
”353 Certainly a common Divine Liturgy with Jews is not what is
meant!
“Therefore should one pray in common with an excommunicate… even if
it is not in a church but in a home, he too will be excommunicated.
”
“Neither should any pray together in a house, nor welcome them [the
excommunicates] in another church. But the ones that pray in common with
such men, or that welcome them into churches, are also excommunicates…
The same is stated by the 10th and 11th canons of the Holy Apostles and by
the 33rd canon of the council in Laodicea, that one must not pray in common
with heretics and schismatics.
”354 Here, Zonaras distinguishes between
“praying together in a house” and “welcoming…in a church,
” the one as
being mere common prayer, the other as being an expression of the prayer of
the church community, of the Holy Eucharist. As many, then, as “pray in
common with or welcome” excommunicates or heretics or schismatics “are
themselves excommunicates.
”
The rest of Church Tradition regarding common prayer:
St. Nikephorus the Confessor,
Patriarch of Constantinople
“It is not befitting to enter into such churches [belonging to heretics] at all,
for the aforementioned purposes [namely for prayers and psalmody]… For as
soon as heresy was introduced, the guardian angel thereof has left it,
according to the witness of St. Basil the Great, and such a temple is
henceforth a common house. And it is written,
‘I will not enter into the
congregation of evil-doers,
”355 while the Apostle says,
356 “what agreement
hath the temple of God with idols?’”357
Patriarch Germanos II of
Constantinople (1240)
“For this reason do I adjure all the laity, as many of you as are genuine
children of the Catholic Church, to flee entirely from those priests that have
fallen under the latin subjection and not even to congregate with them in
church, nor to accept a chanced-upon blessing from their hands. For it is
better to pray to God in your homes by yourselves than gather in churches
with the latin-minded.
”358 Let it be noted here that he is refering not to
Papists, but Latin-minded Orthodox clergy.
Patriarch Cyril V of Constantinople
and the Patriarchal Synod
Convened by Him (1749)
“We command and order paternally and spiritually… from henceforth do not
dare at all to commune together with the aforementioned friars and
francopriests and the rest of the Westerners in the sacred Mysteries of our
Church and in the rest of the ecclesiastical rituals, prayers, and ceremonies,
but to wholly preserve… your non-communion from them in all the sacred
rituals and ceremonies. Should, however, after our patriarchal and synodal
chastisement and this paternal and spiritual counsel and advice, anyone of
you dare to seem disobedient and opposed, or should one of the
aforementioned priests dare and be caught praying together with the Latins or
accepting their offerings or celebrating commemorations on their behalf…
such a priest will be submitted to utter revocation of his priesthood.
”359
Council of the Patriarchs of
Constantinople, Alexandria,
Antioch and Jerusalem (1848)
“[The council] rules once again today in council… that [Papism] is a heresy
and its followers are heretics… Likewise the congregations formed by them
are heretical and every spiritual communion of the Orthodox children… with
them is anticanonical, just as the 7th canon of the Third Ecumenical Council
determines.
”360
St. Justin Popovich
“The sacred canon of the Holy Apostles does not specify exactly which
prayer or service is prohibited, but it prohibits all common prayer with
heretics, even private prayer (“συνευξάμενος”). Are not greater and broader
things than these being committed during ecumenistic common prayers?…Is
it perhaps not the case…that blessings are being given by heretical Roman
Catholic bishops and priests, Protestant pastors, and even women?”361
Patriarch Athenagoras of
Constantinople and the Patriarchal
Synod He Convened
“It is a necessity for Orthodox clerical representatives to be as hesitant as
possible in the liturgical gatherings with the heterodox as being antithetical to
the holy canons and dulling the confessional sensitivity of the Orthodox, and
strive to perform, if possible, purely Orthodox services and ceremonies, that
the splendour and majesty of Orthodox worship may thus be presented before
the eyes of the heterodox.
”362
“What further need have we of witnesses?” The Patriarchal Synod says it
all! Neither does it speak of concelebration, nor “interconfessional prayers”
does it accept, but it declares unequivocally that liturgical gatherings with the
heterodox stand in opposition to the holy canons and bear serious pastoral
consequences, and it proscribes the performing of “purely Orthodox services
and ceremonies” with a pastoral-missionary aim. Chiefly, though, the
Patriarchal Synod dissociates common prayers from inter-Church relations.
There can be inter-Christian cooperation without common prayers!
Not even Ecumenical Patriarch
Bartholomew accepts Pheidas’s
novel interpretation
In his doctoral dissertation, referring to the holy canons which forbid
common prayers, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew notes that “The canons
which govern the relations of Orthodox Christians with the heterodox and
those of other religions are unenforceable and must be changed. It is not
possible for the Church to have ordinances prohibiting the entry of the
heterodox into the temples and common prayer with them while at the same
time through her representatives She prays in common with them.
”363 He has
also expressed similar views in an article of his on the subject “The problem
of Oikonomia today” in the journal Kanon (6, 1983). It is totally clear that
when the Ecumenical Patriarch writes,
“through her representatives She prays
in common with them [the heretics]” and, as a result,
“the canons [which
forbid common prayer] are unenforceable and must be changed,
” he is
referring to the mere common prayers and other services which take place
within the framework of the Ecumenical Movement and definitely not to
concelebration. The Patriarch does not accept intercommunion! So, for our
Ecumenical Patriarch, when the canons refer to common prayer, they mean
common prayer and not concelebration!
Further, in his letter to the Holy Community of Mount Athos dated July 3,
1999, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew emphasizes among other things the
following: “With regard to common prayers with the heterodox we would
remind you that even since the year 1952 the Ecumenical Patriarchate…has
been of the opinion that ‘participation of the Orthodox in the pan-Christian
movement must take place according to the following terms: a)…b)…c) ‘It is
a necessity for Orthodox clerical representatives to be as hesitant as possible
in the liturgical gatherings with the heterodox as being antithetical to the holy
canons and dulling the confessional sensitivity of the Orthodox, and strive to
perform, if possible, purely Orthodox services and ceremonies, that the
splendour and majesty of Orthodox worship may thus be presented before the
eyes of the heterodox.
’ Consequently, it unjustified to attribute responsibility
to the Ecumenical Patriarchate for any chance violations of its
recommendation by various clergymen and in fact for the most part by
clergyman belonging to other churches. It must be noted that, as is known,
during the Inter-Orthodox Meeting in Thessaloniki (4.29-5.2.1998) it was
decided, at the initiative of the representation of the Patriarchate…that the
Orthodox Committee Members, who were to participate at the upcoming 8th
General Assembly of the WCC at Harare, would not participate in
ecumenical prayer gatherings, common prayers, worship and other religious
ceremonies during the duration of the Assembly, this constituting a
demonstration of the full force of the consistent line of the above Encyclical
of 1952, which was never revoked, even if, without the consent of the
Ecumenical Patriarchate, it was violated at times, or it was interpreted at
other times in a limited way or as referring to non-participation in worship
only in the narrow sense (Divine Liturgy). As for common prayer with those
of other religions, the Ecumenical Patriarchate considers the canonical
prohibition against such and abstention from such to be self-evident, although
this does not mean that the prohibition against common prayer extends also
to a prohibition against inter-religious dialogue.
”364
The Ecumenical Patriarch clearly concurs that:
1. 2. 3. 4. The Patriarchal Encyclical of 1952 forbids participation not only in
the Divine Liturgy but also in every form of prayer which takes places
within the context of the Ecumenical Movement at “ecumenical
liturgical gatherings, common prayers, worship services and other
religious ceremonies.
”
The decision of the Inter-Orthodox Commission (Thessaloniki, 1998)
to prohibit participation in any type of common prayer (“ecumenical
liturgical gatherings, common prayers, worship services and other
religious ceremonies”) constitutes an application of the prohibition of
the encyclical of Athenagoras of 1952, or, as the Patriarch states
verbatim, it constitutes,
“a demonstration of the full force of the
consistent line of the above Encyclical of 1952.
”
All of these common prayers within the context of the Ecumenical
Movement—and not only in the Divine Liturgy—are forbidden as
being “antithetical to the holy canons and dulling the confessional
sensitivity of the Orthodox.
”
The Patriarchal Encyclical of 1952 applies even today, since it was
never revoked by the Patriarchate, even if some “without the consent
5. 6. 7. 8. of the Ecumenical Patriarchate” violate it at times or wrongly interpret
it as referring only to the Divine Liturgy!
The common prayers that take place are violations of the Patriarchal
encyclical for which the Patriarchate is not responsible since they are
being performed for the most part by clergy of other Churches.
In the canonical prohibition against common prayer, common prayer
with those of other religions is also covered, so the canons do not
merely refer to participation in the Divine Liturgy.
The prohibition against common prayer does not mean that inter-
religious dialogue is also prohibited.
Besides the Ecumenical Patriarch, many contemporary theologians
who have participated in the theological dialogues, some of whom
have made major contributions to the Ecumenical Movement and
have dealt with the issue of common prayer within its framework
(Archbishop Stylianos of Australia, Methodios formerly of Thyateira,
Fr. Theodore Zisis, I. Karmiris, C. Scouteris, Th. Yiangou) do not
share the novel interpretation of Pheidas that common prayer in the
holy canons refers only to the Divine Liturgy.
Finally, in our brief work entitled One Must Not Join in Prayer with
Heretics and Schismatics (Patras, 2008), we presented the views of
tens of clergymen (including the previous Archbishops of Athens), of
professors of Theological Schools, of Mt. Athos, of contemporary
patristic figures, of local synods of Orthodox Churches and of the
Inter-Orthodox Commission, who accept without qualification that the
canonical prohibition against common prayer includes not only
concelebration and participation in the Divine Liturgy, but mere
common prayer with heretics as well.
In conclusion, Professor Pheidas is completely mistaken in his view that
the holy canons which forbid common prayer with heretics relate exclusively
to the Divine Liturgy and “always connect συνεύχεσθαι solely with acts of
concelebration or co-officiation of Orthodox clergy with heretics” (Pheidas,
p. 19) and “consequently, the true meaning of the aforementioned canons
[which forbid common prayer with heretics] refers only to the prohibition of
concelebration of Orthodox clergymen with the heterodox and certainly not
to their participation in every other prayer” (Pheidas, p. 20).
According to the patristic literature, the canonical provisions, the
distinguished interpreters, ecclesiastical literature, contemporary theological
thought, and even according to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew himself,
the canonical prohibition against common prayer does not refer only to the
Divine Liturgy, but rather to any type of ecclesiastical prayer, ceremony, or
service, wherever these may be taking place, even within the context of the
Ecumenical Movement (“ecumenical liturgical gatherings, common prayers,
worship services and other religious ceremonies” according to the
Ecumenical Patriarch).
The Holy Canons as a creation of the fourth century!
The second line of reasoning of the professor has to do with the era of the
composition of the holy canons which forbid common prayer with heretics
and, by extension, with their application as well. According to the professor,
in order for the true meaning of the canon to be understood correctly, there
must be the “consistent relation of the spirit of the canon to specific
ecclesiastical problems of a specific era” and more specifically “to the
circumstances of the fourth century that posed a danger for the unity of the
Church” (Pheidas, p. 15). In fact, refering to the 45th apostolic canon and to
Canons 6, 9, 31, 32, and 33 of Laodicea (fourth century,) he notes,
“the
Church always relativized the bounds of the canonical exactitude of the
above canons in ecclesiastical practice and did not renew their validity
through any subsequent canon” (Pheidas, p.20), implying that this prohibition
no longer has any application, since the conditions threatening Church unity
which existed in the fourth century, when the canons were issued, have since
subsided.
The professor explores the ecclesiastical reality of the fourth century in
great depth and in so doing interprets the strictness with which the apostolic
and subsequent canons deal with contact between Orthodox and heretics in
worship as being unique to that era (Pheidas, p. 15-16, 26-27, 30-31). But are
things really so? Certainly not, since it should not escape us that the strict
prohibition against contact with heretics dates back to the first years of the
apostolic era. The references in the texts of the New Testament are clear and
more absolute than those of the holy canons.
365 So also among the Apostolic
Fathers and subsequently with all the Fathers. What, then, is the difference in
the fourth century? The canons of certain local councils and the patristic texts
of the fourth century, with their validation by ecumenical councils, acquired
heightened validity and most notably came thus to be codified within the
Canon Law of our Church, something which is not the case for earlier
councils (except for the one in Carthage in AD 252) or for earlier Fathers
(except for Ss. Dionysius and Gregory). Thus, the older texts, since they have
not been codified in Canon Law, are not a subject of his study. This,
however, does not mean that they do not exist and that it took until the fourth
century for the church to refuse contact with heretics! Rather, from her
earliest years and not only since the fourth century has the Church extended
the strictest prohibitions regarding heretics, and as soon as her canon law
began to develop, She codified them therein, and they thus acquired
canonical and ecumenical validity.
But also in the subsequent centuries, when “the conditions of the fourth
century which endangered the unity of the Church” (Pheidas, p.15) had
subsided, the Church not only did not rescind these holy canons as being
henceforth excessive, but She observed them and extended to them
ecumenical validity. How else could one interpret their successive validation
without the slightest modification by three ecumenical councils? The canons
forbidding common prayer with heretics have been validated, without any
change or modification, by the first canon of the Fourth Ecumenical Council
(not counting the apostolic ones), the 2nd canon of the Sixth Ecumenical
Council, and the first canon of the Seventh Ecumenical Council, as well as by
the ages-old Church Tradition down to the present day. Is it amazing how this
point also escaped (?) the attention of the professor, so much so that not only
does he nowhere mention the validation of these canons by three ecumenical
councils, but he alleges that the Church “did not renew their validity through
any subsequent canon” (Pheidas, p. 20)!
The Church within the context of her pastoral care and responsibility
certainly has a right and a duty toward to approach certain cases with
economia.
366 In examining the relevant texts of the Fathers of the Church and
of the distinguished canonists, we easily see how willing they are to apply
economia in multifarious ways when a heretic rejects error and wishes to
return to the Church, whereas conversely they are especially sparing even to
the point of total denial regarding the use of economia toward common
prayer with heretics. Indeed, they are much more strict and categorical in the
prohibition against entry of the Orthodox into temples of heretics for
common prayer with them, whereas some are more permissive in allowing by
economia for heretics to be present in Orthodox worship, when they come
with reverence and a disposition toward acquainting themselves with it.
Never under any circumstances, however, is the active participation of
heretics—especially their leaders—permitted in liturgical practice. It must be
made clear that rare exceptions in the life of the Church cannot be used as an
alibi for the amnestying of contemporary practices which have no relation to
diachronic ecclesiastical conduct and practice.
Mr. Pheidas dedicates a major portion of his study (pp. 21-26) to “the
holy canons of the Council of Carthage (419) regarding the dialogue with the
Donatists, which express the diachronic spirit of the Orthodox canonical
tradition concerning all dialogue with the heterodox” (Pheidas, p. 22). And
yet, a careful examination of these canons does not lead to the justification of
Professor’s views—rather the contrary! Let us explain:
Professor Pheidas’s article is concerned with “the question of common
prayer with the heterodox according to the holy canons.
” The broader issue of
theological dialogues and inter-Christian relations—however related they
may seem to the issue of common prayer—requires its own study. It is not
possible to examine it parenthetically and indirectly!
The article mentions five canons of the Council at Carthage (out of the
eighteen which mention the Donatists). Truly the Church is pained and very
much concerned for repentance and proffers ecclesiastical economia for their
return—who doubts this or who disagrees? In these canons the procedure
which Orthodox shepherds ought to follow in dialogue with them is described
in great detail. The critical point to understand at the outset, however, is that
nowhere in the canons is it implied in the slightest that there should be
common liturgical gatherings, common prayer, or any other common
religious ceremony with those with whom we find ourselves in dialogue,
neither certainly are Orthodox shepherds and faithful encouraged to attend
gatherings for “interconfessional prayer” or to have “participation in common
prayer for unity or in liturgical events, held by the Churches that are carrying
out an official theological dialogue, for the support or even for the
strengthening of the objectives thereof” (Pheidas, p. 27).
As a result, following Mr. Pheidas who relates the above holy canons to
the question of common prayer, if we accept that “the canons of the Council
of Carthage (419) regarding dialogue with the Donatists,…express the
diachronic spirit of the Orthodox canonical tradition regarding all theological
dialogue with the heterodox” (Pheidas, p 22), we wonder how does it follow
that the holy canons “do not only permit, but even encourage common prayer
unto the reinforcing of their expressed disposition toward constructive
theological dialogue for the unity of the Church body” (Pheidas, p. 28), or
whence does it follow that “in diachronic ecclesiastical practice…every
initiative of dialogue toward the restoration of the unity of the Church…
contained as a self-evident component the common prayers between
representatives of the dialoguing Churches”?
The following questions are addressed to Mr. Pheidas, who is the most
qualified in matters of Church history: In the vast number of dialogues in
which the Church has engaged in her bimillenary lifetime—some having
success and others failing—is there a historical precedent which would
justify the things taking place today within the Ecumenical Movement with
relation to common prayers, e.g. the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity? At
what other time have Orthodox and heretics collaborated for the organization
of “interconfessional prayer”
, as has occurred within the WCC? At what
other time within Church history has the leader of a heresy taken an active
role in the most formal, if I may be allowed the expression, Orthodox Divine
Liturgy, being censed as a presiding canonical bishop, reciting the Lord’s
Prayer on behalf of the Orthodox faithful, receiving and giving the Kiss of
Peace—actions which are only permissible for concelebrating hierarchs and
priests—and finally, before the official bema of the Patriarchal temple
preaching papal primacy? When has a leader of a heresy or schism been
hymned as a canonical bishop and indeed “venerable shepherd and primate,
”
with the heresy or schism over which he presides being called a “venerable
Church”?367 Is there such a precedent? Does this not constitute a
provocation?
In the final analysis, if “in diachronic ecclesiastical practice…every
initiative of dialogue toward the restoration of the unity of the Church…
contained as a self-evident component the common prayers between
representatives of the dialoguing Churches,
” why does Mr. Pheidas’s study
not present us with one or two historical pieces of evidence in support of such
a claim from each period of Church history? It would have been important to
show us cases of the “common prayer between representatives of the
dialoguing Churches” within the context of dialogues for ecclesiastical unity
in the era of the Gnostics (2nd and 3rd c.), the Arian controversy (4th c.), the
Christological heresies (5th, 6th, 7th c.), iconoclasm, the efforts toward unity
with the West (11th-15th c.), or the dialogues with the Protestants (16th-17th
c.). We especially ask Mr. Pheidas to acquaint us with hymns like the
aforementioned, if any have been preserved within our hymnography! Could
perhaps the absence of any incidents comparable to the contemporary ones in
the history of the Church instead confirm the inexactness of the professor’s
assertion? At the same time, should it not make us ponder on how and where
we are headed?
Roman Catholics and Protestants have not been characterized
as heretics?
According to Mr. Pheidas,
“Roman Catholics, Old Catholics, Anglicans, and
Protestants have not been condemned by the Orthodox Church, by means of
an official ecclesiastical act, as heretics…and for this reason the
characterisation of ‘heretic’ attributed to them by some is unfounded since
the Church may only characterize…as heretics or schismatics through formal
acts” (Pheidas, p. 31).
It is obvious that the professor himself does not totally accept the
aforementioned position that Roman Catholics and Protestant have not been
condemned as heretics, since in that case there would be no need for the rest
of the argumentation of the study, because that reason alone would be more
than sufficient for the canons in question which prohibit common prayer with
heretics to not apply in the case of Roman Catholics and Protestants! Let us
here point out that even if the Papists were merely schismatics, common
prayer with them would still be forbidden according to the canons!
Nevertheless, the critical question is, what does the phrase “the Church
characterizes” mean, or, how does the Church make judgements regarding
heresies?
Certainly the supreme—though not exclusive—authority through which
the Orthodox Church expresses herself is the ecumenical council. When,
however, it is not possible for an ecumenical council to be convened, or when
the Church does not judge it advisable to convoke one, the Church judges and
characterizes a teaching as heretical through local councils. Even the
unanimous opinion of the Fathers (consensus patrum) itself expresses the
unerring mindset of the Church. The 15th canon of the First-Second Council
refers with total clarity to “some heresy condemned by the holy councils or
Fathers.
” There are many examples from the life and tradition of the Church
which affirm the above:
The Gnostics were characterized as heretics without the convocation of an
ecumenical council.
The great heresiarchs Arius, Macedonius, Nestorius, and the iconoclasts
were recognized as heretics and cut off from the ecclesiastical community
before the convocation of the ecumenical council that condemned them
definitely.
The opponents of Hesychasm were condemned as heretics by local
councils in Constantinople. Ethnophyletism was condemned as heresy by a
local synod of the Church of Constantinople.
What is the case, then, with Papism?
Certainly, the Church, for reasons She judged, did not call together an
ecumenical council in order to pronounce an express condemnation, as
happened with other heretics. Nevertheless, to the diachronic conscience of
the Church, Papism is a heresy. Many distinguished theologians, and most
importantly, the totality of the Saints of the Orthodox Church who dealt with
Papism unanimously concur that the Roman Catholic “church” is heretical.
There is not one Saint of our Church—no! Not even one Saint!—who
contends that Papism is not a heresy!
Furthermore, there exists a plethora of local councils—of the stature of
those convened over the Hesychastic Controversy and Ethnophyletism—
which have condemned Papal errors as heresies. Also in her liturgical texts
the Orthodox Church refers to Papism as heresy (see the Synodikon of
Orthodoxy).
Finally, one of the errors of Papism, the Filioque, stands in opposition to
the Definition of the Second Ecumenical Council and the decision of the
Third Ecumenical Council and was expressly condemned by the Council of
Constantinople of 879, in which also participated representatives of the Pope
and of all the Patriarchs and the decisions of which have come to be
unanimously accepted by its participants and by the plēroma of the Church.
In a notable publication of the Holy Monastery of Gregoriou,
“The
struggles of monastics for Orthodoxy” (pp. 205-234), are posited the views of
many saints and teachers of our Church (more than 40 persons) that declared
the papal innovations heretical. Indeed, certain of these also gave their blood
for the Orthodox Faith. Additionally, the theologian P. Simatis cites many
local councils of our Orthodox Church after the Schism (besides the
Ecumenical ones) which condemn the teachings of Papism as heretical.
368
The Conciliar decision of the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria,
Antioch and Jerusalem of 1848 is indicative: “Arianism was once one of
these heresies that were spread to a large portion of the world, for reasons
which the Lord knows. Such today is also Papism… [The Filioque] is a
heresy and those who believe it are heretics… For this reason also the one,
Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, following in the footsteps of the holy
Fathers, eastern and western, declared both long ago in the days of our
Fathers and rules once again today in council… that it is a heresy and its
followers are heretics… Likewise, the congregations formed by them are
heretical and every spiritual communion of the Orthodox children… with
them is anticanonical, just as the 7th canon of the Third Ecumenical Council
determines”
.
369 The Council of Constantinople in 1895 also speaks along
these lines: “There are substantial differences which concern the God-given
dogmas of our faith and the God-established canonical regiment of the
administration of the Churches… The Papist Church… not only refuses to
return to the canons and the terms of ecumenical councils, but at the end of
the 19th century broadened the existing chasm, officially proclaiming
infallibility… The current Roman Church is a church of innovations, of
adulteration of the writings of the Fathers, of misinterpretation of Scripture
and the terms of the ecumenical councils. Therefore it was reasonably and
justly denounced and is still denounced, as long as it remains in its
delusion.
”370
Consequently, if anyone—whoever he may be—does not accept the
explicit and fixed teaching of our Church, the consonant opinion of Her
Councils and of our Saints, that Papism is a heresy, this is a matter of his own
personal choice and responsibility.
Let us ask ourselves, then, as ones bearing the responsibility of shepherds
and teachers of the people of God: when all the saints and many councils of
one accord have expressly decided, how can we today with lightness of heart
dogmatize assuredly that “the characterisation of ‘heretic’ attributed to them
by some is unfounded”? Could then perhaps ethnophyletism also not be a
heresy, or are the views of Barlaam and Akindynos perhaps not heretical?
Why two measures and two weights? Or are we to judge as we see fit that
some of the local councils and the unanimously expressed opinions of the
saints express the Church and others do not? Do we know better than all the
saints and the councils that decided? Does not such an assertion approach the
bounds of blasphemy?
Furthermore, what is to occur if this syllogism regarding Papism is
extended to other heresies, e.g. to Jehovah’s Witnesses, to the Mormons,
Pentecostals, televangelists, since they “have not been condemned by the
Orthodox Church, by means of an official ecclesiastical act, as heretics”?
In studying the relevant texts we see the following paradox: in the past
the whole Orthodox Tradition, practically unanimously, characterized the
Roman Catholics as heretics (the exceptions are very few, mainly in the first
centuries after the Schism, and these not by major theologians). In the last
decades, by contrast, we see an ever greater number of theologians that serve
the Ecumenical Movement totally denying the centuries-long Tradition of
Orthodoxy, asserting with typical insistence that Roman Catholics are not
heretics! This strong contradiction raises a reasonable question: how is it
possible for Orthodox theologians to express themselves in radical opposition
to their own ecclesiastical tradition? What has happened? Why do we see
such unanimity in the denial of Church Tradition within the ecumenistic
circles of Orthodox theologians on this critical matter?
This reasonable question might find its answer in the dissertation of Mr.
A. Bletsis, professor at the University of Munich, who, at the scientific
symposium which the Theological School of Thessaloniki organized on the
topic “Theological Dialogue between the Orthodox Church and the Roman
Catholic Church (Thessaloniki 5.20.2009)”
, referred to meetings that
preceded the official Theological Dialogue in 1980, which “not only prepared
the Theological Dialogue, but could be considered in many ways exemplary
for the resolution of outstanding theological matters. The solutions that have
been recommended [according to the professor] even today could constitute
the way forward, the real way forward in the journey of the Churches in the
quest for unity.
” And Professor Bletsis continues with the following
revelation: “In 1976 in one of the symposia of Pro Oriente at the University
of Graz, professor of Dogmatics [and future Pope] Joseph Ratzinger put
forward a proposal for the solution of the much-disputed matter of the
jurisdiction of Rome and the union of the Churches, Catholic and Orthodox.
Their unity [said Ratzinger] could ‘be achieved upon the basis that the East
would cease combatting the Western developments of the second millennium
as heretical and would recognize the Catholic Church in its current form as
being lawful and correct from the perspective of faith, while in return the
West would recognize the East as lawful and correct in faith in the form
which it has maintained throughout its history’”! Ratzinger is totally clear:
“the East would cease combatting the Western developments of the second
millennium as heretical”!
In other words, according to the proposal of then Professor J. Ratzinger
and subsequently Pope Benedict XVI, the Orthodox theologians serving in
the dialogues ought not to conform their own theological reasoning and their
behavior to the ecclesiastical tradition of Orthodoxy, but rather, they should
conform our tradition to the aims which have been put forward by an
agreement with the Pope! If the Orthodox want to serve the dialogue, they
must not, according to the Pope, characterize as heretical the novel dogmas of
Papism, but they must rather interpret their own ecclesiastical tradition in
such a way as not to be in conflict with Papism! In light of this, is it a very
“bad thought” to think that the Pope appears to be determining the
theological discourse of certain Orthodox theologians? Or in any case (to put
it more elegantly), that the theological discourse of certain—but certainly not
all—Orthodox is a product of… agreement with the Pope?
For some, unfortunately, the aim today is not to conform their behavior to
our ecclesiastical tradition, but to cut and stitch” our tradition in accordance
with the aims which they have set… And when they find themselves at odds
with the patristic teaching of the last ten centuries since the Schism—which
on the whole is opposed to the Papal dogmas—they seek to invalidate it with
the very theological argument that it is…polemical, whereas we nowadays
are full of…love!
Contempt for Ecclesiastical Tradition or Ecumenical
Movement?
In the effort to justify uncanonical common prayers, the professor asserts that
they are “an inescapable result of the official decision of the Orthodox
Church to participate through representatives…in the governing bodies and
activities of the contemporary Ecumenical Movement for the unity of
Christians” (Pheidas p.11).
Thus a (false) dilemma is posited: contempt for ecclesiastical tradition, or
Ecumenical Movement? But are things really so? Definitely not! The
professor’s view is self-contradictory since the history of the Church and
present-day reality both confirm that there can be inter-Christian dialogue
without common prayers with total respect for our Church Tradition:
The Church always dialogued with schismatics and heretics throughout
her history and even with those of other religions, with many of whom the
hope for union was realized. And while this always required warm and
intense prayer, it was nonetheless strictly forbidden for there to be even the
slightest form of common prayer!
As for it being beneficial and indeed necessary for inter-Christian
relations to be combined with respect for Church Tradition, let us hear from
one experienced in theological dialogues, Protopresbyter of the Ecumenical
Throne Fr. Theodore Zisis, who puts forth the only mode of conduct
acceptable from the point of view of ecclesiastical order: “There is another
means of dialogue and approach to the heterodox, without intermingling,
common prayers, and concelebrations: the mere bodily presence, by
economia, without any prayerful or liturgical participation… Even during the
opening of the theological discussions during the meeting (at Ferrara), the
Latins and the Orthodox prayed separately, a practice which is observed up to
our day in some theological dialogues.
”371
Relevant is also the announcement (dated 4.9/22.1980) of the Holy
Extraordinary Double Synaxis of the Holy Community of Mt. Athos
“Regarding the Dialogue of the Orthodox and Roman Catholics,
” wherein,
among other things, the Holy Community of Mt. Athos asked that
“theological dialogue be in no wise accompanied by common prayers,
participation in liturgical and prayer gatherings of any kind and other actions
which are likely to give the impression that our Orthodox Church accepts the
Roman Catholics as a full Church and the Pope as canonical Bishop of Rome.
These actions lead into error both the Orthodox plēroma and Roman
Catholics, giving to [the latter] an erroneous impression as to how Orthodoxy
conceives of them…
”372
Let us also not forget that until very recently a theological dialogue was
taking place with the non-Chalcedonian Churches. And yet, never was the
issue of common prayer with them raised, since these churches respect
ecclesiastical order regarding this point! The conformity of the participants
with canonical tradition did nothing to hinder this dialogue from advancing.
For what reason, then, should this practice not be applied in our contacts with
the Roman Catholics or Protestants?
In the same spirit as the proposal of Fr. Theodore Zisis is the
aforementioned Encyclical of January 31, 1952, by the Synod gathered under
Patriarch Athenagoras to the Primates of the Orthodox Churches, which
discourages the representatives of the Autocephalous Churches who
participate in theological dialogues from engaging in common prayers.
“The Ecumenical Patriarchate considers the canonical prohibition [of
common prayer with those of other religions] and abstention from such to be
self-evident, although this does not mean that the prohibition against common
prayer extends also to a prohibition against inter-religious dialogue,
”
emphasizes present-day Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. According to
the Ecumenical Patriarch there can be dialogue and cooperation without
common prayer!
In contrast, the logic of Mr. Pheidas regarding an inseparable link
between inter-Christian dialogue and common prayers is in reality to the
detriment of the Ecumenical Movement itself, since any effort which leads to
the scorning of Church Tradition cannot be accepted by any Orthodox! A
dialogue founded upon the violation of the holy canons cannot have the
blessing of God, despite the good intention of those entangled in it! In reality,
to what sort of Orthodox witness are they contributing who participate in a
process where the decisions of the ecumenical councils and the centuries-
long tradition and life of Orthodoxy are ignored? Such a dialogue is a failure
from the outset and cannot be accepted by the conscience of the Church!
“We cause only harm and do not help the dialogue at all,
” unambiguously
stated Archbishop Stylianos of Australia (co-President of the Official
Theological Dialogue with the Roman Catholics for a period of twenty
years), referring to certain common prayers which he characterizes as “tragic
mistakes” which have serious consequences: “unfortunately [these mistakes]
create much commotion, much harm, without producing any profit at all for
us. Thus we give the impression that we are hastening to achieve
intercommunio, and sacramental communion with the heterodox… we cause
only harm and do not help the dialogue at all.
”373
Finally, conformity with the holy canons and the refusal by the Orthodox
representatives to participate in a common Divine Liturgy (intercommunio,
Liturgy of Lima)—despite the insistence of the heterodox—in no way
hindered, even to the slightest degree, the dialogue with the heterodox. Why
should the same stance not be maintained for every form of common prayer?
Common prayers with heretics and the people of God
The professor himself confesses that the strictness regarding contact with
heretics in worship in the fourth century had only to do with pastoral reasons
of the preservation of the Orthodox mindset of the faithful. Of course, he
maintains that the dangers of that era have subsided and implies that today
there is no reason for the prohibition against common prayer with heretics
within the context of the Ecumenical Movement.
Certainly, the dangers of the fourth century do not exist today. Instead,
things are much more serious and much more dangerous. There does not
exist, as in the past, the danger of departure from the Orthodox Church to join
the Roman Catholic, but rather something more serious: the dissolution of the
Orthodox sensitivity. Today, in the era of secularization, there exists an
increasing indifference toward faith, which in the end comes to mean an
indifference for the very message of the Gospel. The motto of the New Age is
much more dangerous than any heresy of the past: “All roads lead to God. No
one has a right to exclusivity. All religions are the same and no religion can
claim that it expresses the whole truth. Pieces of the truth are everywhere. It
does not matter what each one believes.
” It is obvious that this conception
undermines the essence of the Church and dissolves the Orthodox ethos of
the faithful, since it constitutes a total denial of the Gospel, since it leads to
the denial of the unique Savior and Redeemer Jesus Christ. Surely, I wish to
believe, no Orthodox shepherd subscribes to the “branch theory” and more
generally to the teaching of the New Age, even if certain statements allow for
other readings (e.g. about the two lungs of Christianity!).
Nevertheless, there is a serious problem when Orthodox shepherds, and
indeed the foremost among them, give the impression to the common people
that the truth of the faith should not be put first, that dogma does not bear
much importance, that it suffices for us to be “loving.
” Woe, when love and
exactitude in faith are set at odds!
This certainly is no longer stated plainly (fortunately the unfortunate (?)
statements of Athenagoras have not been reiterated), but the faithful, who
sadly know little about their faith, when they see the leaders of heresies
present and actively participating in Orthodox worship and Orthodox bishops
praying in common very often with heretics dressed in vestments (the people
consider even the episcopal mantle as a liturgical vestment), the message they
receive is that it does not matter what we believe, differences in faith do not
matter, since we are all the same, we can all stand together before God
praying in common. The damage done is obvious. Afterward we can give as
many sermons as we wish on the uniqueness of Orthodoxy and the value of
the true faith, etc. The conscience of our people has been corrupted! And
thence we have arrived—to use an example from my own city—to the point
where a theologian-professor and self-proclaimed champion of inter-
Christian dialogue does not see the slightest ecclesiological problem if some
Orthodox systematically, every Sunday, attend and chant at the Roman
Catholic Church of Patras! Is this not relativization of the faith, the total
dulling of Orthodox sensitivity, the total destruction of our ecclesiological
reflexes? Truly the height of tragedy and confusion—and in the remarks of a
theologian at that! Are the foremost shepherds of our Church not responsible
for this sorry state, they that pray with the heterodox on every occasion
opportune or inopportune?
Unless, of course, all these common prayers are taking place so as to
purposely bring about and form such an ethos among our faithful, such that
every resistance to the plans of some may be wiped out! Perhaps, in other
words, for some their only concern is the realization of a “union of the
Churches” in any form, at any cost. And as the only way forward, they chose
the theory and methodology which, according to the Metropolitan of Tyroloe
Panteleimon, was “put forth by certain Roman Catholic participants” in the
Second Vatican Council, that “union will be realized gradually, not through
ecclesiastical-theological negotiations, in three stages: 1) friendship and
psychological preparation, 2) partial sacramental communion [author’s note:
this is accomplished through common prayers], and 3) full sacramental
communion.
”374 Could it be that the disregarding of the canonical order of
our Church is systematically leading us there and this is simply not being
stated?

Very Reverend Father,
I send to You my commentary on the article of Professor Vlasios Pheidas
with the title “The Issue of Common Prayer with the Heterodox According to
the Holy Canons” (Episkepsis, issue 699/4.30.2009, pp. 11-33), which You
cited in a recent text of Yours.
My text was also sent to the offices of Episkepsis, but will likely not
enjoy publication within its pages. Recognizing Your high rank within the
Inter-Orthodox Center of Chambesy, I humbly ask, within the bounds of
Your power, that You intervene on behalf of its publication.
I believe You will agree with me that the publication of another, differing
approach to critical matters regarding our tradition and inter-Christian
relations would be beneficial in many ways. Unfortunately intra-Orthodox
dialogue over matters of inter-Christian dialogue is severely limited to the
realm of “professionals” (according to Professor Bletsis), while the plēroma
of our Church—even the clergy and theologians—remains altogether
excluded from participation. We are now experiencing the results of such a
practice, and they are becoming all the more painful for our ecclesiastical
conscience and life.

Beloved Brother in Christ,
Upon my return from Constantinople this afternoon, I found your note
and, attached, the text related to common prayer. Thank you. I will study it
with the requisite attention, and will also intervene wherever necessary
toward the end of seeing your essay published in the journal Episkepsis.
Dialogue is always beneficial.
With love in the Lord,

Fr. George, bless,
I am following up on my message of 7.7.09 in reference to the
commentary on the article of Professor Vl. Pheidas on common prayer. I
comprehend Your increased obligations, but I am so bold, since in following
church news I see that You spare no time or effort in answering news releases
regarding contemporary Church issues, and in fact You are the only doing so
within the Church of Constantinople. In one such news release of Yours You
made use of the professor’s findings, completely accepting his conclusions.
Additionally, I dare to bother You since I believe that the issue of
common prayers with the heterodox, irrespective of the personal approach of
any of us, is objectively of great importance for the conscience of the Church,
since it concerns the hearts of the faithful, even clergy (and hierarchs!) not
only in the Church of Greece, but in all of Orthodoxy. The feature in
Episkepsis proves as much.
Unfortunately, until today, whereas the canonical tradition of the Church
is systematically being ignored on this matter by certain of the Orthodox
serving within the Ecumenical Movement, there has not been any effort to
justify this behavior, only superficial judgements such as,
“Those canons are
old and do not apply today!” For this reason, I consider the publication of the
article by Vl. Pheidas significant, as a stepping-off point for a fruitful intra-
Orthodox dialogue. And I believe that as many as have spoken up over this
issue until today should take a stand, while Episkepsis is ethically unjustified
in excluding the documented counter-argument.
Certainly, I am totally aware that I am not “schooled in theology”
, such as
to “settle accounts”375 with my esteemed professor. Νevertheless,
“we must
examine not who is the speaker but what is the thing spoken,
” as the ancient
saying goes. And the “thing spoken” in this case, independent of my own
particular faults, does not fall short regarding the faith and teaching of our
Church. This certainty is founded on the fact of my total agreement as to the
interpretation of the relevant canons with that of the Ecumenical Patriarch, as
is documented in his letter to the Holy Community of Mt. Athos dated 3 July
1999, as well as by the reception my views have enjoyed among several
hierarchs (including a Metropolitan of the Ecumenical Throne) and
distinguished professors of theological schools.
Please be assured that the commentary on the article of Professor Pheidas
aims at nothing other than the provocation of dialogue and exchange of
opinions and respect for the established teaching of our Church on this
critical matter.
Hoping that I am not becoming especially burdensome (besides, it’s
Your…
“fault”
, since I first learned of the professor’s publication by reading
an article of Yours), I remain,
With love in Christ,
Fr. Anastasios Gotsopoulos

GENEVA, 27 AUGUST 2009
Beloved brother in Christ and concelebrant,
Thank you for your electronic letter of the 25th instant. As I promised in
my previous letter, I spoke to those in charge at the Orthodox Center in
Geneva in regard to the publication of your treatise in the journal Episkepsis,
and I sent a copy of it to Professor Pheidas. The publication of it now
depends upon the discernment and decision of those responsible in
Chambesy. At one time I had a role, a say, and influence at the Orthodox
Center, but for some time now I have ceased to have these! The best thing for
you going forward is to come into direct contact with His Eminence, the
Director of the Orthodox Center, who is responsible for the publication of the
Journal, or also with Mr. Pheidas, since he was your professor.
Allow me, however, to briefly comment on one or two points from your
letter.
You are poorly informed, brother, that I am “the only one” within the
Church of Constantinople that comments upon current Church events. I do
not know to which magazines and journals you have access, but I assure you
that there is an entire host of officials of the Ecumenical Throne that engage
in commentary on Church developments.
There are not, as you say,
“certain of the Orthodox serving in the
Ecumenical Movement”
. There are Orthodox, clergy and laity, who serve
their Churches, who by conciliar or even unanimous (this I underline) pan-
Orthodox decisions participate in this movement, and who in the names of
their Churches give, not without obstacles, a witness to Christ and Orthodoxy
within the contexts of various inter-Christian Organizations.
As for the canonical tradition of the Church regarding common prayer
being “systematically ignored” on the part of the “ecumenists,
” I think that
they are not ignoring it: there are simply multiple interpretations as regards
the letter and spirit of the relevant canons. This is demonstrated, in any case,
by your treatment of the topic and by the study of Mr. Pheidas and by the
writings of many other well-known professors and theologians (not only
within the country of Greece). You will ask me: at the end of the day, is
common prayer permitted or not? My response (and the response of many
Orthodox across the world) is clear: as long is there is no concelebration and
participation in the Mysteries, the supplication for the help of God during the
opening of an inter-Christian meeting or of some ceremony which aims
toward the restoration, God willing, of Christian unity which the Lord wants,
is something very natural, if not required.
Here’s a question for you, brother: Why such selective use of the holy
canons? In our daily lives do we observe all the canons according to the
letter? Since the holy canons forbid transactions, fellow-traveling, or residing
with heretics, do the faithful to whom you are referring (who, as you say,
have a problem of conscience with the matter of common prayer) first verify
whether their grocer, their roommate, or the person in the next seat on an
airplane is an Orthodox faithful and not heterodox or of another religion? Do
all the faithful of your parish, in whose service the Lord has placed you,
consciously belong to the sheepfold of the Good Shepherd? Do they all
observe the Gospel teachings and the traditions of the Church? Do they all
love one another? In their daily lives, do they apply all of the holy canons to
the letter? Why then this Manichaeism? Why this selective use of the canons?
And finally, today in Orthodoxy has economia ceased to apply, that wise
measure which our Fathers and leaders in the faith established untold years
ago?
Allow me, brother, to observe regarding us clergymen, bishops and
presbyters: rather than dealing with the “stumblings” of “Orthodox
ecumenists” or with the faith of the heterodox, would it not be better, for the
good of the Church, to deal first with what the contemporary Modern Greek
believes today, and whether and how he applies the holy canons and
traditions of the Church in his everyday life?
Do not misunderstand me. I do not mean those few who attend our
usually low-capacity holy temples, and who give the impression that our
churches are overflowing! I mean that mass of the people of Orthodox
Greece, about whom we boast they comprise the overwhelming (95%)
majority of the country. I mean those that declare themselves members of the
Church on the one hand, but have transformed Orthodoxy into an ideology
and political identity; those who have transformed the mysteries into
“folklore” and “secular events” (I saw years ago an invitation to a baptism, in
which the parents invited friends and acquaintances to come together—would
you believe!—to the “striptease” of their daughter!!), where the “liturgists”
are no longer the priests performing the mystery but rather the videographers!
I mean those who receive the Holy Fire with the dignities of a “Head of
State,
” but once they hear “Come receive the Light” and “Christ is Risen,
”
“they melt as wax before the fire,
” leaving behind the liturgists and chanters
alone to perform the Paschal Liturgy which is itself the archetype of every
Orthodox Eucharistic Gathering. We should have these truly “heretical” and
un-Orthodox tendencies and behaviors of our faithful as our main concern
and not what the heretics of the West believe and how the “Orthodox
Ecumenists” conduct themselves. When we have solved the substantial
pastoral problems of our Church (and these are very many), maybe then we
will find some time to deal with what is happening in the outside world.
Our beloved Orthodoxy, brother, is endangered neither by Papism, nor by
Protestantism, nor by the so-called “pan-heresy of Ecumenism.
” It is
endangered by us ourselves, by the worldly spirit which has taken root in our
communities “while we were sleeping”!376

PATRAS 9.11.2009
To the Very Reverend
Fr. George Tsetsis
Grand Protopresbyter of the Ecumenical Patriarchate
Geneva
Very Reverend Fr. George,
I received Your electronic message dated 8.27.09 and I greatly thank You
for Your intervention with Episkepsis. I ask Your forgiveness for the delay in
my response, which owes itself to my several days’ stay on Mt. Athos.
In Your first letter, on 7.10.09, You conveyed to me Your conviction that
“dialogue is always beneficial” and I had truly rejoiced, hoping for a
substantial laying out of perspectives over the critical matter of common
prayers, which the Ecumenical Patriarchate put forth by means of Episkepsis.
In Your second letter dated 8.27.09, however, I discern that You avoid
discussing the matter of common prayers in substance. To be honest, on the
one hand I felt joy thinking that, if my arguments and conclusions in the
matter of common prayer were theologically lacking, You would have
pointed it out to me, since elsewhere You honored me with critique, going to
the trouble to correct me regarding highly important issues with my letter.
Truly, I would have expected some response to the questions which I asked. I
understand, however, the difficult situation in which You find Yourself and
the real impossibility of theologically justifying common prayers and so, I
empathise with You.
Once I have informed You that as of 7.7.09 I have sent to Professor
Pheidas my commentary on his article without having received any response
on his behalf, allow me some observations on Your letter, since You touched
upon certain critical matters.
“Pan-Orthodox Decision”? Certainly not!
With great emphasis, Fr. George, You call upon “conciliar or even
unanimous (this I underline) pan-Orthodox decisions” as an alibi for ignoring
patristic and canonical tradition on the matter of common prayer. Recently,
the Ecumenical Patriarch also spoke following the same logic.
Nevertheless,
• Which “conciliar or pan-Orthodox decision” revoked the 16 holy
canons (of holy Fathers, local and ecumenical councils) which
prohibit common prayers?
• Which “conciliar or pan-Orthodox decision” decreed that henceforth
common prayers are allowed and that they no longer constitute a
canonical violation?
• Which “conciliar or pan-Orthodox decision” approved of the
composition of a regulation for “confessional” or “interconfessional”
common prayer at the meetings of the WCC?
• Which “conciliar or pan-Orthodox decision” obligated the Ecumenical
Patriarch to give and receive the liturgical kiss with the Pope during
the Holy Eucharist?
• Which “conciliar or pan-Orthodox decision” decided that the Pope
who remains in heresy should be hymned as “venerable shepherd and
Primate” and indeed within the Patriarchal Temple?
• Which “conciliar or pan-Orthodox decision” allowed heresy to be
hymned by the First-Throned Church of Constantinople as an “august
Church, Seat of Peter”?
• Which “conciliar or pan-Orthodox decision” gave authority to the
Ecumenical Patriarch to offer the Holy Chalice to the Uniate
Archbishop of Athens? Have we now forgotten the unanimous Pan-
Orthodox Decisions which have expressly condemned the Unia?
And these questions have no end nor response…
At last, Fr. George, let go that old chestnut of pan-Orthodox decisions!
Never did any pan-Orthodox council revoke the holy canons validated by
three ecumenical councils nor give anyone the right to disregard ecclesiastical
tradition and order. If this were ever to occur, then whichever council were to
do this—even if it be “pan-Orthodox”
—would be self-annulled and become a
“Sanhedrin of the lawless” and a “congregation of evildoers.
” Besides, the
“ecumenicality” or “robberhood” of a council is not determined by the
number and representation of the participants, but foremost by its decisions!
But it must not escape us that there are recent important Patriarchal and
inter-Orthodox decisions condemning common prayers as being
ecclesiologically impermissible and uncanonical (cf. Patriarchal Encyclical of
1952, Inter-Orthodox Meeting of Thessaloniki in 1998, the Patriarchal Letter
to the Holy Community of Mt. Athos dated 7.3.1999, et alia).
A New-Age Approach: Everyone is
Right After All!
It made an impression on me, as I have said, that You make no reference to
the essence of the issue of common prayer. Your reference to common prayer
is confined only to Your assertion that,
“there are simply multiple
interpretations as regards the letter and spirit of the relevant canons. This is
demonstrated, in any case, by Your treatment of the topic and by the study of
Mr. Pheidas and by the writings of many other well-known professors and
theologians.
” In other words, You assert that both perspectives, that of
Professor Pheidas and my own, can be accepted as correct, despite being
radically opposed! The concept upon which Your view is based reminds me
of the story about the folk hero of our shadow puppetry, who was telling two
parties with diametrically opposed views that both were right. When a third
man came along and said to him that this was illogical since only one could
be right, Karagiozis left him speechless, saying,
“You are right as well!”
But is that a responsible theological approach to this serious question?
Unfortunately in our case (leaving behind the theatre) I fear that such a
relativization of patristic teaching is catastrophic, since it clearly steers
toward a New-Age approach, according to which “truth is what each believes
to be truth”! Or, to use the words of Cardinal Kasper,
“unity in diversity”
even in matters of faith! Certainly these are novel things and far removed
from our Orthodox Tradition.
“My Response” or The Response of
Church Tradition?
Continuing with Your reference to the issue of common prayer, You write:
“You will ask me: at the end of the day, is common prayer permitted or not?
My response (and the response of many Orthodox across the world) is clear:
as long is there is no concelebration and participation in the Mysteries,
[common prayer] is something very natural, if not required.
” Forgive me, but
I would have expected a different introduction to Your response, since the
issue at hand is not “My response (and the response of many Orthodox across
the world)” but rather the response of ages-old Church Tradition! It is
obvious that in the latter case the answer to the question “You will ask me: at
the end of the day, is common prayer permitted or not?” will be totally
different from the one which You gave! Because You know that Your
response is not in accordance with the teaching of our Church as it has been
expressed through her councils, her saints, and her teachers!
Dearth of Arguments (a)
You speak in your letter of a “grocer”
,
“fellow passenger on a plane”
, etc.
Oversimplification is very easy, but not convincing. I would say that it
demonstrates a dearth of theological arguments in the attempt to justify
common prayers. Let us be totally honest, Father: is it possible to equate
transaction with a grocer, or an airplane trip, with all the impermissible things
that took place during the Thronal Feast of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in
2007? Can a precedent be found within the bimillenary history of the Church
of a liturgical kiss being given during the Eucharist to a recognized heretic
who remains in heresy? Has it ever occurred before that the leader of a heresy
recited, in the name of the Orthodox faithful, the Lord’s prayer during the
Eucharist? Is it possible for one remaining in heresy to be hymned as
“venerable Shepherd and Primate” and his heresy as “august Church”? Even
an Archbishop of the Ecumenical Throne with many years of service in the
Ecumenical Movement has publicly declared his outrage! Or is there
precedent in the Patristic Tradition for the composition of a regulation for
confessional and inter-confessional common prayer, as happened at the
WCC? Do any of the above have anything to do with your argument about
“whether their grocer, their roommate, or the person in the next seat on an
airplane is an Orthodox faithful and not heterodox or of another religion”?
Enough already!
Dearth of Arguments (b)
You ask me,
“Do all the faithful of your parish, in whose service the Lord has
placed you, consciously belong to the sheepfold of the Good Shepherd? Do
they all observe the Gospel teachings and the traditions of the Church? Do
they all love one another? In their daily lives, do they apply all of the holy
canons according to the letter?” My answer is certainly no! You are
obviously saying that, since the faithful do not observe the holy canons in
other matters, it is therefore not too bad if the canons regarding common
prayer are also not applied. Let us abolish them! But, again, what sort of
argument is this? Then fornication and adultery would also not be
condemnable, since there are many faithful who lie! But also blasphemy
would not be unacceptable, since many steal! I wonder, is there any logic to
the above? If you rightly find them illogical, why do you apply this logic to
the holy canons about common prayer? “Why then this Manichaeism?”
Fr. George, the issue is not whether my parishioners and I sin, but
whether we are attempting to impose our lawlessness upon the ecclesiastical
conscience as though it were the law of God. Then we are no longer dealing
with the human propensity to sin but with dangerous demonic delusion which
approaches the boundaries of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, and this
blasphemy no “unanimous pan-Orthodox” decision can turn into imitable
virtue…
The Greatest and Least—Navel-
Gazers or Busy-Bodies
In discouraging me to engage the issue of common prayer you note,
“When
we have solved the substantial pastoral problems of our Church (and these
are very many), maybe then we will find some time to deal with what is
happening in the outside world.
”
This is a surprising assertion coming from a clergyman who serves with
diligence within the Ecumenical Movement, indeed for decades, and who
actively participates and follows down to the smallest detail “what is
happening in the outside world”! Unless this suggestion of Yours applies
only to those critical of the Ecumenical Movement…
If we accept Your logic as correct, Your objection should be chiefly
directed at the Ecumenical Patriarchate which, ostensibly, put the relevant
question to the professor and subsequently allowed for the publication in their
official journal, Episkesis, of a study of such length! Before telling me You
would have to express your objection first to Professor Vl. Pheidas who went
through the trouble of compiling a multi-page paper on common prayer rather
than dealing with “the substantial pastoral problems of our Church (and these
are very many)”!
And yet, the Ecumenical Throne and the professor judged, in my opinion
very rightly, that the matter of common prayers is among the serious issues
for the contemporary ecclesiastical reality. In the final analysis, what is
greater or lesser in ecclesiastical life is not for each of us to judge on his own.
I believe, however, that you will agree that anything which dissolves the
patristic teaching (as faith and as ethos), whether it be carried out by an
uncatechized layman or, much more so, by any clergyman of high rank, must
be approached with the utmost seriousness.
If participation in the Ecumenical Movement is a decision of our Church,
then we as members (clergy and laity) have not only a right, but an obligation
to pray, to be concerned, and to participate, to the measure of our ability, in
whatever takes place there. Pan-Orthodox decisions have nowhere relegated
this work solely to certain “professionals” (Bletsis) such that the rest of the
faithful, even “clergy, bishops and presbyters”
, are not permitted to “touch”
this question! Such an approach is evidence of an ecclesiological pathogeny,
and as such we are all obliged to condemn it unequivocally!
Finally, I often find myself faced with the following paradox: as many of
us as are not involved in the Ecumenical Movement and set pastoral work
within the Orthodox people as our first priority are condemned by ecumenical
circles as being introverted, navel-gazers and parochialists! When, however,
we take up the task of becoming involved and expressing our view regarding
certain behaviors, which we judge as antithetical to our tradition, then we are
accused by the same circles of being busy-bodies and lacking concern for our
flock! Does it so happen that we faithful (clergy and laity) have a right to
speak about Ecumenism only when we uncritically applaud what is being
done?
“Worldly Spirit”
A great portion of Your letter refers to the “worldly spirit” which truly erodes
our ecclesiastical life. I agree with You totally about this danger! Be certain
that we are pained over this unravelling and it is being treated as our chief
pastoral responsibility. Nonetheless, the reference to this situation in light of
the present question seems to be a diversion so that You will not have to deal
with common prayers. Why should the saying “these ought ye to have done,
and not to leave the other undone”377 not apply in the present situation?
But, Fr. George, what is a “worldly spirit”? Is it not first and foremost the
denial of the Gospel Truth and all that comes with this denial? Is it not a
“worldly spirit” to assert my own personal opinion,
“my own will,
” in
opposition to the conscience and tradition of the Church? And when this
happens on the part of the simple, uncatechized faithful,
“small” is the sin.
When, however, it is committed by those holding the first place of
prominence within our Church, then it is a crime! When this mindset
becomes enshrined within Church life as a rule, then have we not achieved
total conformity with the world? When a bishop decides and, in proportion
with his position within the hierarchy, imposes whatever he finds worthy of
observance from within canonical tradition while shamelessly—yes!
shamelessly—ignoring the rest, why does it bother us when a layman does
the same? Or does perhaps the “worldly spirit” regard only the laity and not
us clergymen?
Furthermore, let us not forget that this “worldly spirit” has taken on an
“ecclesiastical” form in Papism and Protestantism. And what a fall it would
be if we Orthodox clergymen were to be corrupted into thinking in a
Protestant way (by putting our own will and our own perspective first) and
acting in a Papist way (by imposing the said perspective)—especially when
because of our position we have the means…
Selective Use
You accuse me of making selective use of the holy canons. I believe You do
me injustice, since You will find such behavior among those who on the one
hand systematically ignore canons regarding common prayer, and yet on the
other elevate those dealing with their own jurisdiction and authority to the
level of the highest dogma!
Beloved Fr. George, I have extended my letter, perhaps too much. I was
perhaps somewhat harsh at certain points. I ask forgiveness if I upset You. Be
sure that they refer to no person, but rather to attitudes and behaviors which
greatly embitter us. I am struggling to acquire the “good thoughts” of St.
Paisios and to find justifications for our shepherds, yet those who preside
over the Ecumenical Movement do not “assist” me with their words and
actions.
I am unable to justify their stance toward their follow Orthodox brethren
and children: they make no effort to be informed about and to answer the
concerns of their Orthodox brethren with a theological word. There is a
provocative indifference or even contempt of the pain of their children. Yet
woe to the father that contemns the anxious cry of his children. He himself is
undermining his paternal authority in their conscience. And let it not escape
us that paternal authority is not established by muzzling criticism, but is
communicated through inspiration even unto the “naughty” children. If this is
the case with biological fatherhood, it is much more applicable to the spiritual
one!
In the present case there is not only contempt for the faithful laity, but
even hierarchs, clergymen, abbots with their brotherhoods—among the most
respected in all things—are met only with sarcasm and intense verbal insults
without any substantial theological rebuttal if they dare to express their
reservations! They are called extremists, zealots, Old Calendarists,
schismatics, neo-oppositionists, to use only the more comely and not the
obscene characterizations with which they “decorate” us. With bitterness do I
recall the characterizations which a hierarch of the Church of Greece
verbalized upon the Thronal Feast of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 2006
addressing the Ecumenical Patriarch, and in fact in the presence of
representatives of the heterodox—alas! “stubborn, false would-be brothers,
constituting groups of fanatical supporters of supposed ‘institutions’
, slaves
in many ways of a religious faithlessness, of a neo-manichaeanistic
fundamentalism, of a projected metaphysical guilt, of an easy work so that
they may live like sects, they, the buyers and sellers of ‘pure religion’
”378
.
And unfortunately, our Patriarch “heard him gladly”379 rather than
immediately bringing him back to order!
However, let it be made clear to all that the hierarchs, the Athonites and
other abbots and other clergymen and monastics and laity from many local
Orthodox Churches, who before God and our conscience express our grief
and disagreement over this systematic departure from our ecclesiastical
tradition, we are and shall remain members of our Church come what may!
Even if our Fathers embitter us and deny their fatherhood through their
behavior, we shall remain members of our Orthodox Church!
With love in Christ,
Fr. Anastasios Gotsopoulos

dogmas of the faith, but on account of certain ecclesiastical easily adjustable questions” (St.
Nikodemos of the Hagiorite, Interpretation of the first canon of Basil the Great, The Rudder).
Since, however, the boundaries between schism and heresy were not easily discerned,

17. Since the ecumenical councils are the highest administrative instrument of the Church, their
decisions have catholic-universal validity in Her life in history. Consequently, the canons which
the ecumenical councils issued or validated are not the opinions of isolated saints but decisions of
the whole Church: “It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us,
” the Fathers of the Councils
reiterate along with the Holy Apostles (Acts 15:28). For this reason all of us, clergy and laity alike,
owe them our respect. Otherwise, the consequences of ignoring and scorning the holy canons are
very serious for the personal spiritual life and ministry of every Christian and of the Church as a
whole. Church history verifies the epilogue of the apostolic canons, which states,
“Thus do we
declare unto you the bishops: By remaining in them [sc. the canons] ye will be saved, and have
peace, but if ye disobey ye will be damned, and will have everlasting battles against each other,
paying the appropriate price of your disobedience”! (The Rudder). St. Theodore the Studite says
regarding those who ignore the holy canons,
“He who thinks he has the right faith but is not guided
by the divine canons is not perfectly Orthodox but only halfway so” (PG 99, 989 A). The Sixth
Ecumenical Council notes: “This too has appeared best to this holy Council, as well as most
important, that the… canons…be henceforth retained and left firm and secure for the care of souls
and the cure of diseases…and no one shall be permitted to countermand or set aside the canons
previously laid down, or to recognize and accept any canons, other than the ones herein specified…
If, nevertheless, anyone be caught innovating with regard to any of the said canons, or attempting
to subvert it, he shall be responsible in respect of that canon and shall receive the penance which it
prescribes and be chastised by that canon which he has offended” (Canon 2), whereas in the
Seventh Ecumenical Council the Church declares,
“For those who have been allotted a sacerdotal
dignity, the representations of canonical ordinances amount to testimonies and directions. Gladly
accepting these…we welcome and embrace the divine canons, and we corroborate the entire and
rigid fiat of them… For all those men, having been guided by the light dawning out of the same
Spirit, prescribed rules that are to our best interest. Accordingly, we too anathematize whomsoever
they consign to anathema; and we too depose whomsoever they consign to deposition; and we too
excommunicate whomsoever they consign to excommunication; and we likewise subject to a
penance anyone whom they make liable to a penance” (Canon 1).
18. The Greek term ἀκοινώνητος, rendered as “excommunicated person”
, refers to anyone that is
barred from communion, not only those that used to be in communion and then were excluded
from it (ἀφορισμένοι, excommunicates in the strict sense), but also those that were never in
communion, e.g. heretics who grew up in their heresies.

heretical”

21. Ecclesiastical economia is a concept closely tied to that of canonical exactitude (κανονικὴ
ἀκρίβεια, akribeia). Exactitude is the application of the canons “exactly” or “precisely” as the
canons prescribe. Economia, on the other hand, is a temporary “detour” from the road of canonical
exactitude, to a greater or lesser degree of strictness, in dealing with a specific, exceptional case,
when the exact application of a canon’s provisions is deemed to be not the most beneficial. The
aim of both exactitude and economia is always the salvation of those to whom they are applied.
The application of economia is not solely based upon the decision of the bishop or priest, but must
be done according to the presuppositions and within the boundaries laid down by the experience
and wisdom of the Holy Fathers.
—ED.
22.
“The canons which govern the relations of Orthodox Christians with the heterodox and those of
other religions are unenforceable and must be changed. It is not possible for the Church to have
ordinances prohibiting the entry of the heterodox into the temples and common prayer with them
while at the same time through her representatives She prays publicly with them for the final unity
in faith, love, and hope. More love must “water” the canonical ordinances “for the begetting of
life”
. There exists the imperative need for the modification of certain ordinances unto a form more
philanthropic and realistic” (Bartholomew, Κωδικοποίηση [Codification], p. 73).

“We often criticise the monks of Mount Athos for their opposition to Ecumenism and we gladly
accuse them of sacrificing love for the sake of truth. From our first trip (while we were still Roman
Catholics and the thought of becoming Orthodox was totally foreign to us), it was very easy for us
to appreciate how much the monks of Mt. Athos know about combining a love very refined and
very much given over toward the care of others—regardless of their beliefs and of where they
belong confessionally—with an unwavering stance on dogmatic matters. Besides, for them, total
respect for the truth is one of the chief duties imposed on them by love for the other” (P. Deseille,
My Course Towards Orthodoxy, p. 52).
89. Cf. the stance of Abbas Arsenios, Poemen, and Lot in Sayings of the Desert Fathers, pp. 62, 92.
90. See the interpretation of the 33rd apostolic canon. Also,
“since dogmatic differences belong only
under the heading of ‘faith’
, they leave free and unthreatened the heading of ‘love’
.
” Dogma is not
at war with love. Love lends itself to dogma, since it bears all things, endures all things. Christian
love is unchanging, and not even the defective faith of the heterodox is capable of changing our
feeling of love toward them… Love must never be sacrificed for the sake of some dogmatic
difference.
” (St. Nectarius, Μάθημα Ποιμαντικῆς [A Lesson in Pastoral Theology], p. 192. St. John
Chrysostom says,
“If we were to hate the enemies of God, we would have to hate not only the
impious but sinners also; and thus we shall become worse than beasts, turning away from all men,
and swollen with madness” (St. John Chrysostom, Interpretation of 1st Corinthians, Sermon 33,
PG 61, 283).

93. Regarding the meaning of the term economia, see S. Troianos,
“Der Begriff der Oikonomia im
byzantinischen Recht”
, p. 141.
“The holy canons rarely use the term (viz.
‘economia’) but prefer
the terms ‘love of man’ [φιλανθρωπία] and ‘leniency’ [ἐπιείκια] (Canons 5, 11, 12 of the First
Ecumenical Council at Nicaea and 30 of the one in Chalcedon). The term oikonomia responds to
Canons 29, 30, 37, 102 of the Quinisext in the sense of condescension and arrangement.
Elsewhere, the term oikonomia (Canon 2 of the Second Ecumenical Council) ought to be
interpreted as meaning ‘ordination’”

105. The Church “for twenty centuries now has never formally defined in council in some special
document, canonical or otherwise, the things concerning economia in precision and detail”
(Bartholomeos Archontonis [current Ecumenical Patriarch],
“Ἡ Οἰκονομία ἐν τῇ Ὀρθοδόξῳ
Ἐκκλησίᾳ”
, p. 13). The First Pan-Orthodox Assembly (Rhodes 1961) had taken up the issue of
ecclesiastical economia within its agenda (item i, ch. 7,
‘Theological Issues’). The Fourth Pan-
Orthodox Assembly (Chambesy, 1968) assigned to the Church of Romania the study of this matter,
and the Preparatory Commission of the Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church (16-18
July 1971) finally arrived at the paper “Economia in the Orthodox Church” (see bibliography under
‘Inter-Orthodox’), which was heavily criticised, as a result of which this topic was withdrawn
(Bartholomew, Oikonomia, pp. 39-41). A thorough critique on the text of the Preparatory
Commission was conducted by the professors P. Bratsiotis, P. Trembelas, K. Mouratidis, A.
Theodorou, N. Bratsiotis in their Memorandum to the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece, June 5,
1972 (which also circulated separately). Methodios Fouyas (Metropolitan of Axum) responded to
the above in a series of articles published in the magazine Ἐκκλησιαστικός Φάρος, which were
republished in Fouyas, Economia. An exchange of letters with Professor P. Trembelas in
Ορθόδοξος Τύπος [Orthodox Press] ensued (15 Feb. 1974, 1 Apr. 1974).

“it is done not
due to slothfulness and contempt but solely out of need” (Kotsonis, Οἰκονομία, p. 102).
Additionally, many canons cite the use of economia out of need (e.g. 69th Apostolic, 2nd of the
First Ec. Council (“Forasmuch as, either from necessity, or through some other urgency of
individuals, many things have been done contrary to the ecclesiastical canon”), 12th of the council
in Neocaesarea].
108. Alivizatos, Οἰκονομία, p. 62, see also Karmiris, pp. 972-973. In the paper of the Inter-Orthodox
Preparatory Commission of the Holy and Great Council it is emphasized that economia in
Orthodoxy is applied “with measure…in whatever is needed, whenever needed, and as often as
needed”

“economia also has the same
seasons and bounds and measures of things, maintaining the Church undisturbed and whole and
unshaken for ever, lest by overusing economia She fall into transgression [paranomia] and present
her temporary yieldings and condescensions as main and of equal force to exactitude of the divine
laws from which She condescended”

but also in the examination of the results which this is capable of producing within the whole life
of the Church. If, in other words…this action of his does not bring about a general paralysis or
subversion of ecclesiastical order, then it constitutes ‘economia’

“common house”
, saying,
“One must not enter into these churches at all…for as soon as heresy
was introduced, the guardian angel thereof departed, according to the witness of St. Basil the Great,
and such a temple is henceforth a common house. And as it is said,
‘I will not enter into the
congregation of evil-doers’” (RP, Σύνταγμα, vol. 4, p. 431d; the scriptural reference is a paraphrase
of Ps. 25:5). Responding to the same question, Athanasius the Great says the following concerning
entrance into temples of heretics when there is no Orthodox temple nearby: “If there is great and
grievous danger in committing adultery against one’s own wife and having sexual intercourse with
another, even if the husband be in a foreign land, how much greater still is the danger in betraying
the true faith by having communion with heretics?”(Athanasius the Great, To Antiochus the
Archon, regarding questions both plentiful and needful: Question 112, PG 28, 665D).

“Latin” was the Roman term of that time (13th century) for all westerners, who fell under the
jurisdiction of the Pope of Rome (i.e. were “Roman Catholics”) and had Latin either as their
mother tongue (in the form of a Romance language) or as their official, religious, and literary
language (as did, for example, the Germans). A synonym of this was “Frank”
, which had more
national connotations, while “Latin” was a more religious term. The Romans, on the other hand,
living within the Roman Empire with its capital at Constantinople, were Greek-speaking and
Orthodox Christians. In a religious context,
“Roman” could be used interchangeably with
“Orthodox”
, just as “Saracen” could be used as a synonym for “Muslim”
.

“Liturgy of Lima” is the characterization of the celebration of a supposedly “ecumenical
eucharist” by the Archbishop of Canterbury, with an open invitation to all Confessions, in the
framework of the General Assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC) at Vancouver (8-4-
1983). Around 3,500 individuals participated independently of their confession (Newsweek, 8-22-
1983). This “liturgy” was repeated in the General Assembly in Canberra (2-10-1991), also with the
participation of two women “priests”
. Since then because of strict criticism it has not been repeated
(Bouteneff, The Challenge of Common Prayer, p. 132). See also par. 38 in Appendix A,

the Studite in 1030: “Indeed from now and in the Holy Spirit to the Churches everywhere we order
those most God-pleasing Hierarchs to whom the lot has fallen to preside over the Churches
vigilantly to observe the parishes that fall to their share and by every power to rebut the chiefs of
the heresies as audacious wolves. Since these ones unwaveringly persist in the cacodoxy of the rest
of the heresiarchs, we do not tolerate that they even be called by the name of bishop at all, nor that
some heresiarch be called first among them or be allowed to ordain or to conduct any other priestly
office unworthily”
, in Kotsonis, Intercommunio, p. 201.
191. According to Canon 1 of the Council of Carthage,
“among the heretics, where there is no church…
it is impossible for the heretic, who has neither altar nor Church…
”
. Interpreting the Orthodox self-
conciousness the dominican theologian Y. Congar relates: “Christian antiquity always refused to
give the name of ‘Church’ to bodies which had been severed from the singular visible Church,
which was the “catholic” Church, namely the true and orthodox one. It was inconceivable for them
that there could be a Church without the attributes of the Church, which the Nicean-
Constantinopolitan Creed rendered: one, holy, catholic and apostolic. For this they named the
communities severed from the unity with different names, excluding the name of ‘Church,
’ except
if they were using it with the empirical meaning of ‘congregation’
”
…
, in P. Deseille, My course
towards Orthodoxy, p. 134; According to S. L. Greenslade, according to the concordant teaching of
the Fathers, which is supported in the New Testament, the Church not only “ought to be one, but is
one and cannot be anything but one. This unity was (for them) an attribute of the visible Church,
and the visible Church was understood as one and only structure, one communion. According to
them [the Fathers], the divisions, the disruptions of communion, were not covered neither
dominated by a single spiritual and invisible unity, and different names could not form the one and
only Church. There was nothing but the one visible Church in a one and only communion. The
bodies severed from this communion were outside of the Church” in P. Deseille, My course
towards Orthodoxy, pp. 140-141.

200. St. Cyril of Jerusalem says concerning this,
“Do not think that that kiss is related to those given in
the marketplace by common friends. Therefore this kiss is not of that sort” (PG 33, 1112A).
“Among eucharistic symbolisms, the special token of reconciliation before partaking of the holy
Eucharist and sign of proper brotherly relationships is the ritual of the kiss of peace, which hails
back to the years of the New Testament. The kiss was not at all symbolic or virtual but the living
expression, the sacred act, of the love itself” (Tsombanidis, Λειτουργία μετά τή Λειτουργία, p. 180-
181).

“The canonical order of the Orthodox Church is based, on the one hand, on the holy canons of
both the Ecumenical and the Local Councils and, on the other hand, on the established, time-
honoured, long-lasting ecclesiastical practice… The 3rd holy canon of the Second Ecumenical, the
9th, 17th, and 28th of the Fourth Ecumenical, the 36th of the Quinisext Ecumenical, as well as all
the holy canons that refer to the Patriarchal system of ecclesiastical governance constitute not only
an organic and inalienable element of Orthodox canonical order but also an unequivocal criterion
for the orderly functioning of inter-orthodox relations in every age. The authority of the Orthodox
canonical tradition, established by the long-lasting ecclesiastical practice, gushing forth from the
foundational principle of the Orthodox Church regarding the nature of the Local Church, is
certainly not subject to arbitrary or circumstantial misinterpretations, according to what is at each
time in the interests of the one or the other local church” (Bartholomew,
“Letter to the Patriarch of
Moscow Alexei”).
253. When the autocephaly of the Church of Greece was declared (1833) and later also recognised by
the Ecumenical Patriarchate (1850), the borders of the new local church included only the lands
that had been freed up to that point. The lands that were won in later years (viz. what is now
northern Greece, the regions of Epirus and Macedonia in 1912 and of Thrace in 1920, along with
several islands) were then given to the Church of Greece for all practical purposes, with the
exception that the Patriarch was still to be commemorated in the Liturgy and to remain the spiritual
leader of the faithful of those territories, which are known as “the New Lands”
. Considering the
depopulation of Orthodox faithful in Asia Minor, the topic of the New Lands is understandably a
sensitive one.

Saint Irene (10.5.2002) in the city of Patras. The heterodox that delivered these sacred objects were

have been confirmed by the rhetorical question with which Mr. P. Andriopoulos concludes his

choir of the Catholic church [in Patras]? Are they to be excommunicated for praying together with
‘heretics’?”! Professor Sava Agouridis speaks of “deviations… Some of the Orthodox who are

faith, is not anti-ecumenical at heart, even though there dogmatic truth is experienced as a fullness
of life and canonical exactitude [akribeia] is experienced as an expression of true love, as the
Athonite fathers themselves say. They receive everyone with much love, and they feel that it is
precisely this love that dictates complete respect for the truth, without any deviation from it…
Their persistence in the faith and in the truth does not mean that there is no space for understanding
and love toward the one with whom we disagree”
, and Bartholomew, Oikonomia, p. 46: “On the
Holy Mountain again for reasons of love [antidoron] is not given [to the heterodox], with the
justification that in this way the same or even greater blessing is bestowed, and this is completely
acceptable for the well-disposed heterodox visitors of Athos”
.
321.
“We often criticize the monks of Mount Athos for their opposition to Ecumenism and we gladly
accuse them of sacrificing love for the sake of truth. From our first trip (while we were still Roman
Catholics and the thought of becoming Orthodox was totally foreign to us), it was very easy for us
to appreciate how much the monks of Mt. Athos know about combining a love very refined and
very much given over toward the care of others—regardless of their beliefs and of where they
belong confessionally—with an unwavering stance on dogmatic matters. Besides, for them, total
respect for the truth is one of the chief duties imposed on them by love for the other” (P. Deseille,
My course towards Orthodoxy, p. 52).
322. The following words of Ecumenical Patriarch Demetrius precisely define the role of the people of
God: “The final judgement of all that are being carried out in the dialogue and of all that will
finally be achieved lies in the hands of the Churches, as administrating and deciding instruments of
divine inspiration, but also to the faithful people of God itself. This people, by the infallible
criterion of its own faith and the witness of its own conscience, accepts what has been decided in a
God-pleasing manner while rejecting the fabrications that are not pleasing to God” (Episkepsis
326/1 Dec. 1984).
323. Stylianos, Archbishop of Australia (for twenty years co-president of the Official Theological
Dialogue with the Roman Catholics), referring to “tragic mistakes” that have occurred in this
respect, emphasises that “unfortunately [these mistakes] create much commotion, much harm,
without producing any profit at all for us. Thus we give the impression that we are hastening to
achieve intercommunio, and sacramental communion with the heterodox… we cause only harm
and do not help the dialogue at all” (“The Theological Dialogue between Orthodox and Roman
Catholics”

Ferrara-Florence the Latin-minded “were planning and forging the Union through secret pacts,
without informing all the members of the representation so as to avoid any reactions, just as today
the faithful people is not informed and therefore does not comprehend that the Union is being
achieved gradually, that it has substantially progressed with common prayers, with co-celebrations,
and with mutual ecclesiastical recognition, in such a way that the Common Cup, whenever it is
made official, will be merely the seal and confirmation of an already accomplished Union” (Zisis,

329. Fr. George Florovsky characteristically notes,
“I consider participation not only permissible and
possible for Orthodox Christians but even an immediate duty that flows from the very essence of
the Orthodox conscience and the obligation of the true Church to give her witness unceasingly
everywhere… I view Orthodox participation in the Ecumenical Movement under the lens of
missionary activity. The Orthodox Church is especially called to participation precisely in the
ecumenical exchange of ideas because She recognises herself as the guardian of the apostolic faith
and tradition in its catholicity and fullness and that, in this sense, She is the true Church.
Orthodoxy is the catholic truth, the truth for the whole world, for ever and for all the nations”

Deseille, My course towards Orthodoxy, pp. 121-122. For the similar views of St. Justin Popovich,

335. Cf. the reactions of certain circles against the “Confession of Faith Against Ecumenism”
. The
importance and effectiveness of this work is proven by the fact that they lost their composure. The
following characterisations, posted on a weblog concerning the “Confession” and those that signed
it, are a good example of this: “deformed, spit-worthy, delirious, disgusting, fascists, neo-
Orthodox, not thinking, a manichaistic novelty, having diabolical demands, noetic swine, ravenous
monsters, sick in mind, liars and hypocrites, Lucifer’s inspiration, Hippian audacity, perverted
minds, blackness of soul, servile, schizofreneia!, all they that signed this should go to the Old
Calendarists, they should go to Buddhism to calm down, oh how many insane asylums it will take
to accomodate these fanatics, the point is to isolate these foreign elements from the Church,
” and
of course the indispensable street slogan,
“Down with the fascism of the dishonorable Confession
of Faith,
” and so forth. And just to think that the Confession has been signed even by hierarchs and
other clergymen nearly from all Orthodox churches and Athonite abbots, which were recently
praised by the Patriarch and congratulated for their sensitivity on matters of faith!
The aforementioned characterisations (very mild compared to the other ones posted on this
weblog concerning those that criticise ecumenistic transgressions) were written by the same
theologian that sees no problem if Orthodox Christians go to church and chant on a regular basis
every Sunday in the Roman Catholic Church of Patras. He is the same one who wrote that in order
to uproot from his city opinions with which he disagrees “bulldozers are not enough: it would take
explosions and many kilograms of dynamite”! Oh what noteworthy ecclesiastical words of a
theologian, remarkable argumentation, enviable progressive thought, and most of all, exemplary
Christian ethos…
Of course “of the abundance of the heart man speaketh” (Luke 6:45): whatever he has in his
internal world, that he will also express… Yet it is indicative of decline and decadence that those
who make such characterisations against hierarchs, clergymen, and respected professors of
theology are supposedly defending the inter-Christian and interreligious dialogues and of course
they cannot articulate a serious theological argument against their Orthodox brethren. Only
contumelies, sarcasm, and mockery; no argumentation against the Confession! And what is worse
and most unsettling (let us now put our finger into the print of the nails [i.e. get to the essence of
the matter —ED.]) men of such ethos are accepted to present themselves as genuine defenders of
the Ecumenical Patriarchate, while those who express their criticism of certain of its actions
responsible and with theological documentation are treated as… its enemies. This is truly worthy
of grief and most of all of prayers, prayer for the Church and her shepherds.

Shepherd and Primate out of the West, and auspiciously exulteth in piety while beseeching Christ:
By Thy power guard Thy world, preserving it in oneness of mind as one exceedingly good”; and
