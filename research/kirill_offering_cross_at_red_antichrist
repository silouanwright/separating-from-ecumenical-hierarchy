Title: Patriarch Kirill offering the Holy Cross at a monument glorifying the Red Antichrist
Author / Publisher: Gregory Decapolite

"Gregory Decapolite":

(It must be asked: how is it possible to honor the Holy New Martyrs of Russia while apparently also honoring the Soviet government which killed them?

This Soviet government was the only one in all of history to be anathematized by the Orthodox Church at the All-Russian Councifull up for p of 1917-18.

The footage in this video occurred just a short year after Patriarch Kirill blessed a statue to the betrayer and persecutor of the Church Metropolitan and later "Patriarch" Sergius.) 3:01

## Background and Context

The YouTube video in question, produced by Gregory Decapolite, raises critical questions about the actions of Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, focusing on the apparent contradiction between honoring the **Holy New Martyrs of Russia**—Orthodox Christians killed during the Soviet regime—and, at the same time, venerating elements or figures associated with the Soviet authorities, who were responsible for their persecution and death.

### Key Claims and Controversies

- **Monuments and Blessings:** The video alleges that Patriarch Kirill participated in the consecration or blessing of monuments that, according to critics, signal an ambiguous relationship with the memory of the Soviet government. Specifically, it is noted that he blessed a monument to Metropolitan (later Patriarch) Sergius, a figure seen by critics as a "betrayer" for his historically controversial collaboration with the Soviet authorities[1][2].
- **Theological Tensions:** Critics highlight the paradox of commemorating the New Martyrs—canonized for their suffering under atheistic Soviet oppression—while also engaging in ceremonies or rhetoric that seem to honor the very government or its collaborators. This complexity is felt acutely because the Russian Orthodox Church formally anathematized the Soviet regime in 1918 for its anti-Christian and repressive policies[3][4].

## Historical and Ecclesiastical Context

### Anathematization of the Soviet Government

- **1918 Anathema:** In January 1918, Patriarch Tikhon officially anathematized the Bolshevik government, branding it an antichristian entity. This anathema was then confirmed by the All-Russian Church Council[3][4]. The decree explicitly stated the incompatibility of the true Christian Church with the "power of the spirit of antichrist" embodied by the Soviet state.

### Holy New Martyrs of Russia

- **Who Are They?:** The New Martyrs and Confessors are saints canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church, recognized for their endurance and faith while suffering and dying at the hands of the Soviet authorities after the October Revolution of 1917[5][6].
- **Commemoration:** The Church honors their memory, especially since the post-Soviet period, with a dedicated feast and by adding more names to the official list as evidence and investigations allow[6][5].

### Patriarch Sergius (Stragorodsky) and His Legacy

- **Collaboration Accusations:** Metropolitan Sergius became a controversial figure for many because, during the Stalinist purges, he accepted the Soviet regime's authority over the Church and issued a declaration of loyalty to the state. This move is seen by some as necessary compromise, and by others as betrayal[1][2].
- **Modern-Veneration Controversy:** Recent ceremonies in which Patriarch Kirill blessed a monument to Sergius sparked critique from traditionalist Orthodox circles and commentators like Gregory Decapolite, who see this as glorifying a figure closely associated with capitulation to persecution[1][2].

### Patriarch Kirill's Statements about Evil and the Antichrist

- **Contemporary Rhetoric:** Patriarch Kirill has repeatedly invoked apocalyptic and cosmic language in speeches, describing the modern Russian state and church as a “restraining force” against the Antichrist—a theological concept in Orthodoxy that traditionally refers to the opposing figure of the last days[7][8][9]. This has led to both support and condemnation, with some opponents accusing Kirill of manipulating religious language to support present-day political goals and, paradoxically, aligning with evil by blessing actions or monuments associated with former persecutors of the faith[10].

| Element                      | Description                                                                                     | Sources         |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Anathema of Soviet Gov't** | Officially condemned as "antichristian" by the Orthodox Church in 1918                        | [3][4]        |
| **New Martyrs**              | Christians killed by the Soviet regime, now honored as saints                                 | [6][5]        |
| **Patriarch Sergius**        | Controversially collaborated with Soviets; blessed by Kirill with a monument                  | [1][2]        |
| **Patriarch Kirill Critique**| Criticized for statements and ceremonies perceived as aligning with or glorifying Soviet figures | [10][7][8][9] |

## Summary of Reactions

- **Among Orthodox Faithful:** Critics, especially among more traditionalist and “catacomb” Orthodox, see any glorification of Soviet or Soviet-collaborating figures as a betrayal of the martyrs' memory and a theological contradiction.
- **Among Hierarchs and Commentators:** Some bishops and public figures accuse Patriarch Kirill of serving politicized interests or fostering ideological confusion by mixing the rhetoric of martyrdom with acts that seem to vindicate the persecutors[10][7][8][9].

## Conclusion

Gregory Decapolite’s video expresses a concern widely shared among critics of the Moscow Patriarchate’s current orientation. The tension between honoring the Holy New Martyrs and participating in ceremonies perceived as whitewashing or glorifying elements tied to Soviet persecution is a live and divisive issue. Church documents confirm the historical anathematization of the Soviet state, and recent actions by Patriarch Kirill—such as blessing monuments and invoking apocalyptic rhetoric—continue to fuel debate over the Russian Church’s relationship with its own history and with contemporary Russian identity[10][1][9][3][4].
