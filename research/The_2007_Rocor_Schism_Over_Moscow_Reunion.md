# The 2007 ROCOR schism over Moscow reunion

The May 17, 2007 reconciliation between the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and the Moscow Patriarchate triggered a significant ecclesiastical split, with approximately 1-3% of ROCOR refusing communion and forming separate jurisdictions. Led by Bishop Agathangel (Pashkovsky) of Odessa, these groups cited Moscow's ecumenical activities and "Sergianism" as canonical barriers to reunion, establishing parallel church structures that remain fragmented and marginal nearly two decades later.

## The bishops who refused communion

**Bishop Agathangel (Pashkovsky) of Odessa** emerged as the primary leader of opposition to the 2007 reunion. Born Michael Ivanovich Pashkovsky on November 22, 1956, he had served as ROCOR's bishop for Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova since 1996. Despite initially signing the 2006 Council epistle supporting reconciliation, Agathangel reversed course and declared on May 22, 2007 that he "does not accept the document" of canonical communion.

The ROCOR Synod suspended Agathangel on May 20, 2007 for inciting schism and disobeying lawful authority. In response, he organized a "Provisional Supreme Church Authority" (PSCA) and on December 7-8, 2007, with assistance from Greek Old Calendarist bishops, consecrated two new bishops to formalize the schism:

- **Bishop Andronik (Kotliaroff)** of Richmond Hill and New York - Former head of ROCOR's Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, born in 1951 in China to Russian refugee parents
- **Bishop Sophronius (Musienko)** of Saint Petersburg and Northern Russia - Previously a hieromonk in ROCOR

Other bishops expressed reservations but ultimately remained with ROCOR. **Bishop Daniel (Alexandrov) of Erie**, the vicar bishop for Old Ritualists, submitted written objections to the 2006 Sobor warning against "self-destruction" and "suicide" of ROCOR through reunion. However, he maintained communion with Metropolitan Laurus throughout the process and died in 2010 within the canonical church.

The opposition drew primarily from Agathangel's Ukrainian parishes, with additional support from scattered communities internationally. Contemporary estimates suggested "about a dozen clergy" initially supported the split, with parishes and monasteries going to various destinations including the Synod in Resistance under Metropolitan Cyprian (3 monasteries, 1 parish), the Russian True Orthodox Church under Archbishop Tikhon (4-5 American parishes, 5 Australian priests), and other Old Calendarist jurisdictions.

## Formation of ROCOR-A and splinter groups

The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad - Provisional Supreme Church Authority (commonly ROCOR-A) crystallized around Metropolitan Agathangel following his December 2007 episcopal consecrations. On November 19, 2008, the group's Fifth All-Diaspora Council elevated Agathangel to metropolitan rank, establishing a formal synodal structure.

**ROCOR-A's organizational framework** included:
- Metropolitan Agathangel as First-Hierarch based in Odessa
- Archbishop Andronik overseeing North American operations from New York
- Archbishop Sophronius administering Northern Russian territories
- Claimed canonical authority through Patriarch Tikhon's 1920 Ukase No. 362

The geographical distribution concentrated in **Ukraine** (Agathangel's stronghold), the **United States** (parishes in Valley Cottage and Brooklyn, New York), **Canada**, **Russia** (areas near the Ukrainian border), and **South America** (significant portion of ROCOR's Latin American presence).

Beyond ROCOR-A, the opposition fragmented into multiple competing groups. The **Russian Orthodox Church in Exile (ROCiE)**, originally formed by Metropolitan Vitaly (Ustinov) in 2001 after his contested retirement, continued opposing the Moscow reunion but splintered after Vitaly's 2006 death into:
- ROCiE (V/A) under Bishops Vladimir and Anastasios
- ROCIE (A) under Metropolitan Anthony (Orlov)
- ROCIE (A-D) under Metropolitan Damascene (Balabanov)

The **Russian True Orthodox Church (RTOC)**, formed in 2002 by former ROCOR bishops Lazar and Benjamin, also attracted defectors from the 2007 reunion. Additional groups emerged under various hierarchs, each claiming legitimate succession from pre-2007 ROCOR while maintaining communion with Greek, Romanian, and Bulgarian Old Calendarist churches.

By 2017, ROCOR-A itself experienced major division when Archbishops Andronik and Sophronius broke with Agathangel over his "quasi-Papal attitude," forming the separate "Diaspora District of ROCA" and establishing communion with the Serbian True Orthodox Church.

## Theological objections to Moscow's ecumenism

The separatist groups articulated comprehensive theological objections centered on ROCOR's **1983 Anathema Against Ecumenism**, which declared:

> "Those who attack the Church of Christ by teaching that Christ's Church is divided into so-called 'branches' which differ in doctrine and way of life... and who do not distinguish the priesthood and mysteries of the Church from those of the heretics, but say that the baptism and eucharist of heretics is effectual for salvation; therefore, to those who knowingly have communion with these aforementioned heretics or who advocate, disseminate, or defend their new heresy of Ecumenism under the pretext of brotherly love or the supposed unification of separated Christians, **Anathema!**"

Metropolitan Philaret's synod had characterized ecumenism as "the most pernicious of heresies, for it has gathered all the heresies that exist or have existed and has called this union a Churchâ€”a deed that savors of Antichrist."

**Specific objections to Moscow's World Council of Churches membership** included:

1. **Ecclesiological compromise** - WCC participation violated Orthodox understanding of the Church as "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic" by implying Orthodoxy was merely one denomination among others

2. **Protestant influence** - Archpriest Georgii Grabbe argued ecumenism "does not seek unity in the true faith but replaces it with the fellowship of people of different opinions"

3. **Soviet manipulation** - Moscow's 1961 WCC entry was seen as orchestrated by Communist authorities for political purposes

The separatists particularly condemned Moscow's 1970 decision permitting Roman Catholics communion "in certain cases" and Metropolitan Nikodim's December 14, 1970 administration of communion to Catholic clerics in Saint Peter's Basilica. They cited **Apostolic Canons 45 and 46** prohibiting prayer with heretics and receiving their sacraments.

The groups rejected the "branch theory" - that Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican churches constitute three valid branches of Christianity - as undermining church unity and promoting theological relativism. They maintained strict Orthodox exclusivism, arguing participation in ecumenical dialogue inherently compromised the faith's integrity.

**"Sergianism"** formed another major objection, referring to Metropolitan Sergius Stragorodsky's 1927 declaration of loyalty to Soviet authorities. Separatists argued the Moscow Patriarchate retained fundamental canonical illegitimacy from this compromise, with current hierarchs seen as "appointees and agents of the former Soviet state."

## Metropolitan Vitaly's statements on ecumenism

Though Metropolitan Vitaly (Ustinov) died September 25, 2006, before the final reunion, his extensive anti-ecumenical writings provided theological framework for the opposition. As ROCOR's First-Hierarch from 1985-2001, Vitaly had paradoxically both promoted and condemned ecumenical contacts, creating contradictions his followers later struggled to reconcile.

**Key statements from Metropolitan Vitaly included:**

In his **June 2001 Encyclical Epistle**, Vitaly declared: "We must unequivocally admit that the establishment of a Commission 'on unity' with the Moscow Patriarchate was a mistake on the part of the Council of Bishops. There can be no such Commission as there is no object for its work."

His **October 14/27, 2001 Extraordinary Declaration** condemned ROCOR leadership's "new course of rapprochement with a pseudo-church, the Moscow Patriarchate -- and eucharistic communion with ecumenists," accusing them of seeking "dialogue or unification with ecumenical or world-orthodoxy, so-called."

Regarding the Serbian Church, Vitaly stated: "Following the Second World War, the Church that continued to exist under the Communist rule of Tito could no longer be considered to be the same Church... Her submission to the worldly rulers and her participation in the interfaith ecumenical movement do not allow us to ask for a eucharistic union with the Serbian Patriarchate."

As Archbishop of Montreal in 1984, Vitaly had defended the 1983 Anathema: "Against this monstrous teaching [ecumenism] a vast literature has grown up, revealing ecumenism to be the heresy of heresies... the time for discussion and polemics has passed and the time has come to judge this movement."

**Supporting bishops echoed these positions.** Bishop Barnabas (Prokofiev) of Cannes withdrew his signature from the October 2000 ROCOR Council epistle opening dialogue with Moscow. On March 8, 2001, he declared Bishop Ambrose deserved excommunication for "ecumenical heresy." In July 2001, Barnabas wrote supporting Vitaly's position against "the catastrophic situation in which the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia had been plunged."

The separatists invoked **canonical precedents** including the Fifteenth Canon of the First-Second Council: "Should a bishop publicly confess some heresy already condemned by the Holy Fathers and previous councils, one who ceases to commemorate such a bishop even before conciliar condemnation not only is not to be censured, but should be praised."

## Current status and canonical claims

Nearly two decades after the split, the separatist groups remain **ecclesiastically isolated and internally fragmented**. Combined membership likely numbers only in the thousands, representing a tiny fraction of global Orthodoxy.

**ROCOR-A under Metropolitan Agathangel** maintains synodal structure but has experienced significant internal strife. In 2017, Archbishops Andronik and Sophronius broke away citing Agathangel's authoritarian leadership, forming the "Diaspora District of ROCA." The group maintains parishes primarily in Ukraine, the United States, Canada, and Russia, though specific membership numbers remain unavailable.

**Institutional structures** across all groups include:
- Traditional Orthodox synodal governance
- Diocesan administrations with limited resources
- Few monasteries or theological schools
- Newspapers and websites promoting their positions
- Claimed canonical authority through Patriarch Tikhon's 1920 Ukase No. 362

**Theological positions remain consistent:**
- Strict anti-ecumenism based on the 1983 Anathema
- Rejection of "Sergianism" and church-state accommodation
- Old Calendar retention
- Monarchist political sympathies
- Opposition to modernism in Orthodox practice

**Canonical relationships** confine these groups to the margins. They maintain communion exclusively with:
- Holy Synod in Resistance (Greek Old Calendarists)
- True Orthodox Church of Romania (Old Calendar)
- Old Calendar Orthodox Church of Bulgaria
- Various other Old Calendarist groups

No mainstream Orthodox church recognizes their legitimacy. The Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and other patriarchates maintain full communion with Moscow and the reunited ROCOR. Even among Old Calendarists, the Russian groups face questions about their canonical standing and apostolic succession.

**Key challenges limiting growth include:**
- Ongoing internal fragmentation and personal conflicts
- Geographic concentration in traditional Russian diaspora areas
- Aging demographics with limited youth engagement
- Inability to establish sustainable institutions
- Ecclesiastical isolation from world Orthodoxy

The separatist groups effectively function as parallel religious communities serving specific populations committed to their theological and political positions. Their survival depends on maintaining Old Calendarist connections while preserving a distinct identity opposing both Moscow and mainstream ROCOR. Despite passionate theological convictions, their marginal status and continued fragmentation suggest limited long-term viability as independent church bodies.
