# Patristic Quotes Against Ecumenism from Orthodox Saints and Theologians

Based on extensive research, here is a comprehensive collection of direct quotes from Orthodox saints, theologians, and elders condemning ecumenism as dangerous or heretical:

## Saint Justin Popovich - The Pan-Heresy

Saint Justin Popovich, known as one of Orthodoxy's greatest 20th-century theologians, coined the term "pan-heresy" to describe ecumenism:

**"This dogma is the heresy of heresies, a revolt without precedent against the God-man Christ on this earth, a new betrayal of Christ, a new crucifixion of the Lord of Glory."**[1][2] He consistently referred to ecumenism as **"the pan-heresy"** - the heresy that encompasses all other heresies[3].

**"Every humanism is a heresy. The only way ecumenism can work again, the only way out so to speak is through repentance 'that leads to a full knowledge of the truth' (2Tim 2:25). This repentance must come by humbling oneself before the God-man, before His Church, before the Theotokos and all the saints."**[4]

According to Saint Justin, ecumenism represents **"papal humanism"** which **"leads to constant shedding of human blood in the world and the slaughter of human souls as a result."**[3]

## Metropolitan Philaret (Voznesensky) - The New Confessor

Metropolitan Philaret of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia issued powerful warnings against ecumenism in his famous epistles:

In his 1968 Lenten Epistle to Patriarch Athenagoras, he warned against the **"evil captivity"** of ecumenical compromise, stating that those who engage in it **"neither remained any longer what they were, nor became anything else"** - describing them as spiritually **"split people, like the mythical centaurs."**[5]

He consistently opposed any Orthodox participation in ecumenical activities that would compromise Orthodox truth, writing extensively about the dangers of the World Council of Churches and warning against the **"heresy of ecumenism."**[6]

## Elder Paisios of Mount Athos

Elder Paisios, recently canonized by the Orthodox Church, was uncompromising in his opposition to ecumenism:

**"There's no need for us to tell Christians who aren't Orthodox that they're going to hell or that they're antichrists; but we also mustn't tell them that they'll be saved, because that's giving them false reassurances, and we'll be judged for it. We have to give them a good kind of uneasiness – we have to tell them that they're in error."**[7]

**"In order for us to pray together with someone, we must agree on the faith."**[7][8] He cut off relationships with clergy who participated in common prayer with heterodox, and ceased commemorating Patriarch Athenagoras due to his **"dangerous overtures toward the Roman Catholics."**[7]

In his private letter on ecumenism, Elder Paisios described the Patriarch's ecumenical activities as **"worldly love"** that **"caused a sensational impression of sorts among many Orthodox"** and completely **"scandalized us, the children of Orthodoxy."**[9]

## Bishop Augoustinos Kantiotis

Bishop Augoustinos provided a detailed analysis of ecumenism's dangers:

**"Ecumenism is a revival of an old current, of Syncretism, in which our ancient progenitors and other peoples, doubting with regard to the truths of their Religions, tried to extinguish their metaphysical thirst... The followers of Ecumenism, to make easier, as they say, the creation of the brotherhood of all peoples under a common roof, they tend, through the mixing of various elements, to create a new Religion or rather a Super-religion, a mixture of truths and falsehoods."**[10]

**"The danger coming from Ecumenism is unimaginable. And only for the condemnation of Ecumenism, as a frightful heresy ravaging all of Orthodoxy, it is necessary for an Ecumenical Synod to be convened."**[10]

## Father Theodore Zisis

**"Ecumenism confounds everything. It does not believe that there is Orthodoxy; that there is Truth for which the Saints and Fathers struggled from the time of the Apostles."**[10]

## Metropolitan Seraphim of Kythira

**"For nineteen centuries the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church has refused to name various heretical Christian communities as Christian Churches... Are we not hiding the truth and light of Christ from them? Won't we, the Orthodox, answer on the day of judgment for constructing this spiritual tower of Babel and concealing the saving Truth of God?"**[10]

## Bishop Artemije of Rashka and Prizren

**"There is a peril much greater and more hideous than all the sects taken together, than even the satanists. That is the contemporary heresy, characteristic of our time – the heresy of ecumenism... That is not a mere heresy, but an all encompassing heresy."**[10]

He explained that ecumenism is **"more dangerous than had ever made its appearance in the history of Christ's Church"** because it seeks unity while stipulating that **"no one has to change anything in their beliefs or practice."**[10]

## Saint Mark of Ephesus

Though from an earlier era, Saint Mark's writings are directly applicable to modern ecumenism:

**"This is precisely the means by which many, from of old, have been deceived and persuaded to follow those who have led them off the steep precipice of impiety; believing that there is some middle ground between the two teachings that can reconcile obvious contradictions, they have been exposed to peril."**[11]

**"He that is not with Me is against Me; and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth abroad."**[12] He taught that **"we must not sanctify one of Latin race through the Divine and most pure Gifts by priestly hands, unless he shall first resolve to depart from Latin dogmas and customs and shall be catechized and joined to those of Orthodoxy."**[12]

## Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) Anathema

In 1983, ROCOR issued a formal anathema against ecumenism:

**"To those who attack the Church of Christ by teaching that Christ's Church is divided into so-called 'branches' which differ in doctrine and way of life, or that the Church does not exist visibly, but will be formed in the future when all 'branches' or sects or denominations, and even religions will be united into one body; and who do not distinguish the priesthood and mysteries of the Church from those of the heretics... to those who knowingly have communion with these aforementioned heretics or who advocate, disseminate, or defend their new heresy of Ecumenism under the pretext of brotherly love or the supposed unification of separated Christians, Anathema!"**[13][14]

## Archbishop Averky Taushev

**"Ecumenism is the most prevalent heresy of our times, and the most devastating heresy of all times."**[15]

He taught that ecumenism represents **"ancient heresies condemned by the Church at the Ecumenical Councils, for it hypocritically hides itself under the 'sheep's clothing' of pseudo-Christian love."**[16]

## Father Seraphim Rose

**"The ideology behind ecumenism is an already well-defined heresy: the Church of Christ does not exist, no one has the Truth, the Church is only now being built. But it takes little reflection to see that the self-liquidation of Orthodoxy, of the Church of Christ, is simultaneously the self-liquidation of Christianity itself."**[17]

He warned against both extremes - the **"ecumenical movement"** and excessive reaction to it that becomes **"excessive because it has the same worldly Spirit which is present in the ecumenical movement."**[18]

## Saint Gregory Palamas

Though not writing about modern ecumenism per se, Saint Gregory's condemnations of Latin heresies apply directly:

**"We will not receive you Latins in communion with us as long as you say that the Spirit is also from the Son."**[19] He **"considered the Latins heretics"** and **"deemed, by extension, the Latin hierarchs, the Pope included, to be in heresy and under anathema."**[19]

## Elder Joseph the Hesychast

While Elder Joseph didn't write extensively on ecumenism specifically, his teachings on maintaining Orthodox purity and not compromising with error are relevant:

**"When you want to learn the will of God, abandon your own will completely along with every other thought or plan; and, with much humility, ask God in prayer for His understanding."**[20]

## Conclusion

These Orthodox saints, theologians, and elders consistently condemned ecumenism as:

- A **heresy** or **"pan-heresy"** that encompasses all other errors
- A **betrayal of Christ** and His Church
- A **mixture of truth and falsehood** that obscures Orthodox truth
- A **worldly movement** that compromises eternal salvation for temporal unity
- A **deception** that leads souls away from the one true Church

Their warnings emphasize that true Christian unity can only come through **repentance** and **conversion to Orthodoxy**, not through compromising Orthodox truth or treating all denominations as equally valid paths to salvation.
