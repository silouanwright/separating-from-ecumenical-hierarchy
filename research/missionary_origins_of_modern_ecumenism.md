Preface
The impact of the contemporary ecumenical movement on the life of the
Church in the 20th century has been immense. Orthodox involvement has
steadily increased over the years and is now generally accepted as a given by
many. Still, many questions remain unanswered or unasked. How did the
modern ecumenical movement begin? What were the causes, motivations,
and reasons for its development? Why and how did the Orthodox first
become involved? Did the movement for Christian unity begin with the 1920
Encyclical “Unto the Churches of Christ Everywhere” and arise out of a
search for “unity in truth” and doctrinal agreement, as if often maintained?
In this lecture, I have attempted to give answers to these questions, basing
my analysis on authoritative sources of ecumenical history, so that we might
be brought face-to-face with the historical record. If each of us individually,
and the Church as a whole, is to see the question of ecumenism holistically
and catholically, and not narrowly or colored by ulterior motivations, it is
essential that we become familiar with the Evangelical Protestant roots of
ecumenism and how these played a role in our own involvement. Doing so
will contribute to the inauguration of a long-needed inter-Orthodox dialogue,
a dialogue with the potential to lead to that longed-for unity in our approach
to the heterodox and the question of ecumenism.
It is my hope and prayer that this small offering will contribute
substantially toward this blessed desire: the unity of the Orthodox, for which
Christ prayed (Jn. 17:21-23), for the mission of imparting salvation to the
world.

INTRODUCTION
The Historical Record and the Ecclesiological Framework of
Ecumenism
Among many Orthodox Christians today it is generally accepted that the
contemporary Ecumenical Movement began with the Patriarchal Encyclical
of 1920 “Unto the Churches of Christ Everywhere.
” Furthermore, it is
generally believed that the movement for Christian unity arose out of a search
for “unity in truth” and doctrinal agreement. It will, thus, come as a surprise
to many to discover that the historical record disproves both of these
assertions beyond a shadow of a doubt.
History shows that the contemporary Ecumenical Movement has its roots
in the Protestant missionary movement of the 19th century and its inspiration
in the desire of Evangelical Protestants to achieve a “unity in fellowship”
amongst themselves for greater success in the mission field. Willem
Saayman, a Protestant scholar of missiology, begins his study on mission and
unity with the following words: “The ecumenical movement does not derive
simply from a passion for unity; it sprang from a passion for unity that is
completely fused in mission.
”1 The union of mission and ecumenism,
however, was not something arrived at quickly or painlessly for the
Protestant world. It grew slowly in the soil of global confessional alliances
and comity2 agreements among the Protestants in the second half of the 19th
century, and continued in the international student movements and
missionary conferences, becoming a new paradigm of ecclesiastical unity –
for the conversion of the world. It became, from 1910 onwards, the basis
upon which the Ecumenical Movement was built.
3
It is, thus, apparent that, long before the 1920 encyclical was sent out and
the Orthodox entered into the discussion, the presuppositions and parameters
of encounter were set and they did not, even in the slightest, reflect or even
acknowledge Orthodox ecclesiological principles.
4 The ecclesiological
framework in which the ecumenical movement was forged, formed,
developed and exists to this day is, with slight adjustments, the product of
19th century Evangelicalism.
In this paper we will examine this “evangelical ecclesiology,
” the “pre-
history” of ecumenism, its origins in Protestant mission, and the historical
and theological context into which the Orthodox entered the ecumenical
movement. In particular, we will stop at five major milestones through which
ecumenism passed on its way to Orthodox involvement.
William Carey, one of the chief pioneers of Evangelical missions.
MILESTONE ONE
The Protestant Missionary Movement of the 19th Century
We begin our journey with the Great Evangelical Awakenings. In order to
correctly asses the modern Ecumenical Movement as a whole, and the World
Missionary Conferences in particular, it is essential to understand the
foundational role played by the “great revivals” of the 19th century which
swept across Europe and North America. According to the historian James
Hastings Nichols, by the end of the eighteenth century the Reformed
confessions had sunk to their lowest ebb in terms of “religious vitality” and
were badly in need of a spiritual recovery.
5 This recovery came with the
Evangelical Awakening, the origins of which can be traced to the Pietist
movement in Germany, the rise of Methodism in Great Britain, and the Great
Awakening on the American frontier.
6 It was a movement which, although
finding its chief stimulus in British Evangelicalism, can be characterized as
transnational, passing from country to country.
7 Whatever its origins,
however, its spirit and its underlying motives were always the same: a
passion for evangelism. Out of this passion came into being societies,
voluntary movements, and organizations in which Protestants of different
nations and denominations “banded themselves together to win the world for
Christ.
”8
Thus, it was that “the missionary movement came out of the evangelical
awakening.
”9 The missionary movement, however, did not of course exist in
a vacuum, but was heavily conditioned by historic circumstances. The dream
of converting the heathen across the globe was stimulated by, and came on
the heels of, colonial expansion and conquest and thus was largely dependent
upon the Western powers, especially Great Britain and America, for its
practical implementation. In the marriage of mission and colonialism,
therefore, in addition to the passion for “Christianizing” the world there was
added the task of “civilizing” it.
Samuel Worcester
Samuel Worcester of the American wing of Foreign Missions described
his society’s objective as “civilizing and christianizing”
– in that order: “To
make the whole tribe English in their language, civilized in their habits, and
Christian in their religion: this is the present plan.
”10
David Livingstone
If, however,
“christianizing” was inseparable from “civilizing” for the
American Protestant missionary, Christianity without commerce was unlikely
for the British Protestant. In 1856 the explorer-missionary David Livingstone
electrified the British nation with tales of his adventurous travels across
Africa, thereby launching that alliance for “commerce, civilization, and
Christianity” which was to characterize British Protestant missions in the
colonial era. By cultivating the native inclination for trade, he claimed that
“the advantages that might be derived in a commercial point of view are
incalculable; nor should we lose sight of the inestimable blessings it is in our
power to bestow upon the unenlightened African, by giving him the light of
Christianity. Those two pioneers of civilization – Christianity and
commerce – should ever be inseparable.
”11
Commercial opportunities alone, however, certainly would not have been
sufficient to galvanize what Protestant historians like to call the “greatest
geographic expansion of the Faith that had yet been seen.
”12 The rapid
development of the missionary spirit and missionary organizations among
evangelicals was mainly responsible for, what Rufus Anderson described as,
“the avowed expectation and purpose – for the first time since the apostolic
age – of laboring for the conversion of the whole heathen world.
”13
Behind the explosion in missions lies the desire of Protestants to break
out of their conventional, regimented way of life and discover “what is
beyond the frontiers of normal experience.
”14 The optimism, idealism and
dreaminess15 which characterized mid-century mission was not, however,
limited to a few visionaries or totally unfounded, but was rather based upon
impressive signs of growth in activity and resources. Thus it was that by the
turn of the century, John Mott, the “spokesman for global missions among
the Protestants,
”16 dared to speak of “the evangelization of the world in this
generation.
”17 One the one hand, Mott pointed to the growth of the
missionary societies. At the beginning of the nineteenth century there were
six Protestant missionary organizations. By the end of the century there were
537. On the other hand, he saw an “unparalleled opportunity” in the control
which Western rulers had over the inhabitants of one-third of the
“unevangelized world”:18
“[I]t seems entirely possible,
” he wrote,
“to fill the earth with the knowledge of Christ before
the present generation passes away… Now steam and electricity have brought the world
together. The Church of God is in the ascendant. She has well within her control the power,
the wealth, and the learning of the world.
”19
This global vision of mission was, in two important ways, to set the stage
for the “ecumenical century” to follow. Firstly, it took Protestantism out of its
isolation in the West and brought it face to face both with cultures, peoples
and faiths around the world and with its own divisions reflected in the
denominational chaos which was transplanted to the mission field. In this
respect, it is quite telling that the most outspoken proponents of ecumenism
after the turn of the century were the leaders of the newly-planted missions of
China and India. The children of division were calling their fathers to give
account.
Secondly, the missionary movement often went hand in hand with
colonial and economic expansion. In this way, the worldwide spread of
Protestantism is seen to be an important factor in the first stages of the
process of globalization,
20 which has been built upon the common language
and culture of the Protestant West.
21
Thus, the Protestant missionary enterprise served as the spring board of
the ecumenical movement and prepared the ground for the arrival of the
“ecumenical century” and the move from a missionary to an “ecumenical
ecclesiology.

MILESTONE TWO
The Evangelical Ecclesiology: The Invisible Church
In the heady atmosphere of missionary expectation and aspiration, then, the
ground was readied for the seed of ecumenism to be planted. The spirit of
unity was rising upon the divided Protestant world like a phoenix out of the
ashes. One historian describes the evangelical movement’s unifying effects
thus:
“In its first exhilarating phase, the suddenness of the awakening, the sense of millennial
expectation it aroused, the freshness of the evangelical experience, the revival movement, all
served to create a powerful sense of fraternity among those who were awakened. Armenians
and Calvinists, Churchmen and Dissenters, achieved an unprecedented level of unity.
”22
This sense of fraternity was not limited to feelings alone, but gave itself
expression institutionally, as well. London, in 1846, was the setting for the
coming into being of a “new thing” in Church history –
“a definite
organization for the expression of unity amongst Christian individuals
belonging to different Churches, namely, the Evangelical Alliance.
”23 Eight
hundred Evangelical leaders belonging to no less than fifty-two Protestant
denominations were in attendance. Hailed “as if it were the millennium,
” it is
claimed that here “the reality of Christian unity had at last found corporate
expression.
”24
The Evangelical Alliance was an organization which “aimed at making
the ‘Invisible Church visible,
’” “that the world may know.
”25 In large part
through the Alliance Evangelicals “had learnt to feel themselves one in
Christ, across national and ecclesiastical boundaries, had banded themselves
together in voluntary societies, and had come to look upon co-operation with
each other in the service of their Lord as a normal and joyful part of the
Christian life.
”26
United in the evangelical experience through the missionary societies, in
spite of or in indifference to dogmatic differences, the unity of the
evangelicals can rightly said to be one of the first expressions of the
contemporary ecumenical spirit.
27 They realized that, as T.V. Philip has
written,
“they shared an experience that marked them off decisively from all
others and gathered them together in the fellowship of an invisible church of
Christ to which all ‘vital’ Christians belonged. The evangelical experience
was not a matter of theological reflection, but rather a general experiential
crisis… For them, if the theologies could divide, experience could unite.
”28
The passion for evangelism gave rise to the passion for unity, expressed
both on the practical level, toward greater missionary success, and on the
theoretical level, in the evangelical conception of the church as being
invisible and of unity as being a matter of the heart; spiritual not organic.
29
The spread and acceptance of this conception of the church throughout and
eventually beyond evangelical circles was made possible by the missionary
society – an organization at once non-ecclesial and super-ecclesial.
Protestant historian Ruth Rouse has this to say about the evangelical
missionary societies:
“They were not ecumenical in objective…but…they were ecumenical in result. . . they
created a consciousness of unity, a “sense of togetherness” amongst Christians of different
Churches. Though rarely formulated, the fundamental conception of Christian unity which lay
beneath their common striving was that all true Christians share the life in Christ, that they
are one by virtue of that sharing, and that this oneness is the essential Christian unity.
”30
A “new thing” had appeared in Christian history: an invisible “church”
simultaneously within and above the churches. Evangelicals lived a double
existence: they were respectable and loyal members of the national church
but they also knew in their hearts that they shared a common faith and
experience with other Evangelicals “that transcended denominational
boundaries and theological parties.
”31 For the Evangelicals, whose principle
task was to preach the Gospel to the heathen, the greatest evil of the time was
“denominational bigotry.
” Hence, when in 1795 the London Missionary
Society was founded, which was started as a union effort of
Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Methodists, and Anglicans, it was hailed
as “the funeral of bigotry.
”32
Out of the common evangelical experience, then, an “evangelical
ecclesiology” had appeared founded upon the watchword: “if theologies can
divide, experience can unite.
”
By way of the evangelical societies and experience, denominational walls
were circumvented and Christian unity came to be based on subjective
experience, divorced from theological truth. This meant that divisions of a
doctrinal or ecclesiological nature were to be overlooked for the sake of an
unclear ideal of “Christianity”
. In this way the unity of theology and
experience, life and truth, were rent asunder, and the door was flung open to
the creation of a church within and transcending the churches – a kind of
super, but invisible, church, made up of all ‘vital’ Christians, possessing
special traits, experiences and knowledge.
When, however, life and faith, experience and theology are separated,
theology is not long thereafter discarded and disdained, first as something
dead and unessential, then as something annoying and obstructive. Hence, in
the Protestant world, insisting on certain aspects of ecclesiology and church
life and order become akin to “bigotry”
. The Orthodox Christian does not,
however, insist on particular points of doctrine out of some small-minded,
passionate bigotry, but precisely because they know where indifference or
disdain for the truth of Christ and His Church lead – to the kind of dissolution
and division which characterize the Protestant world and has led them to the
dead-end of secularization.
MILESTONE THREE
The Y.M.C.A and Student Christian Movements: The Inspiration
of the Ecumenical Generation
Toward the end of the century33 there arose two movements which “were
destined perhaps more than any other results of the Evangelical Awakening
to prepare for and affect the course of the modern ecumenical movement.
”34
These movements were the Young Men’s Christian Association (Y.M.C.A.)
and the Student Christian Movement (SCM). The central role these
organizations played in the development of ecumenism is obvious when one
considers that four-fifths of those assembled on the platform at World
Council of Churches founding assembly owed their “ecumenical inspiration”
to these student groups.
35
The Chairman and Secretaries of the International Committee of the Young Men’s Christian
Associations, September 1893.
While most leaders of the student movements were indifferent to
ecclesiastical questions and to the relations of the churches, they were
nevertheless evangelical, missionary and consciously international. They
developed their movements into world organizations. They turned toward the
East and Africa and intentionally sought out and trained Oriental leaders.
They realized the strategic importance of the student movement and enabled
it to serve the ecumenical future.
By 1895 the Student Christian Movements of many lands had already
coalesced in the World’s Student Christian Federation. John Mott, the
“symbol and prophet” of the transition from evangelicalism to ecumenism
and the man responsible for the Federation, wrote the following, days after its
founding:
“The Federation will … unite in spirit the students of the world [and] in doing this it will be
achieving a yet more significant result – the hastening of the answer to our Lord’s prayer,
‘that they all may be one’
… Surely there has been no more hopeful development towards a
real spiritual union of Christendom than the … Federation, which unites in common purpose
and work the coming leaders of the Church and State in all lands.
”36
John R. Mott c. 1905
It was John Mott, who would also go on to play the central and pivotal
role in bringing the Orthodox Church into the ecumenical movement.
37 Due
to Mott’s persistence and astuteness, sixteen years later, in 1911, the
Constantinople Conference of the Federation was held, with its “epoch-
making representation of the Eastern Churches.
”38 Mott had been working
hard to bring the Orthodox into the Student Movement, traveling throughout
the Balkans and Russia39
, such that by 1911 he became convinced that
cooperation with the Orthodox was possible. He quoted the words of an early
acquaintance and supporter of the SCM, Germanos Strenopoulos,
Metropolitan of Thyateira and Exarch of Western Europe for the Ecumenical
Patriarchate, in support of his optimism: “Where hearts are united, the
resistance of the head will diminish. It was the looseness of the bonds of love,
which brought the divisions of Christianity.
”40
Ruth Rouse, Mott’s co-worker and ecumenical historian, asks: “What was
the new ecumenical idea which the Student Christian Movement was
destined to introduce to the Church?” It was the “idea of a new type of
Christian organization, a new conception of the basis on which Christians
belonging to different Churches might unite to win the world for Christ – on
an ‘interdenominational’ rather than an ‘undenominational’ basis.
”41 It was a
movement which “started with the belief that they shared the life in Christ
with fellow-believers” and recognized the believers’ “allegiance to the
various Christian Bodies into which”
– as they thought –
“the Body of Christ
is divided.
”42
The Student Christian Movements became the link that would carry the
Evangelical ecclesiology beyond the narrow confines of Evangelicalism.
Non-doctrinal, non-ecclesial, non-sacramental, the student movements,
ironically, at once signaled the disintegration of the Western confessions and
their reintegration, but in a non-ecclesial way. They sought catholicity, but
only horizontally, not vertically, not diachronically.
It was through such experiences, then, that by the eve of the Edinburgh
conference in 1910 such early Orthodox ecumenical enthusiasts as
Metropolitan Germanos Strenopoulos were prepared to take their place at the
table of the modern ecumenical movement.
43
Strenopoulos’ stance, however, was not the only one possible. There were
other Orthodox who rejected Mott’s call to unity and communion precisely
on the grounds that those issuing it were ignoring the ever-present unity and
communion of the Church. One such renowned Orthodox theologian and
hierarch was the New Hieromartyr Hilarion (Troitsky). After one of John
Mott’s visits to Russia, he wrote the following:
“People who deny the Church constantly speak about “evangelical principles,
” about
evangelical teaching; but Christianity as life is completely alien to them . . . Protestantism has
killed the general Church life, about which the Lord Jesus Christ prayed in that first sacred
”
prayer.
The Holy Hieromartyr then addressed the Student Movement in
particular:
“While I was listening to the lecture on “The International Christian Student Union,
” my heart
was filled with sadness and sorrow. How many sincere people who are thirsty for God, thirsty
for life, are perishing of hunger and being fed the suckle of some overseas student union. Can
it be that they do not know how to make use of the abundant bread in the home of the
heavenly Father, in the Orthodox Church? It is necessary only to forget all the “federative
bases,
” to freely give oneself up to complete obedience to the Orthodox Church and to adhere
to the completeness of Church life, to the life of the body of Christ [in order to make use of
these abundant breads].
”44
The judgment of Saint Hilarion was not shared by those Orthodox who
rushed to unite with the heterodox in fellowship without first uniting in the
Truth and the Church. But there is one more step that the Protestant world
must take before more Orthodox will join their “unity in fellowship”: the
First World Mission Conference in Edinburgh.
The First World Mission Conference, Edinburgh, Scotland,
“the cradle of modern ecumenism”
.
MILESTONE FOUR
Edinburgh 1910: The Cradle of Modern Ecumenism
The International Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh in 1910 has been
hailed by historians as a “watershed event in ecumenical cooperation,
”45 “one
of the great landmarks in the history of the Church”46 and “the cradle of
modern ecumenism.
”47 Edinburgh was the first conference which sought to
be inclusive of a wide range of Protestant confessions, not just Evangelicals.
“Out of it grew the movements which were to merge to form the World
Council of Churches in 1948, and the International Missionary Council,
which became the mission and evangelism arm of the WCC in 1961.
Convinced that God was calling them to world evangelization, the Edinburgh
delegates saw church divisions as a mission weakness and unity in mission as
a divine imperative.
”48
When the call was finally sent out to come to Edinburgh,
“to spend and
be spent” in the ecumenical movement, Evangelical leadership had “been
accustomed all along to enter into common conference and co-operation with
[their] separated brethren.
”49 John Mott, who was a Methodist, a layman and
“a spiritual child of the revival movement,
” was “the mastermind of the
gathering.
”50 Together with Joseph H. Oldham, also a child of the student and
missionary movements, Mott fashioned the Edinburgh assembly into a
training ground for ecumenical leadership, such that few if any of the
attendees “escaped the contagion of its spirit.
”51
John Mott, c 1930
Although ecclesiastical or doctrinal questions were formally off-limits
and concern was directed to strategy and co-operation in mission, the need
for unity in the mission field permeated the entire conference. The
missionaries were “literally plaintive in their appeal that the church of Christ
re-establish her long lost unity.
”52 Fear of the rise and independence of the
mission churches and their breaking away from the western traditions and
western control led the missionary societies into co-operation and unity.
53
Lord Balfour, former secretary for Scotland in the British Cabinet,
acknowledged the influence of the young churches’ pleas when he asserted
that “a unity begun on the mission field may extend its influence and react
upon us at home and throughout the older civilizations.
”54 And Episcopalian
Bishop Brent, who would soon emerge as the leader of the Faith and Order
movement, expressed the urgency of the crisis: “we missionaries have
moments of deep depression when the consciousness sweeps over us that it is
little short of absurd to try to bring into the Church of Christ the great nations
of the Far East unless we can present an undivided front.
”55
Time honors Bishop Brent
Bishop Brent’s despair was not unfounded. Within 19th century
Protestantism the separation between church and mission was so great that
“the only reality for Christians in the mission field, was mission,
” such that
they were not even conscious of belonging to a church.
56 In Edinburgh,
however, the church, at least theoretically, made its appearance: “the world
mission of Christianity had become church-centric” and the foreign mission
as an administrative entity was about to drop into irrelevance.
57 The move
from para-church to inter-church had begun and in this the modern
ecumenical movement was born.
The push for mission had revealed division, and division was a scandal
which the mission churches, under the pressure of nationalism, reacted
against. Their reaction was the spark which ignited ecumenism in the home
churches – an ecumenism characterized by dogmatic minimalism and “unity
in fellowship.
” This chain of reactions led to the Edinburgh assembly, which,
under the leadership of John Mott, marks the culmination of the purely
Evangelical offering and the real institutional beginning of the transition from
an evangelical to an “ecumenical ecclesiology” for Christianity.
A “united and renewed church” outfitted for a universal mission and
service, moving beyond its geographic and dogmatic borders, uniting the
entire “oikumene” “in fellowship”: this is the new dream that stirred men into
performing the incredible drama of Edinburgh and the modern ecumenical
movement. It is a dream with “eschatological implications,
” and they are
quite correct who see in it a strange inversion of the Christian Church which
had hitherto existed.
At Edinburgh the walls of doctrine began to fall and in their place were
erected the belief that differences would be transcended without being
surrendered.
58 After Edinburgh, however, the Orthodox would soon enter the
scene and be forced to work within such a framework and mindset that did
not allow for Orthodox ecclesiological presuppositions.

MILESTONE FIVE
Widening the Notion of the Church: The 1920 Encyclical and Early
Orthodox Participation
As we have seen, within the first decade of the 20th century John Mott and his
co-workers had canvassed hard for Orthodox involvement in the Protestant
movement for “unity in fellowship.
” The fruit of their work was shown first
of all in the “epoch-making” Constantinople assembly of the W.C.S.F. in
1911, where Metropolitan Germanos encountered the fresh enthusiasm of the
Edinburgh conference in such men as John Mott, Swedish Archbishop
Nathan Söderblom and other pioneers of the ecumenical movement.
59 The
Edinburgh nucleus would thereafter span out to create a variety of venues
which were designed, in part, to open up the movement to the East and
South: J.H. Oldham continued the work of the World Missionary Conference;
Bishop Brent spearheaded the Faith and Order movement; Nathan Söderblom
championed the Life and Work movement, and so on.
It was in the midst of these developments and under the shadow of their
influence that Germanos Strenopoulos and others composed the historic text
that would become the 1920 Encyclical of the Ecumenical Patriarchate,
“Unto the Churches of Christ Everywhere.
”60
L-R: Metropolitan Germanos, Patriarch Photios of Alexandria and Nathan Söderblom
Passing over a number of aspects of the Encyclical which have been
widely disputed elsewhere, we will focus on only one historical and
theological detail of great importance. In the Encyclical a new consideration
was being urged upon the churches,
“that they should no more consider one
another as strangers and foreigners, but as relatives, and as being a part of the
household of Christ and ‘fellow heirs, members of the same body and
partakers of the promise of God in Christ’ (Eph. 3:6).
”61
In commenting on this passage in 1929, Metropolitan Germanos himself,
the encyclical’s main author, interprets it thus:
“How wide the conception is which the Encyclical teaches at this point becomes clear in that
it widens the notion of the relationships between the members of a single church – as
members of one body according to St. Paul’s wonderful teaching – so as to apply it to the
relationships between several churches.
”62
The importance of this interpretation of the encyclical by its main author
and the architect of the Patriarchate’s ecumenical involvement cannot be
underestimated. Here is the cornerstone of the ecumenical policy of the
Patriarchate and the key point of synchronization with the developing
“ecumenical ecclesiology” of the Protestants.
In widening the notion of the church to include bodies neither
ecclesiastically, sacramentally, or dogmatically in communion with the
Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Germanos is in perfect harmony both with
the foregoing “evangelical ecclesiology” which speaks of a “fellowship of an
invisible church of Christ to which all ‘vital’ Christians belonged,
” as well as
the succeeding “ecumenical ecclesiology” which, although quite similar in its
admission of an existing invisible “mystical” Body of Christ, seeks a manifest
unity in Christ.
63
International Missionary Conference 1920
Metropolitan Germanos’ radical reinterpretation and “broadening” of St.
Paul’s teaching concerning the Body of Christ was not something limited to
him, but, as would be natural in the overwhelmingly Protestant setting of the
movement’s gatherings, such ecclesiological “broad mindedness” permeated
the entire atmosphere of ecumenical engagement.
64 This led to the adoption
by Orthodox ecumenists – consciously or unconsciously – of Protestant
ecclesiological attitudes.
Indeed, already in 1920, at the very first gathering at which Orthodox
representatives were present, it was the Orthodox who would first propose
the notion of cooperation in mission. In the name of the Orthodox Church,
Professor Alivisatos of Athens presented a program for a creation of a
League of Churches which included, as its first point,
“To stop proselytizing
between the Christian churches, and to promote mutual understanding
between them for Christian missions among non-Christian peoples.
”65

From the outset of ecumenical involvement, then, Orthodox
representatives followed their Protestant forerunners closely in connecting
ecumenism to mission and adopting that cornerstone principle of Protestant
ecumenism – comity (non-proselytism) agreements and mutual support in
mission. That which today still seems unbelievable to most Orthodox
Christians – collaboration in mission with the heterodox – was never a
problem for Orthodox ecumenists. Indeed, it was one of the Patriarchate’s
motivating factors for involvement in the first place.
Seven years later, in 1927 at the Faith and Order conference in Lausanne,
the declaration of the Orthodox included sentiments quite similar to those
we’ve seen expressed by Protestants. The delegates declared “that, although
divided by dogmatic differences, we are one with our brethren here in faith in
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
”66 Similarly, ten years later in Edinburgh,
Metropolitan Germanos again read a statement by Orthodox representatives
which, after noting certain Orthodox views, nevertheless included a decidedly
Protestant ecclesiological outlook: “Brethren!…With you we bewail the
rending asunder of the seamless robe of Christ. We desire, as you, that the
members of the one Body of Christ may again be reunited…
”67
In addition to this separate statement at the Edinburgh conference, the
Orthodox also joined in adopting the “Question of Affirmation of union in
allegiance to our Lord Jesus Christ in view of the world-situation.
” It reads,
in part:
“We are one in faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the incarnate Word of God…This unity does
not consist in the agreement of our minds or the consent of our wills. It is founded in Jesus
Christ Himself, Who lived, died and rose again to bring us to the Father, and Who through the
Holy Sprit dwells in His Church. . . Our unity is of heart and spirit. We are divided in the
outward forms of our life in Christ, because we understand differently His will for His
Church. . .We know that our witness is weakened by our divisions. Yet we are one in Christ
and in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
”68
In making such statements, the Orthodox representatives were in effect
acknowledging the de facto inclusive “ecumenical ecclesiology” inherent to
the movement. Indeed, from the outset of Orthodox participation in 1920,
Metropolitan Germanos’ “widened notion of the church” placed the Orthodox
in perfect harmony with the tenor of the movement and thereby
acknowledged it, in a way, as “an ontologically new phenomenon in
Christian history requiring a deep rethinking and re-evaluation of Orthodox
ecclesiology as shaped in the ‘non-ecumenical’ era.

The 1920 Encyclical has been hailed as a prophetic and “ground-
breaking” event which not only ushered the Orthodox into the Ecumenical
Movement but was largely responsible for the movement itself. This
contention, however, is not proven out by the preceding string of historical
events. Rather, the encyclical appears to be a reaction and a departure: a
reaction to political and world events70 and a departure from the hitherto
cautious approach based upon the experience of the Orthodox and the
Church’s ancient canons.
71 Yet, it was more than just a departure; it
represented a “remarkable change of mind.
”72 With the encyclical, the
Patriarchate did not simple change its stance vis-à-vis the heterodox
confessions, it changed its understanding of the Orthodox Church itself.
First Executive Committee Meeting of the World Council of Churches, Bossey, 1949: T.C. Luke, Pastor
Boegner, Metropolitan Germanos, and W.A. Visser Hooft
Conclusion
As it pertains to the theological approach to the issue, from that time until
today not much has changed in the realm of official, conciliar Orthodox
theology. There has been no indication of previous errors; no official
corrective synodical judgment has been made – except for those decisions
which are considered schismatic and marginal.
On the contrary, confusion and double-talk reign and the Orthodox
ecumenists would like us to view the World Council of Churches (WCC) as a
worldwide humanitarian and peace-making platform for dialogue, from
which we must not be absent “lest we become isolated.
” The truth is,
however, that the WCC has never ceased to be driven by the Evangelical
Protestant dream of a united and worldwide mission irrespective of dogmatic
peculiarities and sensitivities – something which perhaps is understandable
for the Protestants, with the minor dogmatic differences which usually exist
between them, but not for the Orthodox. For the Orthodox the very basis for
involvement – recognizing a unity in Christ and the Church with the
heterodox – nullifies the very reason for involvement, namely, to instill in the
heterodox “a good uneasiness” and sense of separation from the Church.
73
That which makes their dream even more dangerous, however, is that today
the World Council of Churches advertises its failing as an advantage and
begins to honor and “celebrate” the spiritual “distinctiveness” and dogmatic
“differences” of its members instead of being aggrieved over them and
attempt to overcome them.
Central Committee Meeting of the World Council of Churches, Toronto, 1950: L-R: Professor Baillie,
Metropolitan Germanos, John Mott, Pastor Boegner, M. Niemoller, and W.A. Visser Hooft
If we add to all of this the pre-existing estrangement of many members of
the WCC from the authentic faith and ethos of the Gospel, as well as its
increasingly visible approach to and reconciliation with the religions of the
world, glimmers of the nightmare of the Apocalypse are cast upon the
globalized mission dream of Ecumenism, a worldwide mission without
Christ, ready to accept and preach the Antichrist.
The way out of the dead end of this ecumenistic ecclesiology and
mission – which has done more to split the Orthodox Church than unite Her –
is the path of Orthodox mission.
If Protestant mission led us into ecumenism, Orthodox mission will lead
us out: tried and tested apostolic and patristic mission, true, uncompromising,
ascetic, otherworldly, and sacrificial, which aims at heavenly, not temporal,
ends. Mission in the spirit and tradition of Apostles Peter and Paul, Ss. Cyril
and Methodios, St. Stephen of Perm, St. Kosmas Aitolos, St. Innocent of
Alaska, and, in our own times, Blessed Father Cosmas of Grigoriou and Zaire
and the ever-memorable Bishop Nectarios of Madagascar.
To such Orthodox witness there can be no objection on the part of
anyone. Such an Orthodox witness can unite all Orthodox in the realization of
an authentic catholic vision of mission, where we all, according to the words
of the Apostle Peter, will be ready always to give an answer to every man
that asketh a reason of the hope that is in you (1 Peter 3:15).
With such a spiritual and authentically ecclesiastical Mission we will be
able to call all – heterodox and all religious believers – to unity in truth and
into the “one body, and one Spirit… one Lord, one faith, one baptism” (Eph.
4:5) in the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, which is in truth the
very Body of the Resurrected Lord Jesus Christ.
Short of this repentance, this return to “the first works”
, the Lord “will
come… quickly, and will remove [the] candlestick out of his place” (Rev.
2:5) and our house will be left desolate.
“Wherefore let him that thinketh he
standeth take heed lest he fall” (I Cor. 10:12).
May God bring us back to our “first love” (Rev. 2:4), for our sake and the
salvation of the world.
Rev. R. Spartas and Rev. Obadias, Founders of the “African Greek Orthodox Church” in Uganda
(1929)
These men were among those Africans who sought out of their own volition
and zeal the Orthodox Church, living as much as possible according to the
Orthodox Church’s teachings and practices, without, however, being first
sought out by missionaries of the Church.
For,
“of a truth … God is no respecter of persons” (Acts 10:34) but “is able
of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham (Mat. 3:9).
Notes
Introduction
1. 2. Saayman, Willem A., 1984. Unity and Mission, Pretoria: University of South Africa (emphasis
mine). That the contemporary ecumenical movement has its immediate origins in the 19th century
Protestant missionary movement is generally accepted among historians.
“The contemporary
search for the unity of the church was initiated within the framework of the mission endeavour.
The missionaries were among the first to look for ways and styles of witness in unity, recognizing
that the scandal of Christian divisions and denominational rivalries hindered greatly the impact of
their message.
” Mission and Evangelism in Unity Today, Preparatory Paper No 1 for the WCME
conference in Athens, May 2005. See also chapters 7 and 8 in A History of the Ecumenical
Movement, 1517-1968, Edited by Routh Rouse and Stephen C. Neil, WCC, Geneva, fourth edition,
1993. Fr. George Tsetsis appears to hold a different opinion in his article The Orthodox in the
Ecumenical Movement, where he states: “Ecumenism both as a theological challenge and as an
expression of Orthodox willingness for Christian unity was experienced in our Church during the
1st, 5th, 11th and 16th centuries. It re-emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century when the
Ecumenical Patriarchate took its afore-mentioned initiative [the 1920 encyclical – ed.], in order to
foster cooperation and promote unity” (emphasis mine).
In this context, comity refers to the avoidance of proselytizing members of another religious
denomination.

But, then again, as we will show further on, neither did those Orthodox who first took part in the
movement call for or even advance such principles as a pre-requisite for participation.

15. J.H. Nichols writes characteristically: “[William] Carey, perhaps the chief pioneer of Evangelical
missions, derived part of his inspiration from reading of the work done among the Indians in
Colonial America by John Eliot and David Brainerd. This reading, and his reading of the Voyages
of Captain Cook combined to inspire his dream of a mission to all humanity.

division.

Milestone Three: The Y.M.C.A and Student Christian Movements: The Inspiration of the
Ecumenical Generation
33. Actually, the Y.M.C.A. was founded in the 1840’s and the SCM in 1895. The missionary wing of
the Student Christian Movement was the Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions.
34. A History of the Ecumenical Movement, p. 327. Indeed, the Y.M.C.A. was ecumenical from its
very founding. When young George Williams was discussing the founding of the organization with
three other young men, he exclaimed: “Here we are, an Episcopalian, a Methodist, a Baptist, and a
Congregationalist – four believers but a single faith in Christ. Forward together!” Ibid.
35. Leaders who began their ecumenical career as members or officers in some S.C.M. or were “won
for ecumenism” by some contact with the movement include: John R. Mott, Robert Wilder, Nathan
Söderblom, W.A. Visser’t Hooft, J.H. Oldham, Tissington Tatlow, Zoë Fairfield, William Temple,
William Paton, Marc Boegner, Suzanne de Diétrich, Friedrich Wilhelm Siegmund-Schultze, Hanns
Lilje, V.S. Azariah, David Yui, T.Z. Koo, Michi Kawai, Germanos Strenopoulos of Thyateira
(Metropolitan Exarch), Stefan Zankov.
36. A History of the Ecumenical Movement, p. 341.
37. Ruth Rouse puts it this way: “He steadily cultivated relationships not only with all Protestant
Churches but also with the ancient Churches of the East, and did much to draw them into the
ecumenical movement. A remarkable incident in this phase of his activities was when in 1913 he,
an American Methodist layman, chaired the first conference on reunion amongst the different
branches of the Syrian Church in India.

something of this “contagion of the spirit” felt by the attendees thus: “As one read the reports one
seemed to be looking into the great workshop of history. One saw the forces that were making
nations, that were making religions, and those who had eyes to see saw the forming of something
very vast, very formidable, and full of promise.

allegiances found that uninhibited discussions could be carried on in an atmosphere of common
worship, that in a fellowship knit together and deepened by prayer conscientiously-held differences
could be clearly stated and transcended without surrender, and that the unity of Christ’s Church in
the midst of differences could be clearly felt.
”
Milestone Five: Widening the Notion of the Church: The 1920 Encyclical and Early Orthodox
Participation
59. Visser’t Hooft, W.A., The Genesis and Formation of the World Council of Churches (WCC:
Geneva 1982), p. 2.
60. Ibid., p. 2. W.A. Visser’t Hooft writes that Germanos Strenopoulos “is generally supposed to have
written most of the text.
” Likewise that,
“In April 1919, when a delegation of the American
Episcopal Church visited Constantinople to inform the Patriarchate of the plan to hold a World
Conference on Faith and Order, the Metropolitan of Cesaria was able to report on behalf of the
synod that the special committee set up to study ‘the question of the league of the different
churches and of their possible rapprochement’ had already reached its conclusions.
” Visser’t Hooft
sees this as proof of the independent inspiration of the Patriarchate, unrelated to the influence of
the Protestants, and hence confirmation of its divine inspiration. A more sober assessment,
however, and one that Visser’t Hooft himself (curiously) makes reference to elsewhere, leads one
to see the 1920 encyclical as, to a great degree, the fruit of the political instability of the day, and of
the Patriarchate’s desire to emerge from isolation and put an end to the “sheep-steeling” of the
Protestant missionaries. Furthermore, this evaluation of events is supported by the subsequent
development of the Patriarchate’s ecumenical approach amid increased political turmoil and
instability.
61.
“Unto the Churches of Christ Everywhere,
” Encyclical of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, 1920, p. 2.
62. Visser’t Hooft, p. 3 (emphasis mine). He is quoting from Die Eiche, 1929, p. 30.
63. Indeed, Metropolitan Germanos’ intervention could be seen as a bridge uniting the individualistic
ecclesiology of the evangelicals, which focused on a fellowship of individuals in an invisible
church, and the corporate ecclesiology of ecumenism, which focuses on a “fellowship of churches”
and the “manifestation of the Church in its oneness.
” This last phrase is from The Statement on
“The Church, the churches and the World Council of Churches: The ecclesiological significance of
the World Council of Churches,
” IV:2 (emphasis mine). This statement, drafted in part and agreed
to by Orthodox representatives, was received by the Central Committee of the WCC in Toronto in
1950, only two years after the founding of the WCC. The Orthodox have participated under the
terms of this statement ever-since.
64. This is one of the most characteristic marks of ecumenical involvement for the Orthodox: that in
spite, at times, of quite orthodox statements concerning the Church by individual participants, the
very basis for involvement – inclusiveness of that which is incongruous – undermines and
ultimately (if the goal is the building up of the Church through sacramental initiation) renders non-
existent Orthodox witness. Only by severely downgrading or eliminating altogether the importance
of initiation into the life of the Church can one speak of Orthodox witness to the heterodox in the
framework of ecumenical encounter. Ultimately, this translates into denying the existential reality
of the Church itself (the life in Christ), and hence, by extension, the very diachronic presence of the
Incarnate Christ Himself.
65. Visser’t Hooft, p. 6. He is quoting from Faith and Order pamphlet No. 34,
“A Compilation of
Proposals for Christian Unity,
” pp. 78-79.
66. A History of the Ecumenical Movement, p. 656 (emphasis mine).
67. Ibid., p. 659 (emphasis mine).
68. Ibid., pp. 434-5 (emphasis mine).
69. This is how Fr. Alexander Schmemann described the approach of certain Russian theologians to
the phenomenon of the Ecumenical Movement and to the nature of Orthodox participation in it.
Father Schmemann included as representatives of the above mentioned view such Russian émigre
theologians as Sergius Bulgakov, Leo Zander, Nicholas Zernov, and Pavel Evdokimov. See:
Russian Theology 1920-1972, pp. 190-1919, as quoted by Andrew Blane in George Florovsky,
Russian Intellectual and Orthodox Churchman (Saint Vladimir Seminary Press, New York, 1993),
p. 125. See also: Divine Ascent, A Journal of Orthodox Faith, Vol. 1, No. 2, 1997 (Monastery of
St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco, Point Reyes, CA.), p. 43f.
70. The document itself explains that both the inspiration for its writing and the timing of its release
are closely connected to the establishment of the League of Nations (which actually failed
miserably) by political leaders who were “truly applying the spirit of the Gospel and the teaching
of Christ.
” As W.A. Visser’t Hooft observes: “Twice in the Encyclical itself and again in the
covering letter, the League of Nations was mentioned…The covering letter spoke of “the setting up
a league of churches (koinonia ton Ekklesion) on the model of the League of Nations (koinonia ton
Ethnon).
” Furthermore,
“the Encyclical was written in the year 1919, the year in which the dream
dreamt by so many philosophers, the dream of an international order based on law and justice,
seemed at last to become a political reality.
” Visser’t Hooft, p. 4. The picture presented is clearly
one of the Church following the world, both in inspiration and in method, which, under another
name, is called secularization (ekkosmikevsi).
71. In so much as “the synod felt that rapprochement and cooperation between the churches did not
have to wait until doctrinal differences were overcome” (Visser’t Hooft, p. 3), the Patriarchate was
falling in step with the Protestant notion that “unity in fellowship” did not have to wait until “unity
in truth” and that “differences would be transcended without being surrendered.
” Nicholas Zernov,
an enthusiastic supporter of the encyclical’s innovative approach, wrote that “this epistle signified
a departure from the usual cautious attitude of the Orthodox towards the West.
” See: Zernov
Nicholas, The Eastern Churches and the Ecumenical Movement in the Twentieth Century, in A
History of the Ecumenical Movement, p. 654. Likewise, W.A. Visser’t Hooft writes that the
Ecumenical Patriarchate’s encyclical was “an initiative which was without precedent in church
history.
” See: Visser’t Hooft, W.A., p. 1.
72. A History of the Ecumenical Movement, p. 654.
Conclusion
73. The holy and renown Elder Paisios the Athonite puts it this way: “That which is required of every
Orthodox [Christian] is to pass on the good uneasiness to the heterodox, in order that they may
understand that they are in delusion, so as not to falsely be at peace with their thoughts and be
deprived in this life of the rich blessings of Orthodoxy and in the next life the much greater and
eternal blessings of God.
” See: Paisios Agiorite, Elder, With Pain and Love for Contemporary Man
(Souroti, Thessaloniki, Greece: Holy Monastery, of St. John the Theologian, 1999), p. 349 [In
Greek].
