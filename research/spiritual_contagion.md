Her priests also have set at nought my law, and profaned my holy things: they have not distinguished between the holy and profane, nor have they distinguished between the unclean and the clean.

— Ezekiel 22:26

But if it be not possible to go to the church, on account of the unbelievers, thou, Bishop, shalt assemble the faithful in some house, that a godly man may not enter into an assembly of the ungodly. For it is not the place that sanctifieth the man, but the man the place. And if the ungodly possess the place, avoid thou it, because it is profaned by them; for as holy priests sanctify a place, so the profane defile it. If it be not possible to assemble either in the church or in a house, let everyone by himself sing, and read, and pray, or two or three together. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. Let not one of the faithful pray with a catechumen; no, not even privately. For it is not reasonable that he who is initiated should be polluted with one not initiated. Let not one of the godly pray with a heretic; no, not even privately. For what fellowship hath light with darkness? Let believers, man or woman, connected with servants, withdraw themselves from the illicit intercourse, or be rejected from the church".

— Apostolic Constitutions book 8 chapter 34

It was one way or another useful and needed for your authority to remove from the holy altars the one who was defiling them.

Letter of Saint Cyril to Theodosian the younger about Nestorius, ACO 1-1-3, p.81

Being known to be so great a man, therefore, and having thus given answers to those who visited him, he returned again to the inner mountain, and maintained his wonted discipline. And often when people came to him, as he was sitting or walking, as it is written in Daniel , he became dumb, and after a season he resumed the thread of what he had been saying before to the brethren who were with him. And his companions perceived that he was seeing a vision. For often when he was on the mountains he saw what was happening in Egypt, and told it to Serapion the bishop , who was indoors with him, and who saw that Antony was wrapped in a vision. Once as he was sitting and working, he fell, as it were, into a trance, and groaned much at what he saw. Then after a time, having turned to the bystanders with groans and trembling, he prayed, and falling on his knees remained so a long time. And having arisen the old man wept. His companions, therefore, trembling and terrified, desired to learn from him what it was. And they troubled him much, until he was forced to speak. And with many groans he spoke as follows: ‘O, my children, it were better to die before what has appeared in the vision come to pass.’ And when again they asked him, having burst into tears, he said, ‘Wrath is about to seize the Church, and it is on the point of being given up to men who are like senseless beasts. For I saw the table of the Lord’s House, and mules standing around it on all sides in a ring, and kicking the things therein, just like a herd kicks when it leaps in confusion. And you saw,’ said he, ‘how I groaned, for I heard a voice saying, My altar shall be defiled.’ These things the old man saw, and after two years the present inroad of the Arians and the plunder of the churches took place, when they violently carried off the vessels, and made the heathen carry them; and when they forced the heathen from the prisons to join in their services, and in their presence did upon the Table as they would. Then we all understood that these kicks of the mules signified to Antony what the Arians, senselessly like beasts, are now doing. But when he saw this vision, he comforted those with him, saying, ‘Be not downcast, my children; for as the Lord has been angry, so again will He heal us, and the Church shall soon again receive her own order, and shall shine forth as she is wont. And you shall behold the persecuted restored, and wickedness again withdrawn to its own hiding-place, and pious faith speaking boldly in every place with all freedom. Only defile not yourselves with the Arians, for their teaching is not that of the Apostles, but that of demons and their father the devil; yea, rather, it is barren and senseless, and without light understanding, like the senselessness of these mules.’

Juvenal was one of the leaders of the Second Council of Ephesus in 449, being the first to sign it as an ally of Dioscorus. This led to his name being removed from the diptychs of the churches that rejected the council. However he changed his stance at the Council of Chalcedon convened later, condemning the previous council.

— Juvenal of Jerusalem - Wikipedia

Pope Leo I supported removing the names of Dioscorus and Iuvenalis from the diptychs because of their canonical and theological deviations during the second Council of Ephesus.

— PL 54, 914, 923-924

The church of the Romans does not admit Peter, the heretic, who has also been long ago condemned by the holy see, excommunicated, and anathematised. To whom, if there were no other objection, this is sufficient, namely, that having been ordained by heretics, he could not have authority over the orthodox.”

— Evagrius Church history, book III, chapter 21

The Henotikon was widely accepted in the East but proved unacceptable to Rome and the Western church. Consequently, Acacius was deposed (484) by Pope Felix III in an excommunication that was reaffirmed and broadened in 485 to embrace all of Acacius’s accomplices, including a substantial part of the Byzantine hierarchy. The condemnation by Pope Felix precipitated the Acacian Schism, which was not resolved until 519.

But a schism(76) ensued in 484 because Pope Felix III (483-92) condemned the dogmatic decree known as the Henoticon (“Unifier”), which the Emperor Zeno (474-91) had issued in 482 in order to put an end to the disaffection of the monophysites. Unfortunately, however, the Henoticon, though promulgated by Zeno as a compromise which he hoped would satisfy the Chalcedonians and conciliate the monophysites, pleased no one; and its sponsor, Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople (471-89), was excommunicated by Pope Felix (484). In revenge, Acacius struck the name of Felix from the diptychs (the book containing the names of those who were mentioned in the liturgical prayers of the Church of Constantinople), and the resulting “Acacian” schism, as it was called, lasted until 519.

Timothy Patriarch of Constantinople “the name of Severus wanting to add to the diptychs and remove the name of Flavian, was prevented by the people. Because every Orthodox avoided communion with Severus”.

— Theophanis chronographia, 6005

Euphemius immediately with his own hands erased the name of Mongus from the diptychs… and inserted that of Felix of Rome.

— Theophanis chronographia, 5981

Euphemius did not accept Athanasius II (490–497), the successor of Peter Mongus, into communion, since the parties were ranged under differences of opinion.
— Evagrius Church history, book III, chapter 23

Of great significance is also the reference during the election of Patriarch John II of Cappadocia.
“Why do we remain out of communion for so many years? Why do we not have communion? We wish to receive communion from your hands. Come, ascend the pulpit. Come, persuade your people.”

John II was called upon by the clergy, the monks, and the people of the Church of Constantinople to publicly proclaim from the pulpit his unconditional acceptance of the decisions of the Fourth Ecumenical Council (Council of Chalcedon), to inscribe in the diptychs of the throne the names of his orthodox predecessors Euphemius and Macedonius, as well as that of Pope Leo I of Rome, and to anathematize the Monophysite Patriarch of Antioch, Severus.

Despite John II’s rejection of Severus, the faithful insisted with particular intensity:
“You shall not come out unless you anathematize Severus!”
"Cast Severus the Judas out… [Restore] Euphemius and Macedonius to the Church! The synodical letters send now to Rome… Let Euphemius and Macedonius now be restored [to the diptychs]…The four Councils write in the diptychs. Leo, the bishop of Rome, write in the diptychs…Bring the diptychs to the pulpit… bring forth now the diptychs.”

Who patristically is a heretic?
Anyone who understands the Holy Scriptures differently from the way the Holy Spirit guides him, under whose guidance it was written can be called, even before separating himself from the Church, a heretic and originating from the works of the flesh, since he chose the worst way… Everyone is looking for God but not in the right way.

— Saint Jerome Patrologia Latina 26,497 B-C.

Isn’t this Donatism?
The issue with Donatism is the issue with valid or invalid sacraments. The issue with contamination is the desecration of the Holy place and mysteries by heretics. So it’s like two different issues and the 2nd one invalidates the 1st.

If a heretic inside the Church desecrates the sacraments then that means they are valid, else no one would care.

Sacrament validity is directly connected to priesthood and priesthood is not lost magically but only after one is defrocked.
