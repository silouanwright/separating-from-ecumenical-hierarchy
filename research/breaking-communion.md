„Heresy, this frightening sin which comprises
blasphemy against the Holy Spirit within it,
makes the man totally estranged from God
and, estranging him from God,
surrenders him to the power of satan”1
St. Ignaty Brianchaninov
Given that in the last two years the subject of breaking communion with
the ecumenists has become very actual and that this topic is almost
exclusively discussed in the context of the 15th canon of the Synod I-II
of Constantinople (861), there have arisen a lot of opinions and very
diverse interpretations regarding the subject, some of them being even
contradictory. We would like to clarify some questions regarding the
cessation of commemoration and the aforementioned 15th canon,
desiring to reduce as much as possible such divergences and to avoid
harmful interpretations.
The historical context in which the 15th canon was settled
The wrong interpretations of the 15th canon are primarly caused by the
lack of a complete view on the Synod I-II Constantinople, for the
historical context in which this Synod assembled and reached its
decisions is fundamental for the interpretation of the 15th canon.
3 years before this Synod, namely in 858, as a result of a conflict
between the holy patriarch Ignatius and Bardas, brother of the holy
empress Theodora (†866), whom he removed from power, St. Ignatius
was unjustly deposed from the patriarchal throne. In the same year the
great scholar and prominent theologian St. Photius the Great, who was
still a layman, but had already acquired an imposing theological
authority, in the course of just a few days was tonsured into
1 St. Ignaty Brianchaninov – On heresy and schism, c. 3
4
monasticism and went through all ecclesiastical degrees, being
enthroned „forcibly and unwillingly”2 as patriarch on the day of the
Nativity of our Lord in 858.
Then followed a period of trouble in the Church, because many
Christians did not want to recognise the new patriarch due to the way he
had been enthroned. In order to pacify both parties, it was decided on
the one hand that no clerics can break communion with their bishop for
„certain guilt” (personal sins, administrative infringements etc.) until he
has been condemned by a synod (canons 13, 14 and 15), and on the
other hand it was decreed that „from now on no layman or monk can
rise straightaway to the heights of the episcopate, but after being first
tested in the ecclesiastical degrees, he can receive the ordination of the
episcopate” (17th canon)3
, so that there should be no recurrence of
similar situations.
What we should not look for in the text of the 15th canon
Thus the Synod had the purpose to heal a situation of schism. But in
order to avoid the interpretation that breaking communion for the
reason of heresy could be also treated as a schism, especially because
the iconoclast heresy was completely defeated just a few years before
(in 843), in the 15th canon, in its second half, it was underlined that
„...For those who separate from communion with their president
because of some heresy condemned by the holy councils or fathers [...]
2 Prolegomena on the First-and-Second Council, The Rudder, p. 453
3 The 17 canons of the so-called First-and-Second Council held in the Temple of the
Holy Apostles interpreted, canon 17, The Rudder, p. 473: ”henceforth none of the
laymen or monks shall be allowed to ascend to the height of the episcopacy
precipitately and multitudinously as in a stampede, but, on the contrary; by being duly
examined with the refernece to the various ecclesiastical degrees or grades, let them
thus attain to ordination to the episcopacy.”
5
not only are not subject to the penalty settled by the canons [...] but are
also worthy of the honour befitting the Orthodox”4
.
In fact the second part of this canon states that the orthodox who
separate themselves from the heretical false-bishops, even if the latter
have not been condemned by a synod, can not be judged through the
anti-schismatic canons 13, 14 and 15, since „they have not sundered the
unity of the Church by a schism, but have endeavoured to protect the
Church from schisms and divisions”.
In other words the 15th canon does not represent a „guide” or an
„instruction” for ceasing commemoration of heretics, as it is treated by
some, but it only expresses the only situation in which breaking
communion is not a schism.
It’s interesting that Athonite monks who fought against the unia of
Lyon in the 13th century wrote a confession of faith to the emperor in
which they justified their separation from the heretical patriarch John
Vekkos firstly based on Scripture, then on the 1st canon of the
Quinisext Council, then on the „Tomos of unity” and only after that
they mentioned also the 15th canon of the Synod I-II.
There are a lot of cases in the history of the Church when orthodox
christians, monks, priests and bishops have broken communion with
heretics long before the 15th canon was issued in 861. Therefore it is
important not to treat the subject of the cessation of commemoration
exclusively in the context of the 15th canon, because it does not exhaust
the topic, having a totally another purpose than that of providing an
4 Canon 15, First-and-Second Council, The Rudder, p. 471: ”...But as for those
persons, on the other hand, who, on account of some heresy condemned by holy
Councils, or Fathers, withdrawing themselves from communion with their president,
who, that is to say, is preaching the heresy publicly, and teaching it barehead in
church, such persons not only are not subject to any canonical penalty on account of
their having walled themselves off from any and all communion with the one called a
Bishop before any conciliar or synodal verdict has been rendered, but, on the
contrary, they shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among
Orthodox Christians.”

exact definition of the procedure for ceasing commemoration of
heretics, and therefore it has many gaps, meaning that it does not give a
clear answer to the questions which we naturally could ask ourselves,
namely:
 What is actually the purpose of breaking communion?
 Is the cessation of the commemoration of heretics optional or
compulsory?
 Whom should the orthodox commemorate instead of the local
bishop who fell into heresy?
 What’s the relationship between the walled off christians and
bishops from other dioceses?
 Should communion be broken only with the heretics or also with
those who maintain communion with them?
 Do the mysteries of the heretics continue to be valid if they have
not been condemned yet by name?
Obviously the 15th canon does not give a clear answer for these
questions, since it has been issued for a completely different purpose,
that of stating which separation is a schism and which is not a schism.
Consequently, the attempt to answer them exclusively in the context of
this canon, isolating it from the rest of the Tradition of the Church,
leads inevitably to misinterpretations, a fact which can be witnessed
following the recent polemics.
The answer to these and other similar questions should be sought in the
Holy Scripture, the decisions of the Local and Ecumenical Synods and
in the acts and writings of the Holy Fathers, a work which should
necessarily be done in order to avoid splits and misinterpretations. But
before this, it is important to realize the limits of the 15th canon and not
attribute to it ideas that it does not contain.
Further we will try to express the answers that we have found for the
questions listed above. Actually they don’t pretend to be an expression
of the ultimate truth, but represent a synthesis of the studies which we
7
have made seeking a patristic answer for these problems, therefore we
kindly ask the readers to come with criticisms and suggestions, so that
we could help each other on the way to salvation.
What is the purpose of breaking communion with heretics? Is
it optional or compulsory?
Regarding the act of the cessation of commemoration there have been
formulated some interpretations which state that it represents a „note of
protest” or that its purpose is „convocation of a synod” which would
condemn the heresy, but we don’t find such ideas in the text of the 15th
canon. If treated separately, they can seem pretty noble. But to what
extent do such ideas coincide with the intents of the Holy Fathers?
What thought drove them to break communion with heretics and to
teach us to do the same?
In one of his epistles, St. Theodore the Studite says: „If one gets into
this trap [the abyss of heresy], the communion with heretics separates
him from Christ and casts him away from the flock of the Lord”5
.
Also in other letters: „The communion given by a heretic or by one
obviously condemned for his way of life estranges from God and
throws you into the hands of the devil”6
, „Communion with heretics is
not a common bread, but a poison that does not harm the body, but
blackens and darkens the soul”7
.
It is clear that for St. Theodore breaking communion with heretics is a
question of salvation! But since some so-called theologians have
endeavored to denigrate St. Theodore the Studite, saying that he
expressed just some personal opinions that do not concord with the
Scriptures and other Holy Fathers, let us see some other witnesses.

The holy Apostle John the Theologian says: „If there come any unto
you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house,
neither bid him God speed” (2 John 1:10). Why can’t we receive and
salute him? „For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
deeds” (2 John 1:11).
St. John Chrysostom tells us about the relationship with heretics: „Do
not have any communion with them – don’t eat with them, don’t drink,
don’t bind friendships with them, neither relationships, neither love,
neither peace”. For what reason? „Because if someone links up with
heretics in these things, he becomes alien to the Catholic Church”8
.
Writing to a monk about a new heresy that had appeared in those
places, St. Basil the Great says: „That’s why I beg you to put this for an
ecclesiastical examination and to withdraw from the communion with
heretics, knowing that disregard for this question destroys our zeal for
Christ”9
.
St. Joseph Volotsky, who confronted the heresy of the judaizers10 in the
XIV-XV centuries, said: „If he will turn out to be a heretic, we will try
not to receive either his teaching or his Communion, and not only will
we receive no Communion from him, but we’ll condemn him and expose
him with all our power, so that we do not become partakers of his
perdition”11
.
Here is how the aforementioned Athonite Confessors justified their
separation from the heretical patriarch John Vekkos: „He who receives
the heretic is ought to the same condemnation as him [...] How can we
rightfully recognize them as heads and judges of the Orthodox Church
and how can we proclaim their commemoration as an orthodox one in

and about the signs of the end of this age, ch. 7

the church and especially at the Lord's Supper, so that it should
continue to sanctify us without defilement?”12
.
In his letter to the Christians from Spain about some apostate bishops
from there, St. Cyprian of Carthage says: „The crowd should not
comfort itself that it can remain untouched by the contagion of sin if
it is in communion with a sinful bishop and gives him the permission for
the unjust and unlawful service as its hierarch, since the harshness of
God threatens and says through the prophet Hosea (9:4): „Their
sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat
thereof shall be polluted”, teaching and showing that all those who get
polluted by the sacrifices of a profane („from outside the Church”) and
unlawful bishop are totally partakers of the sin”13
.
St. Nectarios of Aegina gives us the same confession: „The lack of
external communion (with heretics) defends us from the internal
estrangement (from God, from truth)”14
.
There is such a complete consonance between the words of the
Scriptures and all of these Holy Fathers regarding the communion with
heretics and its consequences for ourselves! When reading these words
with care, we cannot diminish the importance of the act of breaking
communion, saying that it has a purely disciplinary or administrative
purpose, or that it is just a note of protest or a strategic action for a
possible synod. Communion with heretics is, first of all, a big threat to
the salvation of our soul, whence it is a natural measure to break it, so
that we do not become partakers of their perdition and not estrange
ourselves from Christ.

confession of faith against the unia of Lyon (1272-74)

canon
10
Therefore can we even ask if this measure is optional or compulsory? It
could be optional only inasmuch as we are unconcerned about our
salvation. If the Church teaches us that in this way we endanger our
salvation, can a faithful Christian ask if it is optional or not?
Whom should the Orthodox commemorate instead of the local
bishop who fell into heresy? What’s the relationship between
the walled off christians and bishops from other dioceses?
According to the order of the Church, it is mandatory for the priests to
commemorate their bishop at the holy services (if he is „not having any
grounds for condemning the bishop with regard to religion or justice”
15), meaning the ecclesiastical ruler of that specific territory (in addition
to this there can be commemorated also other bishops). If he falls into
heresy and his commemoration is naturally terminated, there is no
canonical basis for commemorating a bishop from another diocese
instead.
The Holy Fathers who talked in detail about the cessation of
commemoration, e.g. St. Theodore the Studite and the Athonite
Confessors from the 13th century, do not write at all about who should
be commemorated instead of the local heretical bishop or which
formula should be pronounced instead.
Therefore we can consider that the formula „All the Orthodox bishops”
(or „All the Orthodox episcopate”) that has been used in the 20th
century and in recent years, expresses fairly well the ecclesiological
realities and does not break the canonical order of the Church.
Another important question is: to what extent can the orthodox bishops
from other dioceses get involved in matters of the Christians who have
walled themselves off from their heretical bishop? Regarding this
question there are many witnesses from Church Tradition.
15 Canons of the Holy Apostles, Canon 31
11
For instance St. Gregory the Theologian writes that he has been invited
to Constantinople by Orthodox priests and laymen16, who had a single
little church in Constantinople17, to shepherd them and to confront the
heretics who dominated the capital city of the empire18, having the arian
archbishop Demophilus as their leader. Judging strictly from a
canonical point of view19, St. Gregory had absolutely no right to come
to a foreign diocese to take care of the local flock, but in the time of
heresy these norms can not be applied the same way as in the time of
peace.
The same thing is affirmed by St. Theodore the Studite. Being asked by
one of his disciples if they can have communion with priests ordained
in Italy and Sicily (the canons prohibit the ordination of priests for
foreign dioceses), the holy man answered: „In the time of heresy, when
there is necessity, not everything happens exactly according to the
rules determined in the time of peace. We see that blessed Athanasius
and the most holy Eusebius acted in the same way, as they both
ordained people from outside their region”20
.
St. Basil the Great with his bishops also asked fellow bishops from the
West not to be indifferent about the state of affairs they were in, but to
come there to summon together a large synod which could „cast the
heresy out and offer the Churches the word of peace, bringing to
agreement those who think the same way”21
.
Thus Orthodox bishops absolutely have the right to be involved with
and to help the Christians from dioceses that are controlled by heretics.
This refers to the actual struggle against the heresy, as well as to the

12
solving of pastoral problems, such as the ordination of priests or other
matters that require a hierarch’s involvement.
Should communion be broken only with heretics or also with
those who maintain communion with them?
Since this question is not treated in the 15th canon, it unfortunately
became a stumbling-block, despite the fact that Holy Fathers are really
firm about it. For example in his letter to some monks, St. Athanasius
the Great says: „My beloved, deign to avoid those who have clearly
impious thoughts and run away from those who, considering that they
don’t think like Arius, are actually in communion with the wicked”22
.
St. Nikephoros the Confessor, making a confession of faith in his
epistle to St. Pope Leo III, wrote: „I anathematize those who
relinquished the tradition of the saints and joined the depraved and
deadly teachings of those who dared to sow tares in the field of the
Orthodox Faith and all those who follow them, as a shame for the
Church of Christ, I abhor and anathematize them”23
.
While being less rigid in this regard, St. Theodore the Studite still says
that we cannot have communion with those who maintain communion
with heretics, even though the first ones have an Orthodox mindset:
„Regarding the Orthodox priest that out of fear of persecution
commemorates the heretical bishop I answered you before and I will
say again: if he does not serve together with the heretic and does not
have communion with such people, he should be received in the
community for psalmody, blessing of the meals, and this out of
oikonomia, but not for Divine Communion”24
.
Here we must take note of a factor that is repeated often by St.
Theodore the Studite in his epistles, namely that this oikonomia can be
22 St. Athanasius the Great – Epistle to those who endeavor in the monastic life
23 St. Nikephoros the Confessor – Epistle to Pope Leo III
24 St. Theodore the Studite – Epistle 40. To the son Naucratius.
13
applied towards the clerics that maintain communion with heretics out
of fear of persecution, not out of uncertainty, friendship, apathy,
wickedness or other reasons, as it is affirmed by some who take this
teaching out of context.
The conscious communion with heretics is a great betrayal and any man
who has the fear of God should be aware of that. Of course, this doesn’t
mean that all those who maintain the communion with ecumenists
should be treated the same way as the ecumenists themselves, we see
this attitude at St. Theodore the Studite and other Holy Fathers, e.g. St.
Athanasius the Great who was asked ”in what way those who had fallen
into communion with Arians should be received”
, and answered:
„Regarding those who fell and led the wickedness, the penitents should
be treated with leniency, but should not be given a place in the clergy,
but those who were not workers of the wickedness by themselves, but
have been engaged in it through need or violence, they should be
forgiven, and should be given a place in the clergy”25
.
Thus the separation from the heretics implies also breaking eucharistic
communion with those who continue to be in liturgical unity with them,
even if the latter have an Orthodox mindset and maintain this
communion out of fear or by compulsion. On the other hand, we should
be aware of human weaknesses, so such people should not be treated
the same way as the evident heretics.
Do the mysteries of the heretics continue to be valid if they
have not been nominally condemned yet?
Unfortunately the question of the validity of mysteries performed by
heretics has raised a lot of disputes and misinterpretations, for that
reason we need to make a multilateral analysis of this idea. But first of
all let’s emphasize that it’s not the presence or absence of grace among
the heretics that is urging us to depart from communion with them, but
25 St. Athanasius the Great – Epistle to Rufinian
14
the wish to stay in Truth and separate from falsehood, the love for
Christ and the avoidance of eternal death. In the works of Holy Fathers
we do not see this obsession towards this matter either.
Also, in all the years that we have been studying this problem and been
trying to take an Orthodox position towards the heresy of ecumenism,
we have not been preoccupied by the question of the validity of
heretics’ mysteries. More than that, the present study has been made by
us rather because we have been constrained by the situation, as we
observed that an excessive emphasis has been placed on this matter and
especially on the idea that the mysteries of the heretics are indisputably
valid. So this fact determined us to study the patristic attitude towards
this question.
Generally, the assertion that the mysteries of heretics are valid is based
on the fact that the ecumenists have not been condemned by name yet,
which means that there is created a distinction between condemned
heretics and uncondemned heretics, a distinction that can’t be found in
the writings of the Holy Fathers. Usually in support of this idea there
are brought two arguments: St. Nicodemus the Hagiorite’s
interpretation of the 3rd Apostolic Canon and the fact that the 3rd and
the 7th Ecumenical Councils decided to receive those who had been
ordained by the Nestorian and Iconoclast heretics before the latters’
condemnation without repeating their cheirotonia26. But let us see how
justified are these arguments.
In the footnote of the aforementioned interpretation, St. Nicodemus
says the following: „The canons command the synod of the bishops that
are alive to defrock the priests, or to excommunicate or to anathematize
the laymen when they break the canons. But if the synod will not apply
the defrocking of priests, or excommunication, or anathema of laymen,
then these priests and laymen are not actually defrocked, nor
26 ordination
15
anathematized”27
. In other words, the penalties laid down in the canons
do not become automatically valid, but first have to be proclaimed by a
synod of bishops.
At the first sight one could understand that this refers also to the
condemnation of the heretics, who would therefore continue to be
members of the Church until an orthodox synod would condemn them.
But since the heresy is not a regular sin or an ordinary canonical
violation, but as St. Ignaty Brianchaninov says: „Heresy is the rebellion
and revolt of the creature against the Creator, the rebellion and revolt
of the most tiny and limited being, the human, against the all-perfect
God”28
, let us see if in the aforementioned interpretation St. Nicodemus
(and the canons on the whole) treat the heresy along with all canonical
violations (that can be moral, administrative, disciplinary etc.), since we
have seen that, for instance, the 15th canon of the I-II Synod has
different regulations for heresy and for ordinary canonical violations.
For example, the 14th canon of the Synod of Sardica states that a priest
has to accept his defrocking, even if he has been defrocked unjustly
by the bishop, until this decision should be overturned by a synod. It
looks like this canon contradicts the 15th canon of the Synod I-II, which
states that in such cases the Orthodox priests „not only are not subject
to the penalty laid down by the canons, but are also worthy of the
honour befitting the orthodox”. Actually, this apparent contradiction
between the canons refers to different situations, one is in regard to a
defrocking proclaimed by an Orthodox hierarch and the other is about
the relationship with a heretical hierarch.
27 Apostolic 3rd Canon (footnote), The Rudder, p. 5: ”The Canons command the
council of living bishops to depose the priests, or to excommunicate them, or to
anathematize laymen who violate the canons. Yet, if the council does not actually
effect the deposition of the priests, or the excommunication, or the anathematization of
laymen, these priests and laymen, are neither actually deposed, nor
excommunicated, nor anathematized.”
28 St. Ignaty Brianchaninov – About heresy and schism, ch. 1
16
For instance, we know from St. Gregory Palamas that „if [bishops]
abandon Orthodoxy, they lose not only their ecclesiastic authority, but
even the title of christians, as their anathemas have no value at all”29
.
So St. Gregory, of course, continued to serve after he had been
condemned for ceasing commemoration of the patriarch in 134430
.
Heresy is not just an ordinary canonical violation, since, for example,
the First Ecumenical Council did not issue a single canon condemning
Arius and Arians, as they have been condemned within the meetings of
the Council. It would be a mistake to relate to heretical hierarchs
through the prism of canons that refer to orthodox hierarchs.
On the other hand, St. Nicodemus the Hagiorite reveals that even the
defrocked priest is not totally estranged from the priesthood, saying that
„even Joseph Bryennius in his epistle to Nicetas says that whatever
those who have been deposed have the hardihood to perform is holy
and effective. This is avowed as the opinion also of wise and learned
Eugenius Boulgaris in his critical observations on the grammar written
by Neophytus , in support of which he cites Nicholas Cabasilas.”31
.
Obviously if the 3rd and 28th apostolic canons had referred also to
heretics, it would be impossible for the interpreters to recognise their
power to perform holy services even after their condemnation. Let’s not
confound decrees relating to those who are sinners, but are Orthodox,
with those relating to the heretics!
Furthermore, if in the aforementioned interpretation St. Nicodemus the
Hagiorite referred also to heretics, then it really would be a great
blasphemy to deny the authenticity of the mysteries performed by
heretics that have not been condemned by name yet. In that case, in
order to keep us away from such a blasphemy, the Holy Fathers would
29 „Rejection of the epistle of Patriach of Antioch”, „Letter to nun Xenia”, PG 150,
1045BC apud ”The Lives of the Pillars of Orthodoxy”, Holy Apostles Convent, Buena
Vista, USA, 1990
30 ”The Lives of the Pillars of Orthodoxy”, Holy Apostles Convent, Buena Vista,
USA, 1990
31 28th Apostolic Canon, 2nd footnote, The Rudder, p. 42
17
have underlined over and over again that uncondemned heretics have
true mysteries and when, on the other hand, they denied the heretics’
mysteries, they certainly would have indicated that they refer to already
condemned heretics. But there is no such distinction in their writings.
Furthermore, there are lots of Holy Fathers’ testimonies regarding the
mysteries performed by heretics and we certainly can not suspect them
of blasphemy!
For instance, St. Theodore the Studite refused to recognise as a bishop
the one who talked in an Orthodox way, but maintained communion
with heresy, and also he denied the ordinations performed by the latter
until his repentance: „You gave a good answer to the priest and
hegumen: those who have been ordained by a bishop who has turned
out to be a heretic, although he says that the synod was bad and that we
perished, have been cast out from the priesthood. For why, while
recognising this, does he not run away from perdition, evading the
heresy, to be a bishop of God? Then his ordinations will be received
immediately. Or why, in a time of the domination of heresy, has the
hegumen sent the brethren for a heretical ordination?”32
.
St. Joseph Volotsky, whom we mentioned before, said: „Without the
grace of the Holy Spirit none of the priests can do anything. But the
heretics had the wicked satanic spirit within themselves; how can they
bind and loose in heaven and on earth?33
. Could we admit that this
satanic spirit enters the man as a result of a synodal condemnation? But
in this case we must conclude that such a synodal condemnation, that
diabolizes the man, is a great sin!
Here’s what St. Basil the Great wrote about bishop Fronton, who
pretended to be Orthodox, but received his ordination from Arians: „I
won’t count among the priests of Christ one who has been promoted to
32 St. Theodore the Studite – Epistle 40. To the son Naucratius.
33 St. Joseph Volotsky – The enlightener, Word nr. XII
18
leadership by the filthy hands of heretics for the devastation of the
faith”34
.
When St. Hypatius of Rufinian was asked: „Why did you delete his
name [Nestorius’, our note] without waiting to see what will happen?”,
the holy man answered: „Since I heard that he talks indecently about
my Lord, I broke communion with him and don’t commemorate his
name, because he is not a bishop anymore”35
.
Writing about the 7th Ecumenical Council, St. Nicodemus the Hagiorite
says the following in The Rudder: „This Council was assembled against
the ungodly iconomachs who used to disparage the Christians. The
Council anathematized them, and especially Anastasius, Constantine,
and Nicetas, the pseudo-patriachs [of Constantinople – in the
Romanian translation] who held office during the time of the
iconomachs...”36. Let us remind ourselves that in the 15th canon of the
Synod I-II, the bishops who preach the heresy are also called false-
bishops or pseudo-bishops. But if without a synodal condemnation they
continue to be legitimate hierarchs, then it would be truly a great
blasphemy to deny their episcopal and patriarchal dignity, as we have
seen before.
We consider that in this matter the crucial point is the question: what
separates a man from the Church – the heresy or the synodal
condemnation by name?
The holy Apostle Paul says: „A man that is an heretic after the first and
second admonition reject; knowing that he that is such is subverted, and

about an incorrigible heretic, completely subverted, who is condemned
of himself, meaning he has no exoneration. Because he can’t say:
nobody blamed me, nobody taught me. So if after the admonition he
persists in the same, then he is condemned of himself”37
.
But in order to avoid any doubts that this self-condemnation means also
separation from the Church, let us see some more patristic witnesses.
When the 5th Ecumenical Council was accused of anathematizing
Theodore of Mopsuestia post-mortem, since they considered that a dead
person can not be condemned, the Holy Synod responded: „Don’t they
know, or maybe they know but feign ignorance, that the
anathematization is nothing else but separation from God? Even if the
wicked did not receive it from somebody through words, he proclaims
anathema against himself through the deed, separating himself
through his wickedness from the true life”38
.
St. Nikephoros the Confessor considered that „when they [iconoclasts]
rejected our glorious and pure faith, they departed themselves from the
great and indivisible body of Church as rotten and tainted members
and recklessly joined the assemble of the heterodox”39
. Thus they
separated themselves from the Church through the rejection of the true
faith, not through a „synodal condemnation”.
In one of his epistles to his son Naucratius, St. Theodore the Studite
says: „I witness before God and men: they departed themselves from
the body of Christ, from the higher throne, where Christ put the keys of
the faith, against which, by the promise of the Unlying One, the gates of
hell, meaning the mouth of the heretics, have not prevailed and will not
prevail until the end of time (Matt. 16:18)”40

In the Patericon compiled by St. Ignaty Brianchaninov, Abba Agathon
gives the following explanation on why he accepted all accusations
except the one that called him a heretic: „Heresy is separation from
God. The heretic separates himself from the Living and the true God
and unites himself with the devil and his angels. He who is separated
from Christ has no God anymore, to Whom he could pray for his sins,
and has perished from all points of view”41
.
St. Gregory Palamas gives us the following witness: „Those who belong
to the Church of Christ dwell in the truth, so those who don’t have the
truth, don’t belong to the Church of Christ, no matter how much they
proclaim lies when they call themselves holy shepherds and hierarchs
and are called this way by others. Because we remember that
Christianity is not defined by external appearance, but by the truth and
exactness of the faith”42
.
Discussing the mystery of chrismation, St. Nicodemus the Hagiorite
makes the following commentary: „But how can a heretic sanctify any
such myron when as a matter of fact he has no Holy Spirit because of
his being separated therefrom on account of heresy and schism?”43, he
doesn’t say „separated because of the synodal condemnation”, but „for
[reason of] heresy and schism”.
St. Cyprian of Carthage asks himself: „Can the one who opposes and
acts against the Church hope that he is within the Church, when the
blessed apostle Paul, reasoning about the same matter and showing the
mystery of unity, says: „There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye
are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one
baptism” (Eph. 4:4-5)?”44 And the 68th Apostolic Canon forbids
anyone to receive a second ordination „unless it be established that his

ordination has been performed by heretics. For those who have been
baptized or ordained by such persons cannot possibly be either faithful
Christians or clergymen”45
.
Also St. Nikephoros the Confessor says the following about the
iconoclasts who previously signed the Orthodox Confession at the 7th
Ecumenical Council, but after that fell again into heresy: „All these
things were confessed with their own hands by those who have
separated themselves from the Church now. And if they renounce their
own confession, then they trample upon their own crosses and put
themselves under the aforementioned anathematization and in no case
are they within the Church”46
. Obviously those whom St. Nikephoros
talks about had not been condemned nominally at that time.
But in order to dispel any doubts, let’s take a look at what the
iconoclasts said about themselves at the 7th Ecumenical Council. Here
is the confession of an iconoclast bishop which desired to return to the
Church: „That’s why I, Basil, bishop of the city of Ancyra, wishing to
join the Catholic Church, I am giving this written confession...
”47
(continuing with an Orthodox Confession of faith and anathematization
of the heresy), meaning he considered himself to be already outside of
the Church. And Theodore, bishop of Myra, said: „And I, a sinner and
unworthy, after long reflection and a thorough discussion have chosen
what’s the best and I am begging God and your holiness to unite me, a
sinner, along with the others, with the Holy Catholic Church”48
. Other
hierarchs had similar speeches, asking to be received into the Church by
the Council.
The fact that this attitude is natural was proved by the whole 7th
Ecumenical Council. Thus „His Holiness, patriarch Tarasius, said:
45 Canons of the Holy Apostles, Canon 68, The Rudder, p. 119
46 St. Nikephoros the Confessor – Word in defence of the Universal Church regarding
the new dispute about the holy icons

„How should we regard this heresy, that has appeared again in our
days?”
John, the most reverend deputy of the apostolic see in the east, said:
„Heresy separates any man from the Church”
The Holy Council said: „That’s obvious””49
.
The heresy separates the man from the Church, not the synodal
condemnation, since the Councils are obedient to God, not vice versa:
„For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us” (Acts 15:28).
We see from this multitude of witnesses that the heretics, even those
uncondemned, were considered and even considered themselves to be
outside of the Church, being condemned of themselves. Of course, we
can not accept in any way that, being outside of the Church, they had
the power to perform authentic mysteries (the existence of mysteries
outside the Church is a heretical ecumenist thesis). But how can we
explain the fact that those who were ordained by them have been
received without repeating their ordination?
Right in the acts of the Council we can see that this measure was
applied towards those bishops who repented and rejected the heresy in
front of Orthodox hierarchs, and this decision was taken based on a
letter of St. Athanasius the Great in which he says: „Those who have
fallen and have been defenders of the wickedness should be forgiven if
they repent, but should not receive a place in the clergy, but those who
did not lead the wickedness, but have been involved in it through need
and violence, it was decided to forgive, and to offer them a place in
clergy”50
. We see that regarding the heads of the heresy St. Athanasius
doesn’t say that they „should be deposed”, but „should not receive a
place in the clergy”, so he did not consider them to be clerics before
their repentance.

After hearing this witness from St. Athanasius and other Holy Fathers,
the 7th Ecumenical Council decided that those heretics (and those
ordained by them) who rejected the heresy and did not have other
canonical impediments should be received without repeating their
ordination, so it’s not about an unconditional recognition of all the
mysteries performed by iconoclasts.
Therefore the interpretation that the mysteries performed by the heretics
before their condemnation are a priori valid, is wrong. Only an
Orthodox Council can receive the ordinations performed by heretics, on
condition that the ordained men reject the heresy of those who have
ordained them and do not have other canonical impediments.
One more proof of this fact can be found in St. Theodore the Studite,
who wrote to bishop Euthymius about some priest: „You know, Your
Grace, that by the common voice of the confessors that are still on the
earth and those who have recently passed away to the Lord it was
determined that consecrated persons, that once have been upbraided
for communion with heretics, should be banned from serving until the
time of the higher Providence’s discretion”51
.
Actually this theory about the works of the salvific Grace amongst the
uncondemned heretics defies not only the Christian conscience, but
even the human morality. After all, knowing that the heretics, after their
condemnation, pull away with themselves whole peoples and local
churches, isn’t it a great moral fall to deprive so many people of grace
and salvation? If Nestorius, Dioscorus or the heretical popes of Rome
were true hierarchs and a multitude of people received through them the
grace of salvation, would it not be a real act of misanthropy to condemn
them and therefore so many generations of Armenians, Copts,
Ethiopians, Syro-Jacobites or Western peoples? For it is obvious that
the majority of ordinary people did not understand the theological
subtleties and have just followed their bishops. If the latter really were
authentic bishops before their condemnation, wouldn’t it be wiser to
51 St. Theodore the Studite – Epistle 83(271). To Euthymius, bishop of Sardica.
24
just forbid them to preach their heresies or, in the end, to cut off their
tongue so that they could not spread the poison of their teaching, but
could remain within the Church together with the crowds that followed
them?
On the other hand if only a conciliar condemnation of their names is
valid, then what’s the point of the anathematizations that are not
pronounced against somebody in particular? „If any man preach any
other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be anathema!”
(Gal. 1:9) – why would the Apostle pronounce a condemnation with no
validity?
On the same note: what’s the point of the anathematizations pronounced
against persons who have passed away? If only the conciliar
condemnation separates one from the Church, then we ask ourselves:
did Origen, Constantine Copronymus and other heretics die within or
outside the Church, since they were condemned much later than their
death? The anathema that has been pronounced against them signifies
the fact that they have separated themselves from the Church during
their lifetime, because you can’t separate from it after passing away, so
the Council just ascertained their fall away from the Church,
pronouncing anathema against them.
In one of his sermons on the Sunday of Orthodoxy, St. Theophan the
Recluse says the following: „Whether or not is pronounced anathema
against your teaching and your name, you are already under it when
you philosophize against the Church and persist in this philosophy”52
.
In the end we would like to advise the Christians that fall in this trap,
that is, recognition of the validity of heretics’ mysteries (even of those
uncondemned), to remember the decision of the bishops of the Russian
Orthodox Church outside Russia from 1983, that, being hurled against
ecumenists, states the following: „Those who do not distinguish the
52 St. Theofan the Recluse – Manuscripts from the cell, What is anathema? Word on
the Sunday of Orthodoxy.
25
priesthood and mysteries of the Church from those of the heretics, but
say that the baptism and eucharist of heretics is effectual for salvation,
anathema!”. Let us stand well, let us stand with fear, let us remember!
Based on all the above-stated, we conclude that:
 Those canons that have been laid down for the usual
ecclesiastical problems can not be used as a guide for the relationship
with heretics.
 The Holy Fathers did not make a clear distinction between those
condemned nominally and uncondemned heretics, calling all of them
heretics.
 Heresy separates a man from the Church, heretics are
condemned of themselves and fall away from the Church when they
insist on their heresy, rejecting the admonitions given to them.
 Based on the example of the 7th Ecumenical Council, orthodox
councils can receive the repentant heretics (and those ordained by them)
in their current ecclesiastical rank, on condition that they don’t have
other canonical impediments.
 There is absolutely no basis for the belief that mysteries
performed by the heretics (condemned or uncondemned) are effectual
for salvation. On the other hand, there are a lot of patristic testimonies
that deny the authenticity of their mysteries. Thus the recognition of the
mysteries of heretics is one of the basic theses of the pan-heresy of
ecumenism.
 Since the cessation of communion with heretics is not based on
the validity/non-validity of their mysteries, but first of all on the fact
that otherwise we endanger our salvation, the matter of „validity of
mysteries” of heretics is not decisive for our actions and should not be
regarded with the obsession that can be observed nowadays.
We can wall ourselves off from ecumenists without stepping in the trap
of discussions regarding the action of grace in their mysteries,
answering the same way as St. Maximus the Confessor did when he
was asked:
26
„
– So, you are the only one who will be saved and all the others will
perish?
He told them:
– The three young men who did not worship the idol that has been
worshipped by all the people did not condemn anybody (Daniel 3:18),
since they did not look upon the others, but looked not to fall by
themselves from the true worship of God [...] But I prefer rather to die
then to have my conscience disturbed by the fact that I have slipped in
any way regarding the faith”53
.
