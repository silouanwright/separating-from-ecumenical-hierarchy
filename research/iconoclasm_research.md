# Byzantine Iconoclasm: An Orthodox Perspective

Byzantine Iconoclasm represents one of the most significant theological controversies in Orthodox Christian history, spanning over a century and fundamentally shaping the Church's understanding of religious imagery and the Incarnation. For Orthodox Christians, this period ultimately demonstrates the triumph of Orthodox theology over what the Church considers heretical opposition to sacred images.

## The Two Iconoclastic Periods

Byzantine Iconoclasm occurred in two distinct phases. The **First Iconoclasm** lasted from **726 to 787 CE**[1][2][3], while the **Second Iconoclasm** extended from **814/815 to 843 CE**[1][2][3]. These periods were marked by imperial legislation banning the production and veneration of religious images, with the cross promoted as the primary acceptable symbol for Byzantine churches[4].

## Key Imperial Figures

### The First Period (726-787)

**Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (717-741)** initiated the iconoclastic controversy around 726-730 with a series of edicts against religious images[1][5][6]. Born in Germanikeia (modern-day Turkey), Leo interpreted military defeats by Arab forces and natural disasters like the massive volcanic eruption in the Aegean Sea (726-727) as divine punishment for icon veneration[7][6]. His background in eastern frontier regions, where Islamic influence was strong, likely contributed to his iconoclastic views[8][9].

**Emperor Constantine V (741-775)** became the most fervent iconoclastic emperor[10][11]. He convened the **Council of Hieria in 754**, which formally condemned icon veneration as idolatrous[10][12]. Constantine systematically destroyed icons, persecuted monks and iconophiles, and even forced monks to marry nuns publicly in the Hippodrome to humiliate their vows[10][11]. His theological treatises argued that Christ's divine nature made Him impossible to depict accurately[10].

### The Second Period (815-843)

**Emperor Leo V the Armenian (813-820)** reinitiated iconoclasm in 815, likely motivated by military defeats against the Bulgarians, which he interpreted as divine displeasure with icon veneration[13][14]. In March 815, he deposed the Orthodox Patriarch Nicephorus and convened a synod reimposing the iconoclastic decrees of 754[13][15].

**Emperor Theophilus (829-842)** was the last iconoclastic emperor[16][17]. Though more moderate than Constantine V, he still enforced iconoclastic policies and branded iconophile artists[16][18]. His wife **Empress Theodora** secretly maintained Orthodox icon veneration despite the imperial prohibition[19][16].

## Major Church Councils

### The Council of Hieria (754)

Constantine V convened this council at the palace of Hieria near Constantinople, attended by 338 bishops[12][20]. The council declared icons blasphemous, arguing that depicting Christ either separated His divine and human natures (Nestorianism) or confused them (Monophysitism)[12][21]. They proclaimed the Eucharist as the only legitimate image of Christ and anathematized icon veneration as idolatry[12][22].

### The Second Council of Nicaea (787)

**Empress Irene** convened this council, recognized by Orthodox Christianity as the **Seventh Ecumenical Council**[23][24]. Meeting at Nicaea with papal legates present, 263 bishops condemned the Council of Hieria and restored icon veneration[23][25]. The council distinguished between *proskynesis* (veneration) given to icons and *latreia* (worship) reserved for God alone[22][26].

## Iconoclastic Beliefs and Arguments

Iconoclasts grounded their position in several theological arguments:

**Biblical Foundation**: They cited the Second Commandment's prohibition against graven images (Exodus 20:4-5), arguing that icon veneration constituted idolatry[27][21][28].

**Christological Arguments**: Iconoclasts claimed that depicting Christ was impossible without theological error - either separating His natures (Nestorianism) or confusing them (Monophysitism)[12][29]. They argued Christ's divine nature was "uncircumscribable" and therefore undepictable[10].

**The Eucharist as True Image**: They maintained that the Eucharist was the only legitimate representation of Christ, containing His actual presence rather than mere resemblance[12][30].

## The Orthodox Response and Rejection

Orthodox Christianity ultimately rejected iconoclasm based on several fundamental theological principles:

### The Incarnation Defense

**Saint John of Damascus (c. 675-749)** provided the most influential Orthodox response[30][31][26]. Writing from outside Byzantine territory, he argued that the Incarnation fundamentally changed the possibility of depicting God. Since the Word became flesh and took visible form, Christ could legitimately be depicted as any other human being[30][32][26]. John famously declared: "I do not worship matter, I worship the God of matter, who became matter for my sake"[30].

### Theological Distinctions

Orthodox theologians distinguished between worship (*latreia*) owed to God alone and veneration (*proskynesis*) appropriately given to icons[22][31][26]. They argued that honoring an icon directs prayer and devotion to the person depicted, not to the material object itself[33].

### Incarnational Theology

From an Orthodox perspective, iconoclasm implicitly denied the reality of Christ's Incarnation[34][32]. If Christ truly became human and visible, then refusing to depict Him suggests rejection of His full humanity. Orthodox theology sees icons as affirming that God entered the material world and sanctified matter itself[33].

### Traditional Practice

Orthodox defenders demonstrated that Christian art and image veneration dated to the earliest centuries of Christianity, found in catacomb decorations and early church buildings[31][35][26]. This established precedent supported the legitimacy of continued icon veneration.

## The Triumph of Orthodoxy (843)

After Emperor Theophilus died in 842, his wife **Empress Theodora** assumed regency for their young son Michael III[19][15]. Working with **Patriarch Methodius I**, she convened a synod in March 843 that formally condemned iconoclasm and restored icon veneration[19][36]. This event, celebrated as the **"Triumph of Orthodoxy,"** is commemorated annually on the first Sunday of Lent in the Eastern Orthodox Church[3][36][37].

## Orthodox Understanding of the Controversy's Significance

For Orthodox Christians, the iconoclastic controversy represents more than a dispute about religious art. It fundamentally concerned the nature of the Incarnation and God's relationship with the material world. Orthodox theology sees the final victory over iconoclasm as essential to preserving the full implications of Christ's becoming human - that matter itself can be sanctified and serve as a conduit for divine grace[33].

The controversy also demonstrated the dangers of imperial interference in theological matters. While emperors possessed significant authority over church administration, the ultimate triumph of Orthodox icon veneration showed that certain doctrinal truths transcended imperial power[32].

Today, Orthodox Christians view icons not as mere artwork but as "theology in material form"[33] - windows into the divine realm that facilitate prayer and spiritual contemplation while affirming the continuing reality of Christ's Incarnation and the sanctification of creation itself.

Based on the extensive research I've gathered, I can provide a comprehensive overview of how Orthodox clergy and laypeople responded to iconoclastic bishops during the Byzantine Iconoclasm periods. Here is my detailed analysis:

# Liturgical Separation During Byzantine Iconoclasm (726-787, 814-842)

Orthodox clergy and laypeople employed various forms of liturgical separation and resistance when confronted with iconoclastic bishops who were officially commemorated in the Divine Liturgy. These responses were grounded in canonical precedent and represented a systematic theological stance against what Orthodox believers considered heretical leadership.

## The Practice of Non-Commemoration

The most significant form of liturgical resistance was **non-commemoration** (μνημόνευσις) - the deliberate omission of iconoclastic bishops' names during the Divine Liturgy. This practice was theologically justified as Orthodox clergy refused to proclaim communion with hierarchs they considered heretical.

**Saint Theodore the Studite** provided the clearest theological framework for this practice. In his writings, he emphasized that liturgical commemoration constituted a confession of shared faith and ecclesiastical unity. When he faced the iconoclastic Patriarch Nicephorus during the Moechian controversy and later iconoclastic patriarchs, Theodore argued that commemorating heretical bishops would implicate the commemorator in their heresies[1][2].

Theodore wrote explicitly about this principle: "Once the 'grievous false teaching' of the 'Moechian heresy' had been 'decreed' synodally—in the year 809, during the Patriarchate of St. Nicephoros—, the Saint urged Abbot Theophilos 'neither to commune with these individuals [i.e., those who had issued the decree] nor to commemorate them in the [i.e., his] most holy monastery at the Divine Liturgy, because very grave are the threats voiced by the Saints against those who compromise with it [the Moechian heresy].'"[1]

## Canonical Justification

The practice of non-commemoration was supported by **Canon 15 of the First-Second Council** (861), which explicitly endorsed clergy who ceased commemorating bishops preaching heresy. This canon stated that priests who stopped commemorating heretical bishops "even before conciliar condemnation not only are not to be censured, but should be praised as condemning a false bishop"[2][3].

The canon made crucial distinctions: clergy could legitimately separate from bishops who were "preaching heresy publicly" and "teaching it bareheaded in church," even without waiting for formal synodical condemnation[2].

## Specific Examples of Clerical Resistance

### Saint Theodore the Studite (759-826)

Theodore became the most prominent example of liturgical separation during the second iconoclastic period. When Emperor Leo V the Armenian reinitiated iconoclasm in 815, Theodore organized public resistance, including a **Palm Sunday procession with holy icons** in defiance of imperial orders[4]. For this act, he was exiled and spent over fifteen years in various locations for his defense of icons[5].

Theodore developed sophisticated theological arguments for breaking communion with iconoclastic hierarchs. He maintained that heretical bishops became "pseudo-bishops" and "pseudo-teachers" who could neither constitute the center of the Eucharistic Assembly nor fulfill pastoral duties, since they were essentially "wolves" rather than shepherds[1].

### Saint Nicephorus I of Constantinople (758-828)

**Patriarch Nicephorus I** initially served as Patriarch from 806 to 815 during the brief restoration of icon veneration. When Emperor Leo V resumed iconoclasm, Nicephorus steadfastly refused to comply with imperial demands to remove icons. According to the sources, "the patriarch did not bend" when Leo began his campaign to suppress icon veneration[6].

Leo V ultimately deposed Nicephorus on March 13, 815, exiling him to various locations where he continued writing against iconoclasm until his death in 828. Nicephorus left behind three major treatises defending icons and condemning iconoclastic theology[6][7].

### Monastic Communities

Monastic communities became centers of resistance to iconoclastic policies. **Saint Stephen the Younger** (713-765) emerged as a particularly prominent monastic opponent during the first iconoclastic period. His monasteries became "the mainstay of icon veneration, giving the true believers the spirit to oppose the iconoclasts"[8].

Stephen refused all attempts at conversion by iconoclastic authorities. When Constantine V had him brought to trial, Stephen dramatically illustrated his point by throwing a coin bearing the emperor's image on the ground and trampling it, arguing that if disrespecting the emperor's image merited death, then dishonoring images of God and saints deserved even harsher punishment[8].

## Laypeople's Response

While documentation of lay responses is more limited than clerical sources, available evidence suggests significant lay resistance to iconoclastic liturgies.

### Avoidance of Iconoclastic Services

Orthodox laypeople often **stopped attending liturgical services** conducted by iconoclastic clergy. The sources indicate that faithful Orthodox Christians would "stay away from canonical communication with the hierarchy and clergy that complied with the official line"[9]. This separation was considered necessary because such communication was deemed "unacceptable" for canonical and doctrinal reasons[9].

### Underground Orthodox Communities

Some Orthodox communities functioned as **underground networks** during iconoclastic periods. Theodore the Studite's correspondence reveals that he provided "practical advice to his perplexed disciples as to how to lead a Christian life at the time when they had to stay away from canonical communication with the hierarchy and clergy that complied with the official line"[9].

### Popular Resistance

The sources suggest widespread popular opposition to iconoclasm. When Leo III ordered the destruction of an icon of Christ over the entrance to his palace around 730, this created "outrage and the person sent by the emperor was murdered"[10]. Such violent popular reactions indicate strong lay attachment to icons and resistance to their removal.

## Theological Foundations for Separation

Orthodox theologians developed sophisticated justifications for liturgical separation based on several principles:

### Eucharistic Ecclesiology

The separation was grounded in **Eucharistic ecclesiology** - the understanding that the Church's unity is fundamentally Eucharistic rather than merely administrative. Theodore the Studite argued that "the foundations of the Church's unity are not administrative and institutional, but Eucharistic and charismatic"[1].

### Preservation of Orthodoxy

Orthodox resisters maintained they were not creating schism but preserving authentic Orthodox teaching. As Theodore explained, those practicing separation comprised "the 'confessing flock of Christ' in resistance" and functioned "as administrative structures by oikonomia, provisionally, and 'owing to pressing needs'"[1].

### Distinction Between Church and Heretics

A crucial theological distinction undergirded the practice: separation was not from the Church but from heretics who, despite maintaining institutional positions, "are not the Church of God" and "are not the Church of the Lord"[1]. The heretics themselves were considered cut off from the Church, and communion with them would implicate Orthodox believers in their separation.

## Primary Source Evidence

While complete primary source quotes in English translation are limited, some key passages illuminate the practice:

**Saint Theodore the Studite** wrote regarding the necessity of avoiding heretical communion: "the Divine Chrysostomos has declared loudly and clearly that not only heretics, but also those who commune with such people, are enemies of God"[1].

**Canon 15 of the First-Second Council** provided the canonical foundation: "those who separate from their bishop before a synodical investigation because he himself is preaching some misbelief and heresy publicly, not only are not subject to the above penances, but have a right to claim the honor due to Orthodox Christians"[2].

## Historical Significance

The liturgical separation during iconoclasm established important precedents for Orthodox ecclesiology. The practices developed during this period - particularly non-commemoration of heretical bishops - became part of Orthodox canonical tradition and have been invoked in subsequent theological controversies.

The ultimate vindication of these practices came with the **Triumph of Orthodoxy in 843**, when Empress Theodora and Patriarch Methodius restored icon veneration. The Orthodox who had practiced liturgical separation were vindicated, and their resistance was recognized as having preserved authentic Orthodox teaching during a period of imperial and hierarchical error.

The iconoclastic controversy thus demonstrated that Orthodox Christians, both clergy and laity, were willing to risk exile, persecution, and even death rather than compromise their liturgical and theological principles by communing with those they considered heretical authorities.

# St. Theodore the Studite's Response to Iconoclasm: Liturgical Commemoration and Attendance

St. Theodore the Studite developed one of the most comprehensive and theologically sophisticated responses to iconoclasm regarding liturgical practices, particularly concerning commemoration of heretical bishops and attendance at their liturgies. His teachings provide detailed guidance for Orthodox Christians navigating periods of ecclesiastical crisis.

## Non-Commemoration of Heretical Hierarchs

### Doctrinal Foundation

Theodore established that **liturgical commemoration constituted a confession of shared faith and ecclesiastical unity**[1]. He argued that commemorating heretical bishops would implicate the commemorator in their heresies, making such commemoration theologically unacceptable[1].

### Specific Instructions Against Commemoration

In a crucial letter to Abbot Theophilos regarding the Moechian controversy, Theodore provided explicit instructions: **"neither to commune with these individuals [i.e., those who had issued the decree] nor to commemorate them in the [i.e., his] most holy monastery at the Divine Liturgy, because very grave are the threats voiced by the Saints against those who compromise with it [the Moechian heresy], even with regard to eating together [with such heretics]"**[2].

Theodore expanded this principle to include all who participated in heretical synods: since this **"heretical impiety" was proclaimed synodally, all of the Orthodox were to be bold "neither to commune with those of wrong belief nor to commemorate anyone having participated in the Moechian synod or being of like mind with it"**[2].

### Theological Justification

Theodore grounded his position in patristic authority, specifically invoking St. John Chrysostom: **"the Divine Chrysostomos has declared loudly and clearly that not only heretics, but also those who commune with such people, are enemies of God"**[2].

## Liturgical Separation and Attendance

### Complete Avoidance of Iconoclastic Liturgies

Theodore **"pledges to stay away from communion not only performed by a priest who complied in writing with the official policy, but also from a priest who commemorated the bishop who complied"**[1]. This principle extended beyond direct participation to include any clergy who maintained liturgical communion with iconoclastic authorities.

Theodore further declared that **"the church where the heretics served as well could not be used by the Orthodox until the time of a future Council that would make canonical decisions on the case"**[1]. This represented a comprehensive rejection of liturgical spaces contaminated by heretical worship.

### Practical Guidance for Alternative Liturgical Life

Recognizing the challenges this created for Orthodox believers, Theodore provided practical solutions. He **"provides practical advice to his perplexed disciples as to how to lead a Christian life at the time when they had to stay away from canonical communication with the hierarchy and clergy that complied with the official line"**[1].

In a specific letter to his disciple Naukratios dated to 809, Theodore **"advises his disciple to rather serve the Liturgy in a private house than in a church where the priest commemorates the heretic"**[1]. He explicitly mentioned **"consecrated portable altars on wood or cloth"** as alternatives to contaminated church altars[1].

### Private Liturgical Celebrations

Theodore encouraged his **"faithful priests to rather serve the Liturgy in the houses of the faithful Christians on portable altars or antimensia (on boards or cloth)"**[1]. This created an underground network of Orthodox liturgical life during the iconoclastic persecution.

## Ecclesiastical Separation Principles

### Eucharistic Ecclesiology

Theodore's approach was grounded in **Eucharistic ecclesiology** - the understanding that **"the foundations of the Church's unity are not administrative and institutional, but Eucharistic and charismatic"**[2]. A bishop preaching heresy became a **"pseudo-bishop"** and **"pseudo-teacher"** who could **"neither constitute the center of the Eucharistic Assembly nor fulfill the duties of a Shepherd, since he is already a 'wolf'"**[2].

### Distinction Between Church and Heretics

Theodore maintained a crucial theological distinction: separation was not from the Church but from heretics who, despite maintaining institutional positions, **"are not the Church of God"** and **"are not the Church of the Lord"**[2]. The heretics themselves were considered cut off from the Church, and **"all those who commune with them are 'themselves in truth' cut off from the Church"**[2].

### Canonical Precedent

Theodore's practice was supported by **Canon 15 of the First-Second Council**, which stated that clergy who ceased commemorating heretical bishops **"even before conciliar condemnation not only are not to be censured, but should be praised as condemning a false bishop"**[3].

## Personal Actions During Persecution

### Palm Sunday Demonstration

During the second iconoclastic period under Leo V, Theodore organized a **Palm Sunday procession with holy icons** in direct defiance of imperial orders[4]. This public demonstration of Orthodox faith led to his immediate exile.

### Correspondence Network

Theodore maintained an extensive correspondence network during his multiple exiles. **Between 815 and 818 Theodore the Studite wrote 309 letters to his disciples, friends, civic and ecclesiastical hierarchs**[1]. He used this network to provide spiritual guidance and coordinate resistance to iconoclastic policies.

Theodore was cautious in his correspondence, **"being aware that the letters could fall into hostile hands"**[1]. He **"uses encoded letters of the alphabet for naming the persons involved (including his key disciples, the archbishop and the Emperor)"**[1] and transmitted sensitive information orally through trusted carriers.

## Underground Christian Community

### Communication Network

Theodore established **"a communication network and code that would maintain the Studite community and the community of his secular followers and disciples"**[1]. This underground network functioned as a parallel ecclesiastical structure during periods of persecution.

### Private Sacramental Life

The sources indicate that Orthodox believers under Theodore's guidance developed alternative sacramental practices. These included **private communion with pre-sanctified gifts**, the use of **icons as godparents during baptism** in the absence of Orthodox sponsors, and **liturgical celebrations in private homes**[1].

## Letters to Clergy and Laypeople

### Guidance for Clergy

Theodore provided detailed instructions for priests serving the Orthodox community during iconoclastic persecution. His letters addressed practical questions about celebrating liturgy in non-canonical spaces, using portable altars, and maintaining sacramental life while avoiding communion with heretical clergy[1].

### Advice for Laypeople

For laypeople, Theodore emphasized the importance of maintaining Orthodox faith while avoiding participation in iconoclastic worship. His correspondence provided guidance on **"how to lead a Christian life at the time when they had to stay away from canonical communication with the hierarchy and clergy that complied with the official line"**[1].

### Specific Pastoral Concerns

Theodore addressed specific pastoral situations in his letters, including guidance on **baptism in the absence of Orthodox churches**, the selection of **Orthodox godparents**, and **private reservation of the Holy Gifts** for communion during times when access to Orthodox liturgy was restricted[1].

## Theological Significance

Theodore's response to iconoclasm regarding liturgical practices represented more than practical adaptations to persecution. His teachings established fundamental principles of Orthodox ecclesiology, particularly the understanding that **liturgical communion constitutes confession of shared faith** and that **Eucharistic unity, not administrative structures, defines the Church**[2].

His willingness to organize alternative liturgical life rather than compromise with heretical authorities demonstrated the principle that **preserving Orthodox faith takes precedence over maintaining institutional unity with heretical hierarchs**. This approach influenced subsequent Orthodox responses to ecclesiastical crises and established precedents for liturgical separation that continue to inform Orthodox canonical practice.

Theodore's extensive correspondence during this period provides the most detailed contemporary account of how Orthodox Christians maintained their faith and liturgical life during systematic persecution, making his letters invaluable sources for understanding both the practical and theological dimensions of ecclesiastical resistance to heresy.
