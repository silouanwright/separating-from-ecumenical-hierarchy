# Orthodox Eucharistic Theology: Liturgical Commemoration and Spiritual Unity with Heretical Bishops

The Orthodox Church maintains a profound theological understanding that liturgical commemoration during the Divine Liturgy creates real sacramental unity between those commemorating and those commemorated. This principle, rooted in patristic teaching and consistently applied throughout Church history, demonstrates that attending liturgies where heretical bishops are commemorated makes participants spiritually complicit in heresy. The Church Fathers, from Ignatius of Antioch to Mark of Ephesus, have unanimously taught that eucharistic communion requires doctrinal orthodoxy, and that the diptychs—liturgical lists of names commemorated during the Divine Liturgy—serve as touchstones of orthodoxy that both express and create ecclesial communion.

## The theological foundation of commemoration creating sacramental unity

The Orthodox understanding of liturgical commemoration rests on the principle that the Eucharist does not merely serve the Church—it constitutes it. St. Ignatius of Antioch, writing to the Smyrnaeans around 110 AD, established the foundational principle: **"Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church."** This passage, containing the first known use of "Catholic Church" in Christian literature, demonstrates that sacramental validity depends on legitimate episcopal authority and creates actual spiritual unity.

The practice of reading names from the diptychs during the Divine Liturgy evolved from simple memorial lists into theological statements about communion. As Byzantine canonist Theodore Balsamon explained in the 12th century, **"Only those of blameless orthodoxy were put on the diptychs, so the removal of a name implied an accusation of heresy."** The diptychs functioned as declarations of communion, expressions of catholicity, and sacramental actions that made the commemorated persons mystically present in the Body of Christ.

Modern Orthodox theologian John Zizioulas synthesizes this ancient teaching: "The Church constitutes the Eucharist while being constituted by it." The commemoration actualizes unity, transcends time and space by linking the local assembly with the universal Church, and manifests communion by demonstrating sacramental solidarity with those commemorated. When a bishop's name is inscribed in the diptychs and read during the anaphora, the local church declares itself in full sacramental communion with that bishop and his teaching.

## Patristic teachings on complicity through attendance

The Church Fathers consistently taught that attending liturgies where heretical bishops are commemorated creates spiritual complicity in their errors. St. Cyprian of Carthage, writing in his seminal work "De Ecclesiae Catholicae Unitate" (251 AD), declared: **"Whoever is separated from the Church and is joined to an adulteress, is separated from the promises of the Church; nor can he who forsakes the Church of Christ attain to the rewards of Christ. He is a stranger; he is profane; he is an enemy. He can no longer have God for his Father, who has not the Church for his mother."**

St. Ignatius of Antioch warned the Philadelphians: **"Do not err, my brethren. If any man follows him that makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If any one walks according to a strange opinion, he agrees not with the passion [of Christ]."** The saint emphasized that those who do not assemble with the legitimate Church have "manifested their pride and condemned themselves."

The theological reasoning centers on the nature of the Eucharist itself. As Ignatius wrote to the Ephesians: **"Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God."** The Eucharist creates one Body of Christ, and participating in a eucharistic assembly that commemorates heretics incorporates participants into communion with those errors. The Fathers understood that sacramental communion necessarily implies doctrinal communion—one cannot separate the mystical from the theological reality.

## St. John Chrysostom's teachings on commemoration and heresy

St. John Chrysostom, whose liturgy remains the primary eucharistic service of the Orthodox Church, provided extensive teaching on the spiritual effects of commemoration. From patristic compilations, we have his direct statement: **"Do not have any communion with them (heretics)—do not eat with them, do not drink, do not bind friendships with them, neither relationships, neither love."** Theodore the Studite later cited Chrysostom as declaring "not only heretics, but also those who have communion with them, to be enemies of God."

Chrysostom's understanding of the commemorations during the anaphora followed the established hierarchical pattern: clergy commemorated their bishop, bishops their metropolitan, metropolitans their patriarch, and patriarchs commemorated other patriarchs. This created a chain of sacramental unity extending throughout the entire Church. When his own name was removed from the diptychs during his unjust exile, Pope Innocent I "broke off all communion with the Patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch...and Constantinople, until (after the death of Chrysostom) they consented to admit his name into the diptychs of the Church."

In his Sermon 82.6, Chrysostom addressed the gravity of eucharistic participation: **"I speak not only to the communicant, but also I say to the priest who ministers the Sacrament: Distribute this gift with much care. There is no small punishment for you, if being conscious of any wickedness in any man, you allow him to partake of the banquet of the table."** The saint understood that the Eucharist creates actual unity, declaring: "We become one Body, and members of His flesh and of His bones...let us be blended into that flesh."

## St. Ignatius of Antioch on episcopal commemoration

As the earliest witness to the Church's understanding of episcopal authority and eucharistic unity, St. Ignatius of Antioch provided foundational teaching that shaped all subsequent Orthodox theology. Writing to the Magnesians, he commanded: **"Study to do all things with a divine harmony, while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place of the assembly of the apostles, along with your deacons, who are most dear to me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ."**

Ignatius established the principle of eucharistic validity depending on episcopal authority: **"Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it...It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast."** This teaching directly connects to the question of heretical commemoration—if the Eucharist requires legitimate episcopal authority, then commemorating heretical bishops undermines the very foundation of sacramental validity.

The saint's warnings against schism were absolute. To the Trallians, he wrote about those who "seem worthy of trust whilst they teach the doctrine of Jesus Christ," but "mingle Jesus Christ with their own poison." He commanded: **"I therefore, yet not I, but the love of Jesus Christ, entreat you that ye use Christian nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a different kind; I mean heresy."**

## Other Church Fathers on this theological principle

St. Maximus the Confessor provided perhaps the most dramatic testimony during his trial in 655 AD for refusing communion with Monothelite heretics: **"Even if the whole universe holds communion with the Patriarch, I will not communicate with him. For I know from the writings of the holy Apostle Paul: the Holy Spirit declares that even the angels would be anathema if they should begin to preach another Gospel, introducing some new teaching."** His stance established that sacramental communion must be preceded by doctrinal orthodoxy.

Theodore the Studite, writing during the Iconoclast controversy, explicitly forbade communion with heretical bishops in his Letter 380 to Naukratios (818 AD): **"You must never accept anything they say uncritically, and neither should you enter into dialogue with heretics, which is something contrary to apostolic counsel."** He taught that "truth does not grow together with falsehoods, as tares do with wheat," making any spiritual communion with iconoclasts dangerous to Orthodox faith.

St. Mark of Ephesus, the sole Eastern bishop to reject the false union of Florence, declared on his deathbed: **"I do not desire, in any manner and absolutely, and do not accept communion with him [the Patriarch] or with those who are with him, not in this life nor after my death."** His Encyclical Letter (1440) explained the theological reasoning: **"Let no one dominate in our faith: neither emperor, nor hierarch, nor false council, nor anyone else, but only the one God, Who both Himself and through His Disciples has handed it down to us."**

Augustine of Hippo addressed the question of sacramental validity and heretical ministers, while Photius of Constantinople wrote in his Encyclical to the Eastern Patriarchs (866) that the faithful should not participate in communion with those who "introduce some new teaching," declaring that even "the least departure from Tradition can lead to a scorning of every dogma of our Faith."

## The principle that liturgical commemoration expresses and creates ecclesial communion

Orthodox theology understands koinonia (communion) as encompassing both vertical relation with God and horizontal bonds linking all faithful across time and space. This communion is fundamentally trinitarian in nature and represents actual participation in divine life through the Eucharist, not merely human fellowship. As Nicholas Afanasiev, who first coined "eucharistic ecclesiology," taught: "Wherever there is the Eucharist, there is the Church."

The theological foundation rests on several interconnected principles. First, commemoration actualizes unity by making present the eschatological reality of the Church as the Body of Christ. Second, it transcends temporal and spatial limitations, linking each local eucharistic assembly with the universal Church across all ages. Third, it manifests communion by demonstrating sacramental solidarity with those commemorated. The Formula of Hormisdas (519), signed by 2,500 Eastern bishops to end the Acacian Schism, explicitly stated: **"I promise that from now on those who are separated from the communion of the Catholic Church, that is, who are not in agreement with the Apostolic See, will not have their names read during the sacred mysteries."**

Alexander Schmemann emphasized that the Eucharist is not merely a means of grace but the very event from which every Church member derives their identity. The liturgical ordo reveals the Church's true nature, with worship determining theology rather than vice versa. When names are read from the diptychs during the anaphora, this liturgical action creates real spiritual bonds that constitute the Church's very being.

## Historical applications of this principle

The Church has consistently applied these theological principles throughout history, demonstrating their fundamental importance to Orthodox faith and practice. The Acacian Schism (484-519) provides the earliest major example. When Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople supported Emperor Zeno's Henoticon, which compromised Chalcedonian Christology, Pope Felix III excommunicated him. Acacius immediately struck Felix's name from his diptychs, creating a 35-year schism resolved only when Eastern bishops signed the Formula of Hormisdas acknowledging the necessity of orthodox commemoration.

During the Monothelite controversy, St. Maximus the Confessor refused communion with heretical bishops despite imperial pressure, torture, and exile. His position was vindicated by the Sixth Ecumenical Council (680-681), which condemned Monothelitism and posthumously anathematized several patriarchs who had compromised. The Iconoclastic periods (726-787, 814-843) saw Orthodox bishops consistently refuse to commemorate iconoclastic patriarchs, viewing such commemoration as complicity in heresy. St. Germanus of Constantinople was deposed for refusing to reject icons, while Theodore of Stoudios wrote extensive defenses during the second period.

The Great Schism of 1054 crystallized around liturgical commemoration. Pope Sergius IV's name was removed from Constantinople's diptychs, possibly over the Filioque. When Cardinal Humbert excommunicated Patriarch Michael Cerularius, the Patriarch immediately removed the Pope's name from the diptychs and excommunicated the papal legates. This established the lasting precedent that liturgical commemoration equals ecclesiastical communion, with the diptychs serving as "a visible sign of the unity of the Church."

St. Mark of Ephesus's refusal to sign the false union of Florence (1439) demonstrated individual application of this principle. As the only Eastern bishop to reject the union, he explicitly refused future communion with those who signed, understanding that it would create communion with heretical Latin teaching. Modern examples include the Old Calendarist schisms (1924-present), where traditionalists broke communion over calendar reform, arguing that innovation was symptomatic of "the pan-heresy of ecumenism," and ROCOR's 80-year refusal to commemorate Soviet-era Moscow Patriarchs, demonstrating that commemoration would imply complicity in collaboration with atheist authorities.

## The distinction between material and formal cooperation

Orthodox canon law, while less systematically codified than its Western counterpart, distinguishes between levels of participation in heresy. **Formal cooperation** involves deliberate participation in heretical teaching or worship with full knowledge and consent, while **material cooperation** refers to participation that may appear to endorse heresy but lacks the intention to do so.

Apostolic Canon 45 states that clergy who pray with heretics should be excommunicated, while the Council of Laodicea's Canon 33 prohibits receiving blessings from heretics. However, the Orthodox Church applies the principle of oikonomia (pastoral discretion) in addressing complex situations. The Church recognizes different degrees of involvement: mere attendance at heterodox services, active participation in prayers or responses, receiving sacraments from heretical ministers, and liturgical concelebration with heretical clergy.

Theodore Balsamon ruled that "Imprisoned Latins and others coming to our Catholic churches request communion of the Divine Sacraments" should be refused unless they first "resolve to depart from Latin dogmas and customs and shall be catechized." This demonstrates that even well-intentioned participation requires proper theological understanding to avoid material cooperation becoming formal endorsement of heresy.

## Orthodox eucharistic ecclesiology and its implications

The Orthodox understanding of eucharistic ecclesiology creates a framework where communion is created through liturgical action, theological integrity must be maintained, pastoral flexibility applies through oikonomia, and an eschatological perspective governs all decisions. This explains why Orthodox churches exercise such care regarding commemorations—they understand that liturgical actions have real theological consequences, creating communion that extends beyond symbolic recognition.

John Zizioulas's synthesis integrates Christological-Pneumatological unity, recognizing that the Eucharist requires both Christ's institution and the Holy Spirit's epiclesis. The bishop serves as necessary president of the eucharistic assembly, linking local and universal dimensions, while the Eucharist itself represents the eschatological anticipation of the Kingdom where the paradox of "One and Many" is resolved.

Modern Orthodox practice must balance fidelity to canonical tradition, pastoral concern for the faithful, ecumenical dialogue opportunities, and protection of Orthodox theological integrity. When determining whether liturgical commemoration is appropriate, the Church considers whether it explicitly endorses heretical teaching, creates scandal by suggesting doctrinal agreement, undermines the integrity of Orthodox faith, or violates canonical prohibitions. While the Church may pray for those in error, this does not imply theological agreement or sacramental communion.

The consistent witness of the Church Fathers, the historical application of these principles across centuries, and the theological framework of eucharistic ecclesiology all demonstrate that liturgical commemoration creates real sacramental unity. Therefore, attending liturgies where heretical bishops are commemorated makes participants complicit in their errors, not through mere association but through actual spiritual communion. This understanding preserves the integrity of Orthodox faith while maintaining the eschatological hope for the ultimate unity of all in Christ's Kingdom.
