# The Kollyvades movement: From persecution to vindication in Orthodox history

The Kollyvades movement of 18th-century Greek Orthodoxy was systematically persecuted by church hierarchy for opposing liturgical innovations, yet their leaders were eventually canonized as saints and their theological positions became mainstream Orthodox teaching. Their story offers striking parallels to modern controversies over ecumenism and tradition.

The movement arose on Mount Athos in 1754 when monks opposed transferring memorial services from Saturday to Sunday for commercial convenience. Led by Saints Nikodemos the Hagiorite (1749-1809), Makarios of Corinth (1731-1805), and Athanasios Parios (1722-1813), the Kollyvades defended traditional Orthodox practices against Western Enlightenment influences. Their opponents initially dismissed them as rigorists and troublemakers, but history vindicated their theological positions. The movement's eventual triumph—from excommunication in 1776 to patriarchal endorsement in 1819 and ultimate canonization—demonstrates how ecclesiastical authorities can persecute genuine Orthodox tradition before recognizing its validity.

## Memorial services and the theology of resurrection

The Kollyvades controversy began over what seemed a minor liturgical issue but revealed profound theological principles. In 1754, monks at the Skete of St. Anne on Mount Athos moved memorial services from Saturday to Sunday so they could attend Saturday markets in Karyes to sell handicrafts and purchase building materials.

St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite articulated the theological opposition to this practice with careful distinctions. He differentiated between simple commemorations during the Divine Liturgy's Proskomide, which involved no mourning, and memorial services "with kollyva" that included "mourning and wailing." The kollyva (boiled wheat) itself carried deep symbolism: **"The kollyva symbolizes the dead human body, which awaits the Resurrection."** This symbolism made Saturday appropriate for memorials, as it liturgically represents death and awaiting resurrection, while Sunday celebrates the joy of Christ's resurrection.

St. Athanasios Parios supported this position by citing the Apostolic Constitutions: "He who is gloomy on the day of the Lord shall be guilty." The Kollyvades argued that ancient tradition excluded "funerary memorial prayers for the departed" from Sunday worship precisely because it contradicted the day's resurrectional character. Even Patriarch Theodosios II acknowledged in 1772 that Saturday memorials conformed to "ancient tradition," though he attempted reconciliation by declaring Sunday memorials also permissible.

## Frequent communion and the democratization of holiness

The Kollyvades' advocacy for frequent Holy Communion challenged prevailing Orthodox practice where most Christians communed only 2-3 times yearly, ostensibly to avoid dishonoring the sacrament through unworthiness. The movement published "Concerning Divine Communion" (1777), likely authored by Neophytos of Kafsokalyvia and edited by Saints Makarios and Nikodemos.

St. Nikodemos presented compelling theological arguments from this work. He emphasized communion's necessity: **"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you."** He reasoned that just as baptism occurs once but is necessary for spiritual life, communion must occur "frequently and daily" to sustain that life. When Christ instituted the Eucharist, Nikodemos noted, He commanded rather than recommended: "Take, eat; this is My body" and "This do in remembrance of Me."

Most revolutionary was their teaching that **"Divine Communion is not a reward of the perfect, but a strengthening of the imperfect in their spiritual struggle."** This democratized access to the sacraments, challenging a spirituality that had become increasingly monastic and elite. The Kollyvades also opposed other liturgical laxities including kneeling on Sundays (forbidden by canon law as inappropriate to the day of resurrection) and various innovations in icon sanctification and excommunication practices.

## Accusations of rigorism and systematic persecution

The Orthodox hierarchy's response to the Kollyvades escalated from mockery to murderous persecution. The very name "Kollyvades" began as a derisive epithet, sarcastically labeling them as obsessed with memorial wheat. They faced multiple accusations that reveal the establishment's hostility.

Church authorities labeled them as **"rigorists," "troublemakers," and "innovators"**—the last charge particularly ironic since they sought to restore ancient practices. Some opponents spread bizarre rumors that they were "Masonic spies" or that they "put Communion in their skufos for later." The most serious charges came at official synods. Patriarch Samuel I Chatzeres issued a Synodal Encyclical in 1773 directing monks to follow local monastery policies, which became the basis for declaring dissenters anathema. The 1774 Synod at Koutloumousiou Monastery, attended by two former Patriarchs and multiple bishops, formally anathematized those rejecting the 1773 encyclical.

The decisive blow came at the **1776 Synod of Constantinople under Patriarch Sophronios II**. This synod, attended by the Patriarch of Jerusalem and sixteen hierarchs, excommunicated the movement's leadership including St. Athanasios Parios (who was "condemned as a heretic, defrocked, and excommunicated"), Neophytos Kavsokalyvites, and St. Nikodemos himself. The synod declared memorial services could be held either Saturday or Sunday and forbade further discussion.

## Murder, exile, and institutional violence

Beyond ecclesiastical censure, the Kollyvades faced physical violence. The most shocking incident occurred in 1773 when anti-Kollyvades monks from the Skete of St. Anna hired a Turkish bandit captain named Markos to murder four Kollyvades fathers. The monks convinced Markos these were "Masonic spies and were not in fact monks," paying him **seven hundred silver coins**.

Markos succeeded in drowning Saints Theophanes and Paisios "at the beach of New Skete, during the vigil of the Sunday of All Saints." When Mount Athos authorities questioned why he murdered "monks known for their virtue and holiness," Markos realized his deception and returned to threaten the Skete of St. Anna with destruction unless paid ten purses of silver.

The persecution scattered the Kollyvades across the Greek world. Many fled Mount Athos for "Hydra, Patmos, Ikaria, Sciathos, Chios and elsewhere." Neophytos Kavsokalyvites spent most of his remaining life in exile, teaching in schools from Chios to Bucharest, "excluded from later interaction with his former companions." This diaspora, while painful, helped spread Kollyvades teachings throughout the Orthodox world.

## Vindication through patience and providence

The Kollyvades' vindication came gradually but decisively. Initial relief arrived in 1781 when Patriarch Gabriel IV found charges against Athanasios Parios "absurd and unfounded," restoring his priestly rank. Patriarch Neophytos VII declared St. Nikodemos's views "dogmatically sound" in 1802. **The Holy Community of Mount Athos formally vindicated the Kollyvades on May 19, 1807**, condemning their accusers.

Full ecclesiastical endorsement came in 1819 when a Council at Constantinople under Patriarch Gregory V (later martyred and canonized) endorsed frequent communion. The Patriarch wrote that "Communion should not be received at certain set times, but whenever one felt himself ready for it, following confession and other necessary preparation."

The canonizations represented ultimate vindication. **St. Nikodemos was canonized on May 31, 1955** by the Ecumenical Patriarchate, 146 years after his death. **St. Athanasios Parios followed in 1995**, with the Holy Synod of Greece concurring. Their primary work, the Philokalia, compiled by Saints Nikodemos and Makarios in 1782, became "the principal spiritual text for all the Eastern Orthodox churches." Metropolitan Kallistos Ware called it a spiritual "time bomb" whose influence came "not at the moment of its first publication... but two hundred years later."

## Orthodox theology vindicates traditional "strictness"

Modern Orthodox theologians provide sophisticated justifications for the Kollyvades' positions, centering on the distinction between **akrivia** (exactness in following church law) and **economia** (discretionary leniency). Fr. George Metallinos, in "I Confess One Baptism," argues the Kollyvades were "outstanding experts in Patristic theology and Church history" whose positions were "well-grounded historically and theologically."

The theological defense rests on several principles. First, the Kollyvades preserved Orthodox identity against Western corruption. Constantine Zalalas contrasts their "Scriptural and Theocentric" viewpoints with opponents' "anthropocentric and humanistic" mindset. They "wanted to counter the hypertrophic rationalism of the Enlightenment with the mystical experience of Orthodoxy."

Orthodox scholars draw explicit parallels to contemporary ecumenical controversies. Metallinos connects Kollyvades baptismal theology to modern debates: **"If one accepts a heretical baptism as valid in and of itself, he accepts also the priesthood of the clergyman who administers it, and ultimately the Eucharist that such a clergyman celebrates, too. Such is the path of ecumenical dialogue."**

The pattern of accusations against the Kollyvades—legalism, innovation, causing division—mirrors charges against modern anti-ecumenical movements. Just as 14th-century scholastics accused hesychasts of being "modernists," the anti-Kollyvades accused traditionalists of innovation. Modern Mount Athos theologians and movements like "Orthodox Ethos" explicitly invoke Kollyvades principles in opposing syncretistic ecumenism.

## Conclusion

The Kollyvades movement demonstrates how genuine Orthodox tradition can face severe persecution from ecclesiastical authorities before eventual vindication. Their story—from mockery and murder to canonization and theological triumph—offers crucial lessons for contemporary Orthodox facing similar controversies over tradition and accommodation.

What began as a dispute over memorial services revealed deeper conflicts between authentic Orthodox spirituality and Western-influenced innovations. The Kollyvades' insistence on frequent communion, proper liturgical observance, and patristic tradition seemed rigid to contemporaries but proved prophetic. Their theological positions, once grounds for excommunication, now represent mainstream Orthodox teaching.

For modern Orthodox grappling with ecumenical pressures and accusations of fundamentalism, the Kollyvades provide both precedent and hope. Their patient endurance through persecution, combined with rigorous theological argumentation, offers a model for defending tradition without descending into sectarianism. As their eventual canonization demonstrates, what one generation condemns as dangerous rigorism, history may recognize as the preservation of authentic faith. The Kollyvades remind us that **orthodoxy often appears as extremism to those who have drifted from tradition**, but time and providence vindicate those who hold fast to the apostolic deposit.
