# Byzantine Liturgical Separation During Iconoclasm: Primary Source Documentation

The iconoclastic periods of 726-787 and 814-842 witnessed unprecedented liturgical separation as Orthodox Christians refused communion with bishops who supported imperial iconoclasm. Extensive primary source evidence documents systematic patterns of separation at every level of Byzantine society, from patriarchs to laypeople, with particularly detailed records from monastic communities who preserved both the practice and theological justification for refusing liturgical participation under heretical hierarchs.

## The First Iconoclastic Period: Patriarchal defiance and monastic resistance

When Emperor Leo III issued his iconoclastic decree in 726, **Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople** became the first documented case of high-level liturgical separation. According to Theophanes the Confessor's Chronicle and contemporary letters, Germanus refused to accept the imperial decree and resigned in 730 rather than participate in iconoclastic liturgies. His correspondence before resignation describes "whole towns and multitudes of people in considerable agitation," documenting widespread popular refusal to accept iconoclastic bishops, particularly those under Constantine of Nakoleia and Thomas of Klaudioupolis.

The Council of Hieria in 754 marked a turning point in resistance patterns. While 338 bishops attended under "severe imperial pressure," many later admitted participation under duress. **St. Stephen the Younger**, abbot of Mt. Auxentius monastery in Bithynia, emerged as the leader of monastic resistance. The Life of St. Stephen and Theophanes' Chronicle document his explicit refusal to accept Hieria's decisions or receive communion from iconoclastic bishops between 754-764. His stance cost him imprisonment on Proconnesus Island in 762 and eventual martyrdom in 764.

Mt. Olympus in Bithynia became a major center of organized resistance. **St. Theosteriktos (Theocteristus)**, abbot of Symbola Monastery, led systematic refusal of communion from the iconoclastic hierarchy. On Holy Thursday during Constantine V's reign, Governor Michael Lachonodrakon attacked the monastery, arresting 38 monks. Theosteriktos had his nose cut off and was imprisoned in Constantinople alongside St. Stephen the Younger, according to Orthodox martyrologies and hagiographical sources.

The geographic scope of separation extended beyond Byzantine control. The patriarchs of Alexandria (Cosmas), Antioch (Theodore), and Jerusalem (Theodore) "broke communion with the Iconoclast Patriarch of Constantinople and his bishops," maintaining communion with Rome instead. Palestinian monasteries, protected by Islamic rule, continued orthodox liturgical practices throughout the period.

## Theodore the Studite and the Second Iconoclasm

The second iconoclastic period (814-842) produced more detailed documentation through the extensive correspondence of **St. Theodore the Studite** (759-826). George Fatouros's critical edition contains over 550 letters detailing Theodore's theology of separation. His Letter 380 to Naukratios (818 CE) provides explicit instructions: "You must never accept anything they say uncritically, and neither should you enter into dialogue with heretics, which is something contrary to apostolic counsel."

Theodore's systematic approach extended beyond direct iconoclasts to include **"commemorators"** - orthodox priests who mentioned iconoclastic patriarchs in liturgical commemorations. He developed a three-tier principle of culpability: direct heretics (iconoclastic bishops), commemorators (orthodox priests who commemorated them), and participants (those receiving communion from commemorating priests). This created comprehensive separation from the official church hierarchy.

Under **Patriarch Theodotus I Melissenos** (815-821), Theodore commanded his monks to process through the monastery vineyard on Palm Sunday 815, "holding up icons visibly over the walls" in direct provocation. Following the iconoclastic synod of April 815, Theodore was exiled to Metopa fortress but maintained his correspondence network, calling on "all, near and far" to revolt against iconoclastic decisions.

The Chronicle of Theophanes Continuatus documents Theodotus as "torturing by starvation at more than one iconodule abbot in an attempt to force them into agreement." Under **Patriarch Antony I Kassimatas** (821-837), described as "an iconoclast because of ambition," separation continued throughout orthodox communities. Antony was "later anathematized the Orthodox synodika" after his death.

## Theological foundations for separation

Theodore the Studite provided sophisticated theological arguments grounding liturgical separation in fundamental Christology. His position held that iconoclasm constituted heresy because it denied Christ's true incarnation - if Christ could not be depicted, then either his human nature was unreal or his divine and human natures were separated. This made communion with iconoclasts equivalent to denying core Christian doctrine.

**John of Damascus** had earlier established the incarnational basis: since God became visible in the Incarnation, Christ could and should be depicted. Theodore expanded this through letters to Pope Paschal I (817), arguing that rejecting icons was equivalent to rejecting the Eucharist, since both involved sanctification of matter through divine presence. He consistently chose **"akribeia"** (canonical strictness) over **"oikonomia"** (pastoral accommodation), arguing that doctrinal purity required uncompromising separation.

The Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea (787) preserve records of bishops who had refused participation in iconoclastic liturgies seeking restoration. Richard Price's 2018 translation documents the restoration process, where bishops who had participated under duress were allowed to remain after public confession. The council records show how those who maintained separation were vindicated while compromisers required penance.

## Canon 15 and retroactive justification

The **First-Second Council of Constantinople (861)**, presided over by St. Photios the Great, produced Canon 15, which retroactively justified iconoclastic-era separations. The canon states that those "who, on account of some heresy condemned by holy Synods, or Fathers, withdrawing themselves from communion with their president, who, that is to say, is preaching the heresy publicly, and teaching it bareheaded in church, such persons not only are not subject to any canonical penalty...but, on the contrary, they shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians."

This established crucial distinctions: separation was justified only when bishops "openly proclaimed a heresy already condemned by a Synod," not based on personal accusations or suspicions. The concept of **"walling off"** from manifest heretics provided canonical framework for legitimate resistance while maintaining orthodox continuity. Those who separated "have defied, not Bishops, but pseudo-bishops and pseudo-teachers."

## Local clergy caught between orthodoxy and hierarchy

Particularly complex situations arose when local clergy remained personally orthodox but were required to commemorate iconoclastic patriarchs during liturgy. Many chose to cease liturgical functions entirely rather than mention heretical hierarchs in the diptychs - the liturgical lists commemorating church leaders. The removal of names from diptychs implied accusations of heresy, making commemoration a public declaration of communion.

**Abbot Leontios** of Studion exemplified internal struggles during Theodore's exile. He initially "adopted the iconoclast position and won over many individual monks" but was "eventually won back to the iconodule party." The martyrdom of **Studite monk Thaddaios** (816-819) motivated "a number of bishops and abbots at first willing to reach a compromise" to renounce iconoclastic positions.

Underground liturgical practices developed throughout the empire. Studite monks performed liturgies privately when official churches were controlled by iconoclasts, using panel icons as altars in ordinary houses. They maintained separate sacramental life from the official hierarchy while developing alternative networks for orthodox communion.

## Regional variations and consequences

Separation patterns varied significantly by region. Constantinople's monastic communities, particularly Studion under Theodore, showed strongest resistance. Southern Italy and Sicily became refuges for fleeing iconophile monks and clergy. Cyprus and peripheral regions maintained continuous icon veneration. The monastery of St. Catherine in Sinai, under Islamic protection, preserved the largest collection of early icons.

Consequences for separatists were severe. Theodore the Studite suffered three exiles (797, 809-811, 815-820) and multiple floggings. **Joseph the Studite** was stripped of his archbishopric for refusing Christmas liturgy with iconoclasts. **Naukratios** faced imprisonment and interrogation by Patriarch John VII the Grammarian. Countless unnamed monks endured imprisonment, torture, and exile.

The restoration under Empress Irene (787) and definitively under Empress Theodora (843) vindicated separatist positions. The "Triumph of Orthodoxy" on March 11, 843, when **Patriarch Methodius I** led a procession restoring icons, validated the theological and canonical arguments for separation. Methodius "disposed of and replaced a great number of iconoclast bishops," completing the restoration of orthodox hierarchy.

## Conclusion

Primary sources from both iconoclastic periods reveal systematic liturgical separation as a defining feature of orthodox resistance. From Patriarch Germanus's resignation in 730 to Theodore the Studite's elaborate correspondence network, Byzantine Christians developed sophisticated theological and canonical frameworks justifying refusal of communion with heretical hierarchs. The documentation shows clear patterns: patriarchs who resigned rather than compromise, monks who chose martyrdom over communion with iconoclasts, and laypeople who maintained underground liturgical life. Canon 15 of 861 crystallized these experiences into lasting canonical principle, establishing that those who "wall off" from manifest heretics deserve honor rather than penalty. This Byzantine precedent created enduring Orthodox teaching that ecclesiastical obedience never supersedes doctrinal orthodoxy, and that separation from heretical hierarchy, even when costly, preserves rather than breaks true ecclesial communion.
