BASIL THE GREAT
Basil the Great initially describes the state of the Church during that period as follows:
“This is the thirteenth year since the heretical war has arisen against us, during which more afflictions have occurred in the Churches than at any time since the Gospel of Christ began to be proclaimed. I refrain from recounting every detail to you, lest the weakness of my words diminish the vividness of the evils. Besides, I do not consider you in need of instruction, as you have already long been taught the truth of the matter through common report.
The heart of the problem is this: the people, abandoning the houses of prayer, gather in the deserts. It is a pitiful sight—women, children, the elderly, and the otherwise infirm suffering outdoors under heavy rain, snowstorms, winds, and winter frost, as well as in summer under the burning sun. And all this they endure because they refuse to accept the evil leaven of Arius.”
(Basil the Great, Epistle 242, To the Westerners)

In another letter, the saint writes:
“What afflicts us is well known, even if we do not speak of it. For it has spread throughout the entire world. The doctrines of the Fathers are despised, apostolic traditions are disregarded, and the inventions of modern men now dominate Church life. So people now use rhetoric instead of theology; the wisdom of the world takes precedence, pushing aside the glory of the cross.
True shepherds are expelled, and in their place come savage wolves who tear apart the flock of Christ. Houses of prayer are deserted by worshippers; deserts are full of lamenting voices. The elders mourn, comparing the past with the present; the youth are even more pitiful, unaware of what they have been deprived of.
These things are enough to move to compassion those who have been educated in the love of Christ. Yet, even when the truth is spoken, it still falls far short of the reality.”
(Basil the Great, To the Most Holy Brothers and Bishops in the West, Epistle 92)

A third description from the saint helps us understand how the Orthodox of that time refused all communion with heresy and heretics:
“The doctrines of true piety have been overturned, and the Church's institutions are in confusion. Ambitious men who do not fear the Lord seize power, and the episcopate has become a reward for open blasphemy—so that the one who speaks most impiously is more likely to be appointed bishop. The dignity of the priesthood has vanished; shepherds who used to care for the flock with knowledge have abandoned their roles.
Resources for the poor are squandered on personal pleasures and bribes for those who love power. The exactness of canonical observance has been obscured; there is great license to sin. Those who gained authority through human schemes now make up for their lack of true merit by indulging sinners. Just judgment has perished; everyone follows the desires of their own hearts. Wickedness is without measure, the people are without guidance, and their leaders speak with no boldness. For they have become slaves to those who gave them their power…”
(Basil the Great, Epistle 92, To the Italian and Gallic Bishops)

Basil also writes in his letter to monastics, as transmitted by Saint Mark of Ephesus:
“Those who pretend to confess the sound Orthodox faith but continue to commune with the heterodox—if they do not separate from them after being warned—should not only be excluded from communion, but should not even be called brothers.”
(Saint Mark of Ephesus, Confession, citing Basil the Great)

It is clear, then, that the Orthodox stance toward heretical bishops and clergy was one of complete separation. This confirms that distancing oneself from any heresy or heretic is part of the sacred Tradition.
In another part of the same letter, the saint writes:
“But that man has already given the clearest evidence of his entire life by his present decision—that he never truly lived in hope of the promises reserved for us by the Lord. Rather, if he ever practiced anything concerning religion—whether words of faith or displays of piety—it was all done with the intent to deceive his audience.
But why should this trouble you? In what way have you become worse because of this? One person has withdrawn from your community. And if another, or even a second, has followed him, they are to be pitied for their fall, while your body remains whole through the grace of God. For what was useless has been removed, but what remains has not been mutilated.
And if it grieves you that you have been expelled from the church buildings, you will lodge instead under the protection of the God of heaven, and the angel assigned to the Church has departed with you. Thus, the buildings are left empty each day, while the scattering of the faithful brings severe judgment upon those who caused it.
And if there is labor in this situation, I am convinced by the Lord that it will not be in vain for you. The more trials you endure, the greater reward you should expect from the righteous Judge. Therefore, do not resent the present troubles, nor grow weary in hope.”
(Basil the Great, Epistle 238, To the Presbyters of Nicopolis)

Here, the saint speaks about those who betrayed the faith and entered into ecclesiastical communion with heretics. He says they have departed, but the Body of Christ remains intact and unharmed. The phrase “what was useless has been removed, but what remains has not been mutilated” is particularly vivid and unique in its clarity, expressing that no matter how many may depart from Orthodoxy through heresy, the Body of Christ remains whole, unharmed, and unbroken.
What is most important in this reference is that, while the heretics departed from Orthodoxy through their heresies, they remained within the church buildings and, with the help of the political authorities, appointed heretical bishops. Then, the Orthodox withdrew from the churches and gathered in the forests and mountains. The angel of the Church also departed from the buildings occupied by the heretics and went instead to the wilderness—where the Orthodox were gathered.

And here is one final excerpt from among the many relevant passages in the letters of this great Father of Caesarea:
“Only, do not be deceived by their false claims of professing the true faith. Such men are traders of Christ, not Christians—preferring always what is profitable in this life over the life of truth. When they thought they had secured that empty position of authority, they aligned themselves with the enemies of Christ. But when they saw the people rise in resistance, they reshaped themselves again to appear orthodox.
I do not recognize such a person as a bishop, nor would I count him among the priests of Christ—one who, through the impure hands of the ungodly and for the purpose of destroying the faith, has been appointed as protector.
This is my judgment. But if you share any part with us, surely you will agree with us. If you choose otherwise, everyone is master of their own opinion. We are innocent of this blood.
I have written these things not because I doubt you, but to strengthen any who might be uncertain—by revealing my own view—so that no one may later be admitted into communion, nor even receive the laying on of hands from such persons, and then, once peace has returned, try to number themselves among the ranks of the clergy.”
(Basil the Great, Epistle 240, To the Presbyters of Nicopolis)

In this passage, the saint vividly describes the heretical bishops, calling them "Christ-merchants" who reshape themselves depending on the moods of the people. He does not even consider them bishops, since—as he states—they were ordained “for the destruction of the faith.” Basil places the responsibility for preserving the true faith and Orthodox teaching squarely on each Orthodox believer.
Here we also see the deceit and hypocrisy of heretical bishops, and the role of the people as guardians of the faith.

It is especially noteworthy and shows the saint’s extreme strictness on matters of faith, what he states at the end:
“So that certain persons may not be accepted into communion, nor even those who have received the laying on of hands from them—lest, once peace is restored, they force themselves into being counted among the ranks of the clergy.”
Here, the saint forbids the Orthodox from receiving—even after reconciliation and the return of Orthodoxy—those who had been ordained by heretics and later repented and sought to return to the Orthodox Church in their clerical role.
