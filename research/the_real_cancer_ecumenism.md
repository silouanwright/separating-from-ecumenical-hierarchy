Introduction
«No, we cannot go, because, Papism and the Pope are not prepared. They have too much egotism. Not only do they
wish to subject us to themselves and Papism, but they also do not believe that we have the truth. There is no need
for us to go. We can help the situation better with our prayers»1
.
This answer came from both Saint Paisios of Mount Athos and Saint Porphyrios, without having any communication
with each other, because they were guided by the spirit and by God. It was the response to the “Pope” at that time,
who, having been informed about the existence of these Holy elders and about the influence which they had on the
Orthodox people desired to meet them. He sent some people to feel them out and see if indeed they wished to visit
with him. Surely, this meeting was impossible2
. This ecumenist act is typical of the head of the Papacy.
To briefly define Ecumenism, the following can be sufficient: “It is a movement, which proclaims that its purpose is
to unify the divided Christian world (Orthodox, Papists, Protestants, etc.). This idea of unification moves every
sensitive Christian soul and resounds its innermost desires. This is precisely the idea that Ecumenism has also
appropriated. But this unifying vision – a par excellence spiritual vision – is mainly reliant on human efforts and not
the energy of the Holy Spirit”3
.
However, “we know well from history and from our own present-day experience that the Pope does not wish for a
real union of the Churches on the basis of Divine truth, but a subjugation of Orthodoxy to his primacy. This had been
his insatiable desire all along. He has always seen union as the acceptance on our part of his primacy”4
. The Roman
Catholic Ecumenism is directed to uniting all the rest of the Christians under the Pope as the Head of all Christian
bodies5
. This cancer, Ecumenism, is spread not only among heretics but also in our own Orthodox Church.
Ecumenism Starting Point and the opposition of the fathers in the Holy Mountain
The leadership of Orthodox Ecumenism was assumed around 1963 by the Patriarch of Constantinople Athenagoras
I6
. However, this “was not the beginning of Orthodox Ecumenism. The beginning of the active participation of the
Orthodox Church in the Ecumenical Movement dates from 1924. That year the Patriarch of Constantinople Meletios
Metaxakis introduced the Gregorian, Papal, or ‘New’ Calendar into the Church of Constantinople. And through his
maneuvering he had it introduced also into the Church of Greece. This was a politically motivated innovation”7
.
Going back to Athenagoras, his actions resulted in a cease of commemoration in the Divine liturgies on the Holy
Mountain. “The prevailing view here as elsewhere on the Mountain was that he had proved clearly by his words and
his deeds that he was no longer an Orthodox Christian, and hence he should not be commemorated”8
. When asked
about the Patriarch, Father Vissarion of the Monastery of Grigoriou, replied: “I do not approve it at all, and have
written him pleading that he stop it, because it involves performing acts that are contrary to the holy canons of our
Church and making pronouncements that imply apostasy from the Orthodox Faith. Others on the Holy Mountain
have written similar letters. But he does not answer any. We for our part have ceased commemorating him at the
Divine Liturgy”9
. In a 1967 issue of the periodical of the monastery, Vissarion says: “The Holy Mountain is today in
agony and in a state of commotion from one end to another, as a result of the rash leaps of the Patriarch. We mean

his declarations that ‘nothing separates us from the Latins’, that ‘the dogmas will be placed in the store-room’, that
‘the union will take place and let the Theologians continue their dialogues’, and that Theology equals love’; and what
is most shocking of all, that fact that he has been taking part in prayers and Doxologies with non-Orthodox and allows
them to bless the Orthodox faithful as if they (the non-Orthodox) were Orthodox clergymen, thereby trampling upon
the Holy Canons”10
. A proclamation was stated by Archimandrite Gabriel (Monastery of Dionysiou) in the periodical
“Hagiorite Library” which goes by the title “Proclamations of Hagiorite Fathers to the Orthodox Greek People” and
states: “The Hagiorite Fathers – Abbots, Hieromonks, and Monks – […] having learned of the recent machinations
against our Orthodox Faith by the Papal Insurrection and the unionist slogans of the Ecumenical Patriarch and his
collaborators, proclaim with a stentorian voice that we denounce such unionist slogans and unionist tendencies, and
abide firm and unshakable by our Orthodox Faith, following what has been prophesied by the God-inspired Prophets
and has been taught by the Heralds of God, the Apostles, by the God-bearing Choir of Fathers, by the Seven
Ecumenical Synods and by the Local Synods, having as our head the Corner-stone Christ, our God, in a word abiding
by all that our Orthodox Faith teaches, either through writing or through Tradition, and rejection ‘Union’ or ‘Unity’,
as the unionists lately have been calling it. If the Catholics and the other heterodox want to return to Orthodoxy, let
them come themselves repenting and asking for compassion, espousing fully the dogmas and the Tradition of our
blameless Orthodox Faith. It is not proper for us the Orthodox to run to them. We make an appeal to the Ecumenical
Patriarch to stop his unionist activities, for if he continues them we shall disavow him [...]“11
.
Ecumenism, the Canons and the Holy Fathers
A succinct, but categorical statement by St. Vincent of Lérins gives us a preliminary interpretation of the strict stand
of the Holy Fathers, regarding the subject of communion with those who are not Orthodox in their beliefs. What is
St. Vincent’s message? “To preach any doctrine other than what has been handed down, never was lawful, never is
lawful, and never will be lawful”12
13
.
The Patriarch’s “initiatives involved the Orthodox Church in the Ecumenical Movement in ways clearly forbidden by
the Holy Canons of our Church. He removed the Pedalion, the Rudder, from the ship of Orthodoxy, and thus let this
ship be blown hither and thither by the winds of heterodox groups, particularly the Roman Catholic Church. Thus,
we have been witnessing joint prayers – called ‘Ecumenical Prayers’
– with the heterodox, including the Pope
himself, in which leading Orthodox churchmen, including the Patriarch of Constantinople, participate”14
.
Concerning the Holy Canons disregarded by the Orthodox ecumenists back then and till the present day, let us quote
the 45th and the 65th Apostolic Canons. The 45th says: “Let any Bishop, or Presbyter, or Deacon that merely joins in
prayer with heretics be suspended, but if he permitted them to perform any service as Clergymen, let him be
deposed”15
. The 65th says: “If any Clergyman, or Layman, enter a synagogue of Jews, or of heretics, to pray, let him
be both deposed and excommunicated”16
.
“The intent of these Canon is to protect the Orthodox Faith from any kind
of relativistic misunderstanding. When we pray together with others, it is essentially presupposed that the others
with whom we pray have precisely the same Faith that we have – the same beliefs regarding the nature of God,
man’s nature and destiny, the paths and means of attaining salvation. When we pray with persons whose Faith is
different from ours, it means that we slight our Faith, that we do not consider it of any real consequence, that we
have a relativistic view of truth, a view which is alien to the Orthodox Church. The Canons were formulated and
instituted not out of hatred for non-Orthodox Christians or for the Jews. The true Orthodox, as true followers of

Christ, love all men, they hate none. They are free both from the vice of religious intolerance, and from that of
indifference to their Faith, the Truth”17
.
“Ecumenism is not simply and solely a canonical irregularity, but bears directly on the ecclesiological foundations of
the Most Holy Orthodox Church”18. Now, what are the most fundamental principles of Orthodox ecclesiology? They
are the following:
“First Principle: There is One and only one true Church, which is ontologically identical with the Orthodox Church;
every other Christian community, which is not identical or unified in faith with Orthodoxy, is heretical and outside
the domain of the Truth and the Church. In this regard, St. Photios the Great is very clear:
«There is one Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ, not many, not even two; gatherings other than this are
synagogues of wicked men and an assembly of dissenters; thus do we the true Christians think, thus do we believe,
thus do we proclaim»19
.
Second Principle: Only inside the One and only Church, that is, the Orthodox Church, is salvation in Christ unfailingly
bestowed, because only She (the Church) is the Body of Christ, and only those who are members of His Body can be
in communion with Her Head, which is Christ. St. John Chrysostomos is categorical on this subject:
«For if ‘we are the Body of Christ and severally members thereof’, and in this way He is our Head, He cannot be the
Head of those who are not in the Body and do not rank among the members»20”21
.
The ecumenists, in their attempt to delineate the ecclesiological nature of heterodox communions, have formulated
a package of theological notions, whereby they accept the “ecclesiality” of the different Christian bodies; that is,
they acknowledge that the heterodox are within the “boundaries” of the Church22
. From the most important notions,
we state the following23:
1-
“Baptismal theology”, which maintains that baptism – Orthodox and heterodox – supposedly delimits the
Church, establishing the so-called “baptismal boundaries” of the Church, and that, in this way, She includes
Orthodox and heterodox, who are held together by the “baptismal unity” of the Church24
.
Here are some typical views:
In 1995, Patriarch Bartholomew, during his visit to the Vatican, co-signed a “Joint Communiqué” with the
Pope, which, among other things, proclaimed:
“We exhort our faithful, Catholic and Orthodox, to strengthen the spirit of brotherhood, which derives from
a single Baptism and participation in the sacramental life... They [viz. the Pope and the Patriarch] included
in their prayers all those who are incorporated into Christ on the basis of their Baptism...”25
.
In 1987 another Patriarch proclaimed the following, wholly officially and publicly, at an ecumenist assembly:

2- “We are all [viz., Orthodox and heterodox] members of Christ, a single and unique body, a single and unique
‘new creation’, since our common baptism has freed us from death”26
.
The theology of “Sister Churches”, according to which Orthodox and Papists are supposedly “Sister
Churches” in the full sense of that term, despite existing dogmatic differences; indeed, the Orthodox
ecumenists are already extending the term “Sister Churches” to other heterodox communions, too27
.
The ecumenists’ actions are obviously in opposition to the Apostolic, Patristic, and Synodical Tradition of Orthodoxy,
which loudly and clearly commands, not only in the words of St. Basil the Great, that we “avoid communion with the
heterodox”28, but through St. Maximos the Confessor, instructs us thus: “I wish you to reject with all your might all
those who do not accept the pious and saving dogmas of the Church”29
. “Let him [who is weak in Faith] shun”,
exhorts St. John Chrysostomos, “let him shun contact with heretics, and let him turn away from their gatherings, lest
the pretext of friendship with such people become an occasion for him to lose his faith”30
. In another place, the Holy
Father again insists: “Let us repudiate gatherings of heretics, let us cleave unceasingly to the right Faith, and let us
display an upright life and conduct that are equal to what we teach”31. Indeed, so great is the care and scrupulosity
of the Holy Fathers on questions of relations with heretics, that St. Theodore the Studite declares: “Very great are
the threats voiced by the Saints against those who compromise with it [i.e., heresy], to the point of eating together;
Even if he [viz., one who appears to be Orthodox] accommodates himself to heretics in food, drink, and friendship,
he is guilty; this is the judgment of Chrysostomos and, hence, of every Saint”32
.
The Ecumenical initiatives of Patriarch Athenagoras (...) at once evoked strong reactions against them, and soon
divided the Orthodox into two opposite camps: the Ecumenists and the Anti-ecumenists. (...) Regarding the split, a
great Confessor of the Orthodox Faith, Photios Kontoglou, wrote in a letter to Metropolitan Iakovos of Derkon – a
ranking member of the Synod of Constantinople – that the attempt of Athenagoras to approach the Vatican has
served as a signal for the separation of the “sheep” from the goats (Matthew 23: 33), the believers from the
unbelievers – persons of the little faith or individuals who only pretend to be believers33
.
Ecumenists have absolutely no idea that they are “engaging in warfare against the Fathers and against God, as St.
Theodore the Studite says: ‘We do not understand the words of the Saints, and as a result we are found waging
warfare against the Fathers or, rather, against God’34”35
. We address an anguished question, stemming from
brotherly love to the ecumenists among us Orthodox: Whither go ye, O Orthodox ecumenists?36
The perverse actions of the ecumenists
By means of countless dogmatic and canonical coups, since 1920 the ecumenists have been shifting and gradually
destroying, one by one, the “eternal boundaries” of the Patristic Orthodox Tradition. Let us get involved in several
26 Episkepsis, No. 370 (January 15, 1987), pp. 8-13 [in Greek].
27 Patriarch Bartholomew, for example, stated in 1993 that Orthodoxy and Anglicanism are “Sister Churches” and
have a common responsibility “in the universal Church” (see Episkepsis, No. 499 [December 31, 1993], p. 6 [in
Greek]: “The Oecumenical Patriarch Visits the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Synod of Anglican Bishops” [This

definite and firm “steps” taken by the ecumenist Patriarchs of Constantinople and the other Bishops of the Phanar,
in particular towards heretical Papism, always, of course, in the context of the “contemporary ecumenical activity of
the local Orthodox Churches”37
38
.
1- 2- 3- 4- They lifted the anathemas of 1054 against Papism (December 7, 1965)39
.
They proclaim that there are no substantial differences between Orthodoxy and Papism.
a. Patriarch Athenagoras (†1972) made this revealing statement: “During the nine hundred years that
have passed since 1054, we, the two worlds of East and West, have come to think that we belong
to different Churches and to different religions. Consequently, the purpose of dialogues become
clear: to prepare our peoples psychologically to accept that there is one Church and one
religion...”40
.
They regard the Pope as the “First Bishop of Christianity”.
a. Patriarch Demetrios (†1991), for example, declared, in his “Message” to Pope Paul VI (dated
December 3, 1977), on the twelfth anniversary of the lifting of the anathemas: “Along with this
blessing, we are sending Your Holiness as a very small expression of love, fraternal honor, and our
recognition of your august person as the first Bishop of worldwide Christianity, a vigil-lamp which
has been kept burning in our private Patriarchal Chapel, so that it might be placed in your private
chapel, to show that ‘the light of Christ illumines all’”41
.
They correspond with the Pope as if he were a Bishop “in communion with them”, with every ecclesiastical
formality.
a. b. Patriarch Athenagoras, for example, wrote to Pope Paul VI on November 22, 1963: “To Paul, the
Most Blessed and Most Holy Pope of the Elder Rome, greetings in the Lord... In sending timely
congratulatory salutations and heartfelt wishes, in a fraternal spirit, to your Holiness on the
occasion of your election and appointment, by the good will and Grace of God, to the ancient
Throne of the Elder Rome..., we pray once more that Your Holiness may ever enjoy good health
and illustriously preside over the most Holy Church of the Elder Rome for as many years as
possible... The beloved brother in Christ of your Holiness, who is held in esteem and affection by
us, Athenagoras of Constantinople”42
.
Patriarch Demetrios wrote in a similar vein to Pope Paul VI on December 7, 1975: “To Paul, the
Most Blessed and Most Holy Pope of the Elder Rome, greetings in the Lord... Sharing in such
fraternal sentiments and edifying pronouncements with your Holiness, first in the rank and honor
in the universal Body of the Lord, we embrace you with a holy kiss, and we remain, with fraternal

love and especial honor, the beloved brother in Christ of your most esteemed Holiness, Demetrios
of Constantinople”43
.
c. Finally, Patriarch Bartholomew wrote to Pope John Paul II on June 21, 1993: “To John Paul II, the
Most Holy and Most Blessed Pope of the Elder Rome, greetings in the Lord. During the present
year, ‘we have desired with desire’ (St. Luke 22: 15) to concelebrate with your Holiness, who is held
in love and affection by us, the Patronal Feast of your Church of Rome... Hoping and praying that
this new and festal meeting of our Churches may be blessed abundantly by the Lord, we
congratulate you on this auspicious day, and we remain, with immutable fraternal sentiments in
Him, the beloved brother in Christ of Your esteemed Holiness, Bartholomew of Constantinople”44
.
5- 6- They visit heretical Rome as if they were visiting an Orthodox Patriarchate45
.
They pray together with the Pope and exchange the kiss of peace in the midst of the Liturgy.
a. At the Patronal Feast of Constantinople (November 30, 1979), for example, “...at the Divine Liturgy,
His Holiness, the Pope, approached...and stood with all the members of his entourage... The Pope
was led to a specially prepared Throne opposite the Patriarchal Throne, from which he watched
the Divine Liturgy with reverence. At ‘Let us love one another’, the Pope descended from his Throne
and the Patriarch came out of the Holy Altar and they exchanged the kiss of love in Christ to the
applause of the entire congregation. The Pope recited the Lord’s Prayer in Latin46
.
7- They bless Orthodox congregations jointly with the Pope and his representatives.
a. At the Patronal Feast of Constantinople (November 30, 1979), after the dismissal of the Divine
Liturgy, at which Pope John Paul II was present, engaging in joint prayer, the Patriarch and the
Pope addressed each other and exchanged gifts; and “next [the choirs] chanted the Polychronia of
the two Primates, who gave each other the kiss of peace and blessed the crowds”, and then
“ascended the outer staircase, from the top of which they blessed the applauding crowds and
entered the Patriarchal residence”47
.
8- They celebrate Doxologies in honor of the Pope inside the Patriarchal Church.
a. During his visit to the Phanar, for example, Pope John Paul II “went to the Patriarche, where he
was given an official welcome according to Patriarchal protocol and was present at the Doxology
celebrated in his honor in the Patriarchal Church”; and finally, “the whole ceremony concluded with
the Polychronia of the two Primates, the mutual kiss of peace, and the blessing which they imparted
to the congregation”48
.
9- They chant Polychronion to the Pope publicly and “in Church”49
.
10- They commemorate the Pope in the Diptychs of the Divine Liturgy.
a. Patriarch Athenagoras, addressing himself to Pope Paul VI in his letter for the Feast of the Nativity,
in 1968, said: “In this communion (of the love of Christ), celebrating with the company of the most
holy and most honorable Metropolitans around me, we will commemorate your precious name in
the Diptychs of our heart, O most holy brother Bishop of the Elder Rome, before the holy offering
of this precious Body and this precious Blood of the Savior in the Divine Liturgy of our most holy

predecessor, the common Father of us all, John Chrysostom. And we will say on this holy day of
the Nativity before the holy Altar, and we say to you: May the Lord God remember thine Episcopacy,
always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages”50
.
11- They welcome Papist bishops enthusiastically and are blessed by them.
a. In 1965, for example, a Pontifical delegation under Cardinal Bea visited the Phanar (April 2-5). On
April 4, they went to the Halki School, where the Rector, Bishop Andrew of Claudioupolis,
addressed the Cardinal, concluding with these words: “For this reason, we chant with all our
hearts: ‘Hosanna! Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord’”! The Cardinal then preached
a lengthy and didactic sermon to the students, and, at the end, “the pupils of the School lined up
in front of the Cardinal and received his blessing”!51
12- They allow Papist bishops and other clergy to be present at, and engage in, joint prayer at the
Enthronements of Orthodox Hierarchs52
.
13- They send congratulations on the elections, anniversaries, birthdays, and promotions of Popes and other
Papist bishops.
a. On September 9, 1993, for example, Metropolitan Maximos of Sardis wrote to the newly-elected
Pope Paul VI, conveying, among other things, the congratulations of Patriarch Athenagoras: “By
august command, I convey with reverence to Your Holiness the warm congratulations and heartfelt
wishes of His Most Divine All-Holiness, that Your esteemed Holiness may offer long and fruitful
service in our Holy Sister, the Roman Church...”53
.
b. On June 20, 1969, Patriarch Athenagoras sent a telegram to Pope Paul VI, on the anniversary of his
election: “On the occasion of the great event of the enthronement of Your beloved and esteemed
Holiness, we cordially congratulate you, and we beseech our Lord, that He grant you long years,
full of health, for the good of His whole Church”54
.
c. In 1977, Patriarch Demetrios sent a message of good wishes to Pope Paul VI, “on the occasion of
his eightieth birthday”: “Rejoicing and prayerfully celebrating the birthday of Your Most Blessed
Holiness and your reaching and important stage in your life, which has been entirely dedicated to
the Lord, to His Gospel, to His Church, and to the service of mankind”55
.
d. On October 16, 1979, Patriarch Demetrios sent a telegram to Pope John Paul II, “on the first
anniversary of his election”: “With profound fraternal love and joy we rejoice in the completion of
the first year of your radiant Episcopacy on the Throne of Rome...”56
.
14- They compose special prayers and send them to the Pope, so that he can recite them officially at ceremonies
and presentations.
a. As proof of this, we cite the “Set of Prayers and Meditations Inspired by the Meaning of the Divine
Passion”, which Patriarch Bartholomew composed in 1994, “at the request” of the Pope, “for the
customary procession of the ‘Way of the Cross’ (Via Crucis) at the Colosseum, on the evening of
Good Friday, led by the Roman Pontiff”57
. Much was written about the significance of this

the occasion of the Good Friday service at the Colosseum in Rome”58
.
They accept that Papism is a “Sister Church”, which possesses “all that Christ entrusted to His Church”59
.
It is evident that all of these citations fit the precise meaning of dogmatic syncretism, through which a full equation
of Papists and Orthodox ecumenists has been achieved in practice; and all this on the basis of a theology that was
established, and is being developed and continually upheld, out of conviction60
.
How is it that Orthodox ecumenists overlook the fundamental ecclesiological truth that all members of the Church,
in a certain way, constitute a continuous Synod of the People of God – since “‘Church’ is the name of an assembly
or synod”, according to St. John Chrysostomos61, which “is the champion of the Faith”62, guards “the Faith which was
once delivered”63, and has the right and the duty to judge synodal decisions? How do they forget the teaching of St.
Basil the Great, that ‘...the administration of the Churches is carried on by those to whom the chief offices in them
have been entrusted, but their hands are strengthened by the laity’64?”65
We, the faithful laity, are protectors of the Faith. In the Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs, 1848, it was written:
“Moreover, neither Patriarchs nor Councils could then have introduced novelties amongst us, because the protector
of religion is the very body of the Church, even the people themselves...”66
. By examining ourselves, are we reacting
and fighting against any Anti-Patristic actions?
The Elderly Bishop Gregory of Nazianzos, once and without full awareness, signed a heretical confession67
. Therefore,
the following questions are posed68:
1- 2- 3- If, at that time, the pious Priests and monastics, “the more fervent part of the Church”, broke communion
with him, what should we do today, when Orthodox ecumenists have signed heretical texts, not once, but
many times?
What should we do today, when they have transgressed the Canons, not once, but many times?
Finally, what should we do today, when these innumerable falls occurred not without full awareness, but
have been the products of deep conviction?

Let us take a few examples of steadfast persistence, based on conviction, in the principal heretical notion of the
ecumenists, that Orthodoxy and heresy supposedly co-exist within the boundaries of the Church.
1- The first major ecumenist text, the Synodal Encyclical of 1920, regards the totality of “the different Christian
Churches,” that is, Orthodox and heterodox, as “the whole Body of the Church”69
.
2- In 1967, during his visit to the Vatican, Patriarch Athenagoras co-signed with Pope Paul VI a “Common
Statement”, in which it was proclaimed that the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church were
able “to re-discover each other as Sister Churches”70
.
3- The previous Patriarch, Demetrios, repeatedly characterized Papism as the “Sister Church of Rome”71 and
very clearly expressed his attitude towards ecclesiology when he stated in 1979—while welcoming the Pope
to the Phanar—that their meeting had broader significance than “that of the meeting of two local bishops”;
“we regard it,” he said publicly, “as the meeting of the Churches of West and East”72
.
4- The Balamand Union, 199373
.
5- Finally, the present Patriarch, Bartholomew, fully embraces – and in 1995, at the Vatican, officially
proclaimed – the theology of “Sister Churches”, with particular reference to Papism and Orthodoxy74
.
Before moving towards the Balamand Union, it is important to note that the lives of the Saints are always trustworthy
guides in theory and in practice, for the Orthodox. Our Holy Father St. Mark of Ephesus (reposed on June 23, 1445)
stated categorically that he did not want, by any means whatsoever or in any way at all, to have communion with
the then Latin-minded Patriarch Gregory (Gregory III Mamas, 1443-1450) or with any who had communion with him,
who by their unionist and pro-Papal policy were working “to destroy the correct dogmas of the Church”75
.
It is noteworthy that the Saint did not want to have communion with them, not only as long as he was alive, but not
even after his repose-neither at his funeral, nor subsequently at his memorial services! Let us marvel at these
ipsissima verba of the Saint’s legacy:
“I neither desire”
, this Atlas of Orthodoxy declares, “nor accept communion with him [i.e., the Latin–minded
Patriarch] or his lackeys, in any manner whatsoever, whether during my lifetime or after my death”; “just as
throughout my life I was separated from them [viz., the Latinizers], so also at the time of my departure from life, and
even after my death, I reject communion and union with them; and I adjure, I command, that none of them approach
either at my funeral or at memorial services for me, nor even those of anyone else belonging to our faction, so as to
attempt to associate and concelebrate with our clergy. For this is to mix what cannot be mixed. For it is necessary
that they [viz., the Latinizers] be completely separated from us, until God grants the good amendment and peace of
His Church”76
.
The Saint’s language is severe and uncompromising. Now, why is this so? How did he justify this absolute position of
his towards the Latin–minded unionists of his age who, it should be noted, had not yet been suitably judged by an
69 Great Protopresbyter George Tsetsis, The OEcumenical Throne and the Oikoumene: Official Patriarchal Texts [in
Greek] (Katerine: Tertios Publications, 1988), pp. 59 and 62.

Orthodox synod and who at that time constituted the so–called “official Church”? Let us hear, then, how the Saint
explains his position, with marvelous precision and theological clarity77:
“For I am absolutely convinced that the more I distance myself from him [i.e., the Latin–minded Patriarch] and those
like him [the unionists], the closer I draw to God and all the faithful and Holy Fathers; and to the extent that I separate
myself from these people, even so am I united with the truth and the Holy Fathers and theologians of the Church”78
.
According to the Saints, therefore, separation from heretics means rapprochement and union with God, the Truth,
and the Fathers79
.
The Balamand Union
We return to the critical text of the Balamand Union80:
In June (17–24) of this year [1993 back then], the 7th Plenary Session of the “Joint International Commission for
Theological Dialogue” between Orthodox and Papists convened in Balamand, near Tripoli, North Lebanon, at the St.
John of Damascus Orthodox Theological School, which is located near the Patriarchal Monastery of Our Lady of
Balamand (12th century).
Twenty-four Papists and 13 Orthodox, representing only 9 of the 15 Orthodox Churches, took part in the sessions
(present: Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, Russia, Romania, Cyprus, Poland, Albania, and Finland; absent:
Jerusalem, Serbia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, and the Czech and Slovak Republics). The copresidents were
Archbishop Stylianos of Australia and Cardinal Edward Cassidy, and the joint secretaries were the ecumenist
Metropolitan Spyridon of Italy, for the Orthodox, and Father Jozef Maj, for the Papists81
.
The Joint Commission dealt with the theological and practical questions that have arisen because of the existence,
as well as the pastoral activity, of the Uniate communities which have been recently revived in Central and Eastern
Europe. To this end, the commission elaborated upon a text that had been prepared by a joint co-ordinating
committee in June 1991, in Ariccia (Rome), with the title “The Unia, a Past Method of Union, and the Present Search

for Full Communion”82
, following the disputes about the Unia that had occurred earlier in Vienna (January 1990)83
and in Freising (Munich) (June 1990)84
.
The definitive text of Balamand, consisting of thirty-five paragraphs and occupying nearly five pages of A4 [standard
European paper, slightly longer than the standard 8 1/2 x 11 American stationery], contains:
1- an Introduction (§§ 1–5),
2- 3- an exposition of Ecclesiological Principles (§§ 6–18),
a statement of Practical Rules (§§ 19–35),
and fulfills two goals: the complete overturning of Orthodox Patristic ecclesiology and the acceptance of a Papist
interpretation of the so-called Uniate Churches (...). In concrete terms, through the approved text of the 7th Plenary
Session at Balamand (apart from other absurdities), the following Completely Anti-Orthodox ideas are upheld:
1- “Catholics and Orthodox…are once again discovering each other as Sister Churches” (§ 12) and “recognizing
each other as Sister Churches” (§ 14)85
.
a. The ecumenists, Orthodox and Papist alike, here explain the real meaning of the theology of “Sister
Churches,” which is certainly not understood as a polite expression, but as a fundamental
ecumenist ecclesiological category or idiom. Let us review certain of their statements in
chronological order, statements which cannot be misinterpreted, since they speak for themselves.
October 26, 1967. Patriarch Athenagoras to Pope Paul VI in St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome: “With
such emotion we give You the kiss of the love and peace of the Lord Jesus, and we offer You our
profound honor. We are especially fortunate to be doing this, not simply and solely to the honored
Hierarch of Rome, bearer of apostolic grace and successor of a multitude of holy and wise men,
who occupies this throne that is first in honor and rank in the company of Christian Churches
throughout the world…”86
.
b. December 7, 1975. Patriarch Demetrios to Pope Paul VI on the tenth anniversary of the lifting of
the anathemas: “To Paul, the Most Blessed and Holy Pope of the Elder Rome, greetings in the
Lord…. In this very Word of God, the Holy Church of Christ in Constantinople embraces the Bishop

of Rome and the Holy Church in Rome, in the incense, acceptable to the Lord, of the pentarchy of

in love and honor, ascribing all honor to Your Holiness, in accordance with that definition…. Sharing
in such fraternal sentiments and edifying pronouncements with Your Holiness, first in rank and
honor in the universal Body of the Lord, we greet You with a holy kiss…”87
.
c. June 5, 1990. Father Demetrios Salachas, member of the Papist Commission on Catholic-
Orthodox Dialogue: “And the two Churches, as they engage in dialogue, are conscious of their
identity, their ecclesial nature and their sacramental structure: the Catholic Church, as much as the
Orthodox, believes unswervingly and is profoundly aware that they continue the undivided Church,
that is, that in them there subsists the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church”88
.
d. June 29, 1990. Metropolitan (now Patriarch) Bartholomew to Pope John Paul II at the Patronal
Feast of Rome: “It is commonly recognized today that ‘the solutions of the future are found
elsewhere’: in the model of ‘Sister Churches,’ within the context of the eucharistic ecclesiology of
communion”89
.
e. June 5, 1991. Pope John Paul II in Bialystok, Poland: “They [Orthodoxy and Papism] are Sister
Churches, not in the sense of a polite expression, but in the sense of a fundamental, ecumenical
ecclesiological category, on which the mutual relations of all Churches must be based”90
.
f. June 29, 1991. The same Bartholomew of Chalcedon to the same Pope, and again at the Patronal
Feast of Rome: With historic changes, especially in the last two years, “opportunities for
coöperation have been created for the common witness and a deeper unity of our Sister
Churches…. Your Holiness, on the occasion of the Patronal Feast of the Church of this historic city
over which you gloriously preside, the delegation of the OEcumenical Patriarchate congratulates
Your Holiness and with You ‘all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints’ and adds, with
Paul: ‘Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ’ (Romans 1:7)”91
.
g. December 5, 1992. Metropolitan Damaskenos of Switzerland, “Chief Secretary for the
Preparation of the [so called Eighth] Holy and Great Synod of the Orthodox Church”: “What is
missing [in the relations between Catholics and Orthodox] is an appropriate outlook, that is to say,
the thing that would allow us to overcome our problems. This means that, as long as those
participating in a dialogue of love and official theological dialogue discover once again the truth
that we are Sister Churches, as long as we are ready to recognize one another as ‘Churches’ in the
full sense of the word ‘Church,’ and as long as we mutually lift the Anathemas—then we shall, on
such grounds, bring the theological and ecclesiological consequences of this discovery to bear on
a local and global level. This, however, has not come to fruition”92
.
h. July 20, 1993. Father Demetrios Salachas, papal representative at Balamand: “In reality ‘Sister
Churches’ means a recognition of the ecclesial nature and sacramental structure of each church,

see Katholike, no. 2573 (July 24, 1990), Fr. Demetrios Salachas: “In the New Situation of the Churches in Eastern
and Central Europe, the Model of ‘Sister Churches’ is the Only Solution to the Question of Union”

Salvation,” at an academic ceremony where he was awarded the “Abt Emmanuel Heufelder” prize for distinction in
ecumenism at the Papist Monastery of Niederaltich (Benedictine Monks).

2- 3- in the sense that each, in and of itself, provides the means of grace and salvation”93
. Related to the
theology of the “Sister Churches” and synonymous with it, but also elucidative of it, is the theology
of the “two lungs” and the “double tradition” (Eastern and Roman/Latin), on the basis of which the
Papists hold out vigorously against the abolition of the Unia.
i. December 7, 1991. The Pope, at an ecumenical ceremony in St. Peter’s: “Catholicism and
Orthodoxy constitute in reality the two lungs of the Christian heritage of a United Europe”94
.
j. Cardinal Achilleo Silvestrini, president of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Catholic
Churches: “The Church of Christ breathes with her two lungs, the Eastern and the Western”95
.
k. December 1991. The same Cardinal Silvestrini at the Synod in Rome: He chimed in with his
homily, the subject of which was, “The Heritage of the Eastern Churches: an Essential Element in
the Fullness of Christian Tradition,” and put forth the reasons why “he judged the existence of
Churches of the Eastern tradition within the Catholic Church indispensable”96
.
l. February 1993. Patriarch Bartholomew: Orthodoxy and Papism “constitute the two lungs of the
Body of Christ”97
.
“On each side, it is acknowledged that what Christ has entrusted to His Church—profession of apostolic
faith, participation in the same sacraments, and above all, the one priesthood celebrating the one sacrifice
of Christ, the apostolic succession of bishops—cannot be considered the exclusive property of one of our
Churches” (§ 13).
a. The Orthodox ecumenists no longer believe in the soteriological and ecclesiological exclusivity of
Orthodoxy as the One and Only Church of Christ, especially when we take into account the fact
that in Vienna, in 1990, they agreed unanimously with the Papists on the following astounding
point: “In no way should we espouse any kind of soteriological exclusivity, nor should a narrow
confessional interpretation be given to the expression extra ecclesiam nulla salus (“outside the
Church there is no salvation”). Such soteriological exclusivity clashes with the ecclesiology of Sister
Churches”!98
“All rebaptism is proscribed” (§ 13)99
.
a. The “theology of return” is rejected, that is, the theology of calling the heterodox Papists into the
One and Unique Baptism of Orthodoxy: “The new ecclesiological basis of communion, which the
two Churches have embraced in their dialogue, dictates that they both reject the ‘theology of

94 Katholike, no. 2635 (January 7, 1992), p. 6. These words were spoken during the extraordinary Synod of the
Papist Bishops of Europe, in Rome.
95 Katholike, no. 2643 (March 3, 1992), p. 1: “The Two Lungs of the Church of Christ.” • These statements of
Cardinal Silvestrini were made in a French periodical, where he acknowledged the great concern of his special
Synod for the Eastern Catholics (Uniates): “The Orthodox Church reacts against them en masse, but we hope that
these reactions will be diminished or obliterated with the mellowing of time and the mutual respect of Catholics
and Orthodox”!
96 Katholike, no. 2635 (January 7, 1992), p. 4: “Double Tradition is Indispensable in the Church.” • This foregoing
statement of Cardinal Silvestrini is a hermeneutical key to the “Balamand Union,” as will become fully
comprehensible from what follows.
97 The Orthodox Church [OCA] (February 1993), p. 6. • Patriarch Bartholomew referred likewise to the
“fundamental ecclesiological truth” of the “two lungs” in his address to Cardinal Edward Cassidy at the Patronal
Feast of the Phanar on November 30, 1992 (see Ekklesia, no. 1 [January 1–15, 1993], p. 14).

Publications, 1993), p. 65 [emphasis ours].
99 This clause, which comes exactly at the end of § 13 of the Balamand Text, is missing from the English text. What
does this mean? But even if it is not in the definitive text, however, this exclusion of all “rebaptism” derives from
the contents of § 13 of the Balamand Agreement and from the rejection on both sides of ecclesiological and
soteriological exclusivity.

4- 5- 6- 7- return’”100
. At the same time, however, the Orthodox ecumenists reject the very broad Patristic
and Synodal consensus—which has expressed the self-conception of the Orthodox Church for
almost ten centuries—, that the Latins are “heretics,” “unbaptized,” “in need of Baptism,”101 and
that “those who return from the Latins should be Baptized, unquestionably, indispensably and
necessarily”102
.
The so-called Oriental Catholic Churches [the Joint Commission carefully avoided the apparently problematic
term “Uniate Churches”] are a “part of the Catholic Communion” and “have the right to exist and to respond
to the spiritual needs of their faithful” (§3).
a. This declaration indicates that the Orthodox Church “recognizes the Catholic Church in her entirety
as a Sister Church, and indirectly recognizes also the Oriental Catholic Churches,”103 and
consequently the Uniate Churches are now “Sister Churches” in the full sense of the term! That is
to say, the Uniates emerged from the “Balamand Union” with greater rights to existence and
activity than those that were foreseen by the decree “Orientalium ecclesiarum” of Vatican II,
insofar as they will exist with the approval of the Orthodox and will be considered “Sister
Churches”!
The so-called Oriental Churches, i.e., the Uniates, “should be fully incorporated… into the dialogue of love…,
and should also enter into theological dialogue with all of the functional rights that accrue thereto” (§§ 16,
34).
The local Orthodox and Catholic pastors are asked to avoid misunderstandings and suspicions, to organize
their pastoral activities jointly, to consult, communicate and work with each other, respecting each other’s
authority, which was given to them by the Holy Spirit, and to take turns in using common places of worship
(§§ 24, 29, 28).
Special attention should be given on both sides to the preparation and education of future priests with
regard to this “new ecclesiology,”104 so that they may “be informed of the apostolic succession of the other
Church and the authenticity of its sacramental life,” and so that “the use of history in a polemical manner”
may be avoided” (§ 30).

This Balamand Agreement accomplished the complete overthrow of Orthodox Patristic ecclesiology, since – for the
first and primary reason – polyheretical Papism was recognized as literally constituting a “Sister Church” and as
possessing “all that Christ entrusted to His Church”105
.
For the second reason, with the Balamand Union, the Uniate communities were indirectly recognized as “Sister
Churches”, since they are in communion with Papism and have the right to exist and carry out their activities; indeed,
they are urged “to incorporate themselves fully” “into the dialogue of love” and “to enter (and take part in) the
theological dialogue”106
.
Anti-Ecumenism focal points and the Holy Fathers
We can no longer tolerate the inter-Christian and interfaith syncretism of ecumenism, even though an oligarchy of
Orthodox ecumenists persists in alienating itself ecclesiologically. Many countries have pointed out their opposition
to this cancerous movement and we cite the following:
1- The first focal point of anti-ecumenism is Serbia. In May of 1995, a momentous “Report” by His Eminence,
Bishop Artemije of Rashka and Prizen to the Holy Synod of the Serbian Church on the subject of ecumenism
sparked a flare-up of anti-ecumenism in Serbia. This truly historic “Report”, entitled ‘The Serbian Orthodox
Church and the World Council of Churches”,
a. Characterizes the WCC as a “pseudo-ecclesiastical organization”,
b. Points out that the first Orthodox Church to succumb to ecumenism was the Patriarch of
Constantinople, through its Encyclical of 1920;
c. Maintains that ecumenism has infiltrated Orthodoxy and is devouring it from within like a
“cancerous tumor”;
d. states that, through ecumenism, “the boundaries which our Holy Fathers established between truth
and falsehood, light and darkness, Christ and Belial, have been breached”;
e. and proposes, finally, that the Serbian Church withdraw from the WCC and all similar
organizations107
.
In March of 1996, the same Bishop, in an official document, asserted publicly that “OEcumanical Patriarch
Bartholomew and those with him have trampled underfoot all of the Sacred Canons and Traditions of the
Church beyond measure, in an effort to implement their ecumenist and expansionist ideas”108
.
In May of 1996, the Holy Synod examined Bishop Artemije’s “Report” in detail and appointed a committee
of four Hierarchs to study the issue and make any pertinent recommendations109
.
In May of 1997, the Serbian Hierarchy discussed the subject of ecumenism and participation in the WCC in
a tense atmosphere; it took into consideration a strongly anti-ecumenist “Appeal” by 340 Serbian clergy
and monastics, as well as the findings of the committee of Hierarchs, which clearly advocated, with
documentation, the withdrawal of the Serbian Church from the WCC; in the end, the Hierarchy decided to
call for the convocation of a pan-Orthodox consultation to look into the matter110
.

2- 3- 4- 5- In the same year, the Serbian Bishop of Budapest, Daniel, stated that “it is impossible for us to fulfill the
true mission of Orthodoxy unless we leave this movement”, that is, the ecumenical movement111110110
above.
The second focal point of anti-ecumenism is Russia. With loud voices, clergy and laity, but particularly
monastics, as well as many theologians, are calling the Moscow Patriarch to leave the WCC and to cease
participating in the heretical ecumenical movement. Amid this climate, in 1994, the Theological Commission
of the Russian Church proposed to the Holy Synod that their Church withdraws from the WCC and other
ecumenical organizations. In December of 1994, the Holy Synod of the Russian Hierarchy rejected the
proposal of the Theological Commission, but began to evince an attitude of grave skepticism towards the
WCC and the ecumenical movement112
. The number of calls to withdraw from the WCC has grown within
the Russian Church113 and the majority of Church people now regard ecumenism as signifying “something
dangerous and utterly unacceptable”114. In the end, the emergence of a very broad and powerful anti-
ecumenist current inside Russia forced the Moscow Patriarch, like the Serbian Church, to propose the
convocation of a special pan-Orthodox consultation to ease tensions.
The third focal point of anti-ecumenism is Georgia. In April and May of 1997, a chain on the part of monastic
brotherhoods in Georgia, who broke communion with the Patriarchate on account of ecumenism, led the
Orthodox Church of Georgia to a truly historic decision to end its participation in the ecumenical movement
and its institutions. In particular, the Holy Synod of the Church of Georgia, on October 8, 1998, made the
following decisions, among others115:
a. The joint texts of the dialogue between the Orthodox and the Monophysites (or Non-
Chalcedonians) are unacceptable.
b. c. The joint text of the Balamand meeting of the Orthodox-Roman Catholic dialogue is unacceptable.
The celebration of Pascha according to the Papal Calendar, which is observed by the Orthodox
Church of Finland, is unacceptable.
d. The doctrine that heterodox communities constitute branches of the true Church of Christ and
possess the Divine Mysteries, is un-Orthodox, heretical, and unacceptable.
e. Joint prayers and sacramental communion with the non-Orthodox are unacceptable.
As you can understand, the paramount importance of these decisions by the Georgian Church is
so obvious that any commentary would be superfluous.
The fourth focal point of anti-ecumenism is Bulgaria. On April 9, 1998, the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian
Hierarchy decided to discontinue its participation in the WCC for good116
.
We will conclude our survey of anti-ecumenism with Greece. In December of 1994, the Permanent Synod
of the Church of Greece, when informed about the text of this “Balamand Agreement”, officially expressed
a strong reaction to its ecclesiological deviations, regarding “the text of Balamand concerning the Unia as
unacceptable from an Orthodox point of view” and “as completely alien to the age-old Orthodox
Tradition”117. It is noteworthy to mention important statements and actions of an anti-ecumenism

character on the part of His Beatitude, Christodoulos, the new Archbishop of the State Church, and by the
Permanent Holy Synod under him, have created a particularly satisfying impression:
a. In an interview on May 24, 1998, he made the following explicit and categorical statements:
“Ecumenism, according to the prevailing definition of this term, is certainly a heresy, because it
entails a rejection of basic features of the Orthodox Faith, as would be the case, for instance, if we
were to accept the Branch Theory. We believe that Orthodoxy is the One, Holy, Catholic, and
Apostolic Church- period; and this point is not up for discussion; consequently, anyone who
believes to the contrary can be called an ecumenist and, therefore, a heretic”118
.
b. The Permanent Holy Synod, at its recent session of the 141st convocation (August 26-27, 1998),
endorsed – among other things – three clearly anti-ecumenist actions on the part of its president,
Archbishop Christodoulos, which he had undertaken with synodal authorization119:
i. He responded negatively to Cardinal Francisco Arinze, “President of the Pontifical Council
for Interfaith Dialogue of the Roman Catholic Church”, who had invited the Church of
Greece to appoint delegates to an “interfaith Assembly” (Rome, October 24-29, 1999):
“The Church of Greece declares that she cannot take part in interfaith assemblies of this
kind, owing to resolutions that have been made on this subject by the Holy Synod of our
Church”120
.
ii. He sent a reply to the president of the “Council of Catholic Societies in the Church of
England”, in which he explained why the Church of Greece had decided to curtail its
dialogue with Anglicanism, “on account of the extreme deviations” of the Anglicans “from
Biblical and Patristic Tradition”.
iii. He responded negatively to Patriarch Teoctist of Romania, who had invited the Church of
Greece to an international interfaith meeting, “Peoples and Religions” (Bucharest, August
30-September 1, 1998): “The Most Holy Church of Greece will not take part in the
international meeting in question, owing to binding decisions that have already been
made by the Holy Synod not to participate in interfaith prayers and ceremonies which are
inconsistent with Orthodox ecclesiology and canonical order, so as to avoid scandalizing
the flock”121
.
By looking at all things the ecumenists are doing, it is clear that “they are ‘disobedient to the will of God’ and will be
completely alienated from the unity of the Faith and the Holy Fathers, as long as they continue [to flirt with heretics
and] to remain organic members of the WCC and to overlook the incontrovertible fact that this organ of the
ecumenical movement, prior to the deadlock over [the] union in the Truth, thoroughly institutionalized confessional
differences and promoted de facto a syncretistic ‘model’ of union based on service in the diversity of faiths”
. In view

and 5).
120 Strangely, the Permanent Holy Synod decided to appoint Mr. G. Martselos, professor at the Theology School of
the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, as an observer at the interfaith meeting to be held in Rome in the
month of October. It was said that this was necessary in order to avoid creating the impression that the Church’s
position is unvaryingly reactionary, marginal, and, supposedly, inspired by extremist, fanatical ideas. See
Έχχλησιαστιχή Άλήθεια [1-16 April 1999], p. 14.
121 “Unfortunately, all of the other Orthodox Churches took part, either through their Primates or through
representatives. But when the Church of Georgia saw that she had been caught in a trap, she had the courage to
withdraw, denouncing the event and those who had inspired it”. See Παραχαταθήχη, No. 2 (September-October
1998), p. 8B: “Είδήσεις χαί Σχόλια” (News and Notes).

of such a circumstance, we have no other option (and never have had) than obedience to the will of God, as this is
expressed by our Father among the Saints, John of Damascus122:
“Therefore, brethren, let us stand aright on the rock of the Faith and the Tradition of the Church, not moving the
boundaries which our Holy Fathers have fixed; not giving place to those who want to innovate and destroy the edifice
of the Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church of God; for if license is granted to any who so wishes, little by little the
entire Body of the Church will be destroyed”123
.
It is well-known that the ecumenical movement, “the historical roots and starting-points” of which “are without
doubt to be found in the last century”124, rejected the concept of heresy by reason of its “ecumenical theology” and
the “ecumenization of theology”125
, and also “for the sake of ecumenist politesse and on account of the prevailing
ecumenical spirit”126
. This was to be expected, since the key issue was (and continues to be) the institutional
expression of Christian Unity, imposed from above (by the technocrats and diplomats of Geneva), through the
revision or artful sidestepping of existing theological differences, and not the charismatic “Unity of the Faith”
through the healing of heretical thinking by repentance and by the return of the heterodox. This movement
“notwithstanding its claims to the contrary, has always been and still is a purely Western phenomenon, based on
Western presuppositions and determined by a specifically Western agenda”127
128
.
This rejection of the concept of heresy is contrary to Saint Maximos the Confessor’s words who says that “We offend
God” when we give heretics “license in any manner whatsoever...to parade their falsehood within our circles and to
agitate against the true Faith... For I reckon it misanthropy and a departure from Divine love to lend support to error,
that those previously captivated by it should undergo still greater corruption”129
.
As long as the heterodox continue to remain in their errors, we avoid communion with them, especially in common
prayer. All those Holy Canons which address the matter of common prayer are unanimous in prohibiting not only
common officiating and common prayer in the temple of God, but even ordinary prayers in private quarters. The
Church's strict stance toward the heterodox springs from true love and sincere concern for their salvation, and out
of Her pastoral care that the faithful be not carried away by heresy. Whosoever loves, reveals the truth and does not
leave the other in falsehood; otherwise, any love and agreement with him would only be counterfeit and false. There
is such a thing as a good war and a bad peace: “...for a praiseworthy war is superior to a peace that separates one
from God” says Saint Gregory the Theologian130. And Saint John the Chrysostom recommends: “If you should see
devoutness infringed upon, do not prefer a oneness of mind to the truth, but stand fast until death... in no way
betraying the truth”. And elsewhere, he recommends with emphasis: “Do not accept any false dogma on the pretext
of love”131

The great champion of Orthodoxy, St. Athanasios of Alexandria, who was exiled six times for his exactitude in matters
of Faith, writes the following characteristic remarks, which are not subject to any misinterpretation:
“Shun those who openly hold the impiety [of Arios], because we are especially bound to avoid communion with men
whose beliefs we abhor; but guard yourselves from those who, while they pretend not to hold with Arios, yet
commune with the impious; if any pretend that he confesses the right faith, but appears to commune with them [the
impious Arians], exhort him to abstain from such communion; however, if he persists in a contentious spirit, repudiate
him. For, if you continue in this way, you will keep your faith pure”132
.
St. Maximos the Confessor, who was also exiled for his exactitude in matters of Faith, was under pressure to
commune with the heretical Monothelites; the Saint absolutely refused to do this, even by οίχονομία; and he
conclusively states that one who accepts heretics and communes with them, in essence accepts the Devil and turns
against God. Let us follow St. Maximos’ train of thought:
“God chose and raised up Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers for the perfecting of the Faithful; but the Devil chose
and raised up pseudo-apostles, pseudo-prophets, and pseudo-teachers against the true Faith. By pseudo-apostles,
pseudo-prophets, and pseudo-teachers I mean nothing other than heretics, whose words and thoughts are perverse.
Just as he who accepts true Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers, accepts God, so also, he who accepts pseudo-apostles,
pseudo-prophets, and pseudo-teachers accepts the Devil”133
.
St. Theodore the Studite, that clear-voiced herald of “Orthodox and God-pleasing resistance”134, exhorts the
Orthodox to avoid communion with heretics “as they would the venom of a serpent, which blackens not the body,
as the Theologian says somewhere, but the depths of the Soul”135. In another instance, St. Theodore states
categorically, along with other Confessor-Abbots, that even if an Angel should descend from Heaven “teaching and
preaching” contrary to the “Evangelical Faith”, contrary to “the Apostolic confession” and the “religion handed down
by the Fathers”, “we would not accept him into communion, since he would not confirm to the sound teaching of the
Faith”136
. In another place, the Saint also declares: “The Divine Chrysostom has declared loudly and clearly that not
only heretics, but also those who commune with such people, are enemies of God”; “some have suffered total
shipwreck as regards the Faith; others, even though they have not been submerged through their thinking,
nonetheless perish along with the former through their communion with heresy”137
.
St. Basil the Great enunciates precisely this view: “As for those who pretend to confess the correct Faith, but
commune with the heterodox, if they do not recant after being corrected, you should not only consider them
excommunicated, but should not even call them brethren”138
.
The following is a very lucid and extremely important statement by St. Gennadios Scholarios, the first Patriarch and
Ethnarch after the fall of Constantinople; the verdict of this holy man epitomizes the pious mentality of our age-old
Orthodox Tradition: “The spiritual communion of those who have the same beliefs, and their complete submission to

genuine Pastors, are expressed by those whom they commemorate. The Synods and the rest of the Fathers enjoin us
to avoid communion with those whose beliefs we abhor”139
.
For the Good Estate of the Holy Churches of God and for the Union of All
We have seen so far what was and is being done by Orthodox ecumenists and the position of our Holy Fathers. One
would add an ostensibly legitimate question: “Why are you uneasy about unionist endeavors, when our Orthodox
Church prays night and day ‘for the good estate of the Holy Churches of God and for the union of all’, and the union
of Christians is the will of the Lord, for which reason, before His Passion, He prayed to His Heavenly Father, ‘That
they all may be one’?”140
.
We must, therefore, respond to this question, it is indeed one of the favorite arguments of ecumenists, who use it
as an easy solution and copout when they confront the documented critique of the pious anti-ecumenist.
Now, when the Faithful are urged by the Deacon to pray “for the good estate of the Holy Churches of God”, are they
being urged, in fact, to pray for the Orthodox Church and the different heretical communities, understood together
as Holy Churches of God? Certainly not! Such an interpretation would constitute the most abject impiety. “Holy
Churches” are considered and called by Sacred Tradition the Most Holy local Orthodox Churches everywhere in the
world, which, being in a communion of Faith and perfect love, jointly comprise the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic
Church141
.
St. Cyril of Jerusalem, referring to the geographical meaning of the term, says that the Church “is called Catholic
because She extends over all the world, from one end of the earth to the other”142. Metrophanes Kritopoulos, the
Patriarch of Alexandria, writes that the Fathers called the Church “Catholic” ... on account of the unity of the
individual and local Churches scattered everywhere, which all, by the bond of the All-Holy Spirit, constitute the One
Catholic Church143. But the local Orthodox Churches are subject to the danger of being shaken by heresies and
schisms, and of losing “sound doctrine”144 and their immovable stability on the foundations of correct Faith, so that
the unity between them in faith and love is torn asunder and they fall away from Catholic unity.
Intense and fervent petitions (such as For the Good Estate of the Holy Churches of God and for the Union of All said
by the Priest or Deacon), therefore, should be offered by the pious pleroma of the Faithful for the preservation of
unity among the Most Holy local Orthodox Churches – in correct teaching, to be sure, of the word of Truth and of
139 St. Gennadios Scholarios, “Letter to the Dignitaries of the Church”, cited in Ό ’Όσιος Γρηγόριος [Holy Mountain],
No. 21 (1996), p. 23. This letter was written on November 15, 1452, and “is addressed to ecclesiastical dignitaries.
It represents the final attempt to avert the submission to Papal demands, with a view, supposedly, to saving
Constantinople”; “One month later, on December 12, the Orthodox concelebrated with the Latins in Hagia Sophia”
(ibid., p. 22). The final clause of this quotation is clearly an allusion to the words of St. Athanasios the Great: “We
are bound to avoid communion with men who beliefs we abhor”.

141 “Jointly comprise” should not be understood collectively; every Local Church is a complete Church, identical
with the entire Body of Christ, and is called “Catholic, to the extent, assuredly, that She maintains the Faith without

Bishop is in the Church and the Church in the Bishop”, St. Cyprian of Carthage characteristically says (Epistle 66,

the Apostolic Faith, but also “in the bond of peace”145 and of love, “which is the bond of perfectness”146
. In this
regard, it has been very correctly observed147 that this petition recapitulates, in the form of a prayer, the injunction
of the Apostle Paul to the Thessalonians: “Stand fast [in the right Faith], and hold the traditions which ye have been
taught, whether by word, or our epistle [viz., of the Apostles]”148
.
Moreover, that the truly compunctionate petition by the Deacon “for the good estate of the Holy Churches of God
and for the union of all” cannot include the assemblies of the various heretics and schismatics, which – according to
the Holy Fathers – are pseudo-churches and are, strictly speaking, called “churches of evildoers” and “abominable
gatherings”149, is proved very plainly, also, from the petitions used in the most ancient liturgical practice, as it is
preserved for us in the Apostolic Constitutions. Here are two typical diaconal exhortations:
1- 2- Let us pray for the Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, which is spread from one end of the earth to the
other; that the Lord will preserve and keep Her unshaken and free from the waves of this life, until the end
of the world, as founded upon a rock...
Let us pray for every Episcopacy under Heaven, of those that teach aright the word of Thy truth150
151
.
What Churches and what sort of union is spoken of in this petition? The word “church” (εκκλησια) usually is not used
in Patristic writing in relation to heretical communities, with only a few exceptions152. St. Hippolytos of Rome, for
example, does not call the community of Bishop Kallistos a church, but rather, a school, as the heretical communities
were called153
. This is in spite of the fact that the differences between St. Hippolytus and Bishop Kasslistos were not
dogmatic, but were of a disciplinary character, i.e., a schism. Furthermore, only Orthodox Churches could be called
“Holy Churches of God”. Therefore the pretense of the ecumenists to interpret the word “churches”, as used in the
petition, to mean heterodox churches, has no foundation.
“The Holy Churches of God” are local Orthodox Churches. Since apostolic times it has been the custom to call the
Christian community of each city a church. Thus St. Paul writes his epistles to the Church of God which is at Corinth
(1 Cor, 1:2), and unto the Churches of Galatia (Gal. 1:2), and St. John the Theologian writes to the Churches in
Ephesus, Smyrna, etc. (Rev. 2:1,8). In our time the Church of an entire nation is usually called a church: the Russian
Church, the Georgian Church, etc. All these local Churches, remaining in oneness of mind and prayerful communion
with one another, comprise the One, Catholic (Universal), Church.154
The word union (ενωτιζ) here has the meaning, unity, remaining in unity. That the word ενωτιζ can have the indicated
meaning is evident from the fact that it is used in relation to the Persons of the Holy Trinity, One in essence155
. Thus,
the Holy Church, in the petition “for the union of all the holy Churches of God”, prays not for something which does

not exist and is necessary to attain, but for that unity of the Church which already exists, that it might always exist
and not be destroyed by some heresy or schism156
.
However – so as to complete the picture –, the second part of this petition, “for the union of all”, is best interpreted
by means of the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great.
The union of all is always understood in the context and on the presuppositions of Orthodox ecclesiology; for this
reason, this Holy Father beseeches in the marvellous Prayer of the Anaphora, after the sanctification of the Precious
Gifts: “...bring back those who have gone astray, and unite them to Thy Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church”; “make
the schisms of the Churches to cease”; “speedily destroy the uprisings of heresies by the power of Thy Holy Spirit”157
.
That is, only through the cessation of schisms, the destruction of heresies, and the return and re-union of the erring
to Orthodoxy is the union of all achieved, by the Grace of God158
. By the word “schism” (in Greek, σχισμα literally
means: a split, tear; from the word σχιζω: I tear, I rend) the Church is represented as a piece of clothing torn in
pieces. This brings to mind the vision of Hieromartyr Peter, Archbishop of Alexandria (martyred in the year 311). The
Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him in the form of a twelve-year-old child in torn clothing. In answer to St. Peter’s
questions, “O Creator, who has torn Your clothing?” the Lord answered, “The mindless Arius; he has separated from
Me people whom I had obtained with My blood”159
. Here, one must understand the raiment of Christ to be the
Church – the tunic of Christ which the pagan soldiers once decided not to tear is now being rent by heretics. For the
Holy Fathers the tunic of Christ, without seams but woven from top to bottom, symbolizes the unity of the Church.
According to St. Cyprian of Carthage, “The tunic of Christ, completely woven together, indicates the indivisible
harmony of all of us who have been clothed in Christ. With the mystical sign of His clothing, the Lord prefigured the
unity of the Church”160
.
Blessed Theophyclat the Bulgarian explains the passage of Ephesians 4:13 as follows: “We all attain to the unity of
the faith, i.e., we appear all having one faith, not differing from one another in matters of dogma, and not having
amongst ourselves differences in manner of life. For then there will be true unity of faith, when we will have the
correct opinion in matters of teaching and will preserve the union of love” (Commentary on The New Testament by
Blessed Theophylact)161
.
According to St. Simeon of Thessalonica, in praying for the “union of all”, we are praying for the spiritual and mystical
unity of all members of the Church with each other, “for unity in correct faith, love, and a God-pleasing life”162
. The
unity of the Church not only has unity of the Son with the Father as its model but is a result of Her unity with the
Holy Spirit. The nature of Her unity is Triadocentric: The Church is united with the Father through the Holy Spirit in
Christ the Savior. Our Lord preserves and safeguards His Body in unity with the Father; there is, however, the danger
that someone may fall away from this unity, as Judas did. Jesus Christ, therefore, through His prayer does not enjoin
that the faithful members of His Body be one with those who have fallen away from Her, nor does He regard the
Faithful and those who have fallen away as one. But he beseeches the Father to preserve His Church in the God-
given unity which She already experiences in His truth, love, and glory. In such a way, the world, seeing this wonderful
unity of the Church, will come to know and believe in the Divine and redemptive mission of Jesus Christ163

When praying for an end to the schism and the union of the Orthodox Churches, however, we must remember that
the foundation, the cornerstone of such a union can only be the truth. The statement of St. Irenaeus is clear: all who
“are outside the Truth are outside the Church”164
.
Conclusion
Ecumenism is the heresy of heresies, because until now every separate heresy in the history of the Church has striven
itself to stand in the place of the true Church, while the ecumenical movement, having united all heresies, invites
them all together to honor themselves as the one true Church. Here ancient Arianism, Monophysitism,
Monothelitism, Iconoclasm, Pelagianism [, Papism], and simply every possible superstition of the contemporary sects
under completely different names, have united and charge to assault the Church. This phenomenon is undoubtedly
of an apocalyptic character. The devil has fought in turn, almost in sequence, with Christ’s Truth set forth in the
Nicaean Symbol of Faith, and has come now to the final and most vitally important paragraph of the Creed: “I believe
in One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church”. We say the most important, because all the truths set forth in the
Creed are brought into life in the final paragraph, are realized in the Church of Christ, Which gives us not only the
true Orthodox Teaching, but also grace-bestowing power to realize these truths, to live by them, only in the Church
and through the Church. The Church, as Archbishop Hilarion says in his work, There Is No Christianity without the
Church, is not a dream of the Church, but life in Christ165
.
We must unequivocally point out that the ecumenical movement cannot be called a Church movement. Church unity
and communion in prayer can be built only on the foundation of One Truth in Christ, i.e., in the One Apostolic Church.
Imaginary unity with the representatives of different religions, founded on political principles, must always remain
a human affair. The purpose of the Orthodox Church consists in the establishment of a God-man union, in the
Churchifying of the world and bringing man to Christ. All other attempts at the establishment of peace and union
among people are foreign to the Church. Therefore, we appeal to all the faithful children of the Holy Orthodox
Church that they not waste their time and energy in useless attempts at establishing some kind of imaginary peace,
but to enter completely into the living stream of our Church life, into the Churchifying of all our society and all our
life, in the center of which, like an unwavering cornerstone, stands our Lord Jesus Christ and the One, Catholic, and
Apostolic Church founded by Him166
.
Orthodoxy, with its Hesychastic and Eucharistic experience, has answers that solve all of the world's problems, such
that there is no need for it to cooperate or identify with the miscellaneous falsehoods of heretics, in order to save
the world. It is genuine Truth, not adulterated Truth, that frees and saves the world. An adulterated Christianity
ultimately degenerates into the salt which has lost its savor167 and which when it is not trampled on with disdain, is
placed on a par – as socially useful – with the other religions of the world. For this reason, we direct an appeal to our
brothers, the ecumenists, to reverse their course168
.
With the help of God and the intercessions of our Lady Theotokos, we shall confront all the dangers victoriously169
