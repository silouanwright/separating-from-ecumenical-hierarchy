# Orthodox Liturgical Commemoration Practices: A Comprehensive Analysis

## 1. What Exactly Happens During the Commemoration of Bishops/Patriarchs in the Divine Liturgy

### Specific Points of Commemoration

Orthodox hierarchs are commemorated at several crucial moments during the Divine Liturgy:

**During the Prothesis (Preparation Service):**
- Before the liturgy begins, the priest removes particles from the prosphora (liturgical bread) while praying for hierarchs by name
- These particles represent the hierarchs who will be mystically present in the Eucharistic sacrifice

**At the Great Entrance:**
- As the priest carries the Holy Gifts from the Prothesis to the altar, he prays: "May the Lord God remember in His Kingdom our Archbishop (Name), our Bishop (Name)..."

**During the Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer):**
- After the consecration, the most solemn commemoration occurs with these exact words:
- **"Among the first remember, Lord, our Archbishop (Name); grant him to Your holy churches in peace, safety, honor, and health, unto length of days, rightly teaching the word of Your truth."**
- **"Again we beseech You, Lord, remember all Orthodox bishops who rightly teach the word of Your truth, the presbyterate, the diaconate in Christ, and every priestly and monastic order."**

### Exact Prayers Used

The liturgical texts specify that the priest prays for the bishop "in whose name he is celebrating the Liturgy" and asks that the bishop be kept "in the Orthodox Faith." The prayers emphasize the bishop's role in:
- Preserving Orthodox teaching
- Maintaining church unity  
- Shepherding the faithful in peace and safety
- "Rightly dividing the word of truth"

### Theological Significance of Each Moment

**Prothesis Commemoration:** Represents the offering of the hierarchs to God, symbolically placing them within the Eucharistic sacrifice itself.

**Great Entrance Commemoration:** Demonstrates that the liturgy is offered not just by the local priest, but in the name and authority of the bishop, emphasizing apostolic succession.

**Anaphoral Commemoration:** The most solemn moment, occurring after consecration when the gifts have become the Body and Blood of Christ, emphasizing that hierarchs are remembered "among the first" in God's Kingdom.

### Historical Development

The practice developed gradually:
- **3rd Century:** Cyprian of Carthage provides evidence that calling out names of living and dead was already "ancient and established"
- **4th Century:** First known use of formal diptychs (tablet lists) for liturgical commemoration
- **5th Century:** Correspondence between Cyril of Alexandria and Patriarch Atticus shows established practice in major sees
- **9th Century:** Canon 15 of the First-Second Council (861 AD) formalized the hierarchical pattern: priests commemorate bishops, bishops commemorate metropolitans, metropolitans commemorate patriarchs

## 2. Orthodox Theological Sources on Why Commemoration Creates Spiritual Unity

### Patristic Sources

The Orthodox Church views commemoration through the lens of the **Mystical Body of Christ**. Key theological principles include:

**From the Church Fathers:**
- The practice reflects the organic unity of Scripture, Tradition, liturgical practice, and spiritual life
- Church Fathers serve as authoritative interpreters who experienced and transmitted the faith through their own spiritual lives
- The commemoration expresses the **communion of saints** - the unity between the Church Militant (living) and Church Triumphant (departed)

**Canon Law Perspective:**
- Orthodox canon law is based on "both intellectual and mystical approaches to God"
- Canons aim to promote "spiritual perfection" and serve the Church's mystical nature as the Body of Christ
- The overriding consideration is "the spiritual well-being of the members of Christ's Mystical Body"

### Modern Orthodox Theologians

**Metropolitan John Zizioulas:**
- Views the Eucharist as offering "an eschatological vision and foretaste of the Kingdom of God"
- Emphasizes that commemorative remembrance involves "remembering the future King"
- The Eucharist creates authentic personhood and realizes "the ecclesial mode of being"
- In early Christianity, "the eucharistic assembly and the church were essentially identical concepts"

**Alexander Schmemann:**
- Sees the Eucharist as fundamentally connected to human transformation and authentic existence
- Views priestly offering as primarily praise that enables humans to become their true selves
- Emphasizes the cosmic and transformative dimension of Eucharistic worship

### The Mystical Reality of Eucharistic Communion

Orthodox theology teaches that the Eucharist:
- **Transcends time and space:** "All believers are seen as united in worship in the Kingdom of God along with the departed saints and the angels of heaven"
- **Creates mystical communion:** "It is the mystical communion of men with God, with each other, and with all men and all things in him through Christ and the Spirit"
- **Makes present unseen reality:** "Everything in the liturgy is seen as symbolic, but not merely so, for it makes present the unseen reality"

## 3. The Diptychs and Their Significance

### Definition and Historical Use

**Diptychs** were originally hinged writing tablets that Christians adapted for liturgical use, inscribing names of martyrs, bishops, and faithful to be remembered during the liturgy. The term now refers to official lists of living and departed commemorated by local churches.

### Historical Development

- **3rd Century:** Evidence from Cyprian shows established practice of naming living and dead
- **Late 4th Century:** First formal diptych tablets used
- **Early 5th Century:** Separate tablets for living and dead established
- **12th Century (West)/14th Century (East):** Physical tablets discontinued, but term and practice continued

### Liturgical Practice

- Names were read aloud by deacon during Divine Liturgy and by priest during Liturgy of Preparation
- **Traditional pattern:** Clergy commemorated their bishop, bishops their metropolitan, metropolitans their patriarch, patriarchs commemorated other patriarchs and heads of autocephalous churches

### Theological Meaning

**Communion and Unity:**
- Inscription of a bishop's name means the local church considers itself in communion with him
- Removal indicates breaking communion
- Demonstrates "religious community and union between the Churches"

**Test of Orthodoxy:**
- Became "touchstones of orthodoxy" - only those of "blameless orthodoxy" were included
- Removal implied accusation of heresy
- Served as "a particular weapon in controversies between Rome and the Eastern Churches"

**Expression of Autocephaly:**
- Originally prayer for Church head, became "proclamation of that hierarch's jurisdiction and autocephaly"
- Performed "in a particularly theatrical and solemn way" as a "status symbol"

**Communion of Saints:**
- Expresses "hope of resurrection, unity of the Church, and power of love"
- Demonstrates that "we all belong to the One Body of the Risen Lord"

## 4. Historical Examples of Ceasing Commemoration to Break Communion

### Recent Examples

**Bishop Longin of Bancheny (2016):**
- Ceased commemorating Patriarch Kirill after the Havana Declaration with Pope Francis
- Called the declaration "a betrayal of Orthodoxy, a legalization of the teachings of Antichrist"
- Objected to recognizing the Roman Pope as a canonical bishop
- Stated that "the pope became a brother to His Holiness, and we, Orthodox, have become his enemies"

**Moldovan Clergy (2016):**
- Ceased commemorating Metropolitan Vladimir and Patriarch Kirill
- Cited "public and open preaching of heresy" regarding documents containing "ecclesiological heresies"
- Specifically objected to claims about "restoration of unity of Christians" and "lost unity of Christians"

**Crete Priests (2017):**
- At least four priests ceased commemorating their bishops
- Believed bishops had fallen into "heresy of ecumenism" by accepting 2016 council documents

### Canonical Basis

**Canon 15 of the First-Second Council (861 AD):**
- If a bishop "openly declares a heresy previously condemned," priests may cease commemoration without ecclesiastical sanction
- Such persons "not only are not subject to canonical penalty for walling themselves off from communion with the so-called bishop before synodical clarification, but they shall be deemed worthy of due honor among the Orthodox"

### Historical Precedent

- **Saint Maximus the Confessor** broke communion with the Patriarch of Constantinople
- The practice has "deep historical roots in Orthodox tradition" and continues in contemporary theological disputes

### Theological Reasoning

Clergy cease commemoration when they believe hierarchs have:
- Publicly preached heresy
- Compromised Orthodox ecclesiology through ecumenism
- Violated canonical Orthodox teaching about church unity
- Entered into inappropriate relationships with non-Orthodox churches

## Conclusion for Laypeople

For Orthodox laypeople, understanding liturgical commemoration is crucial because:

1. **Every liturgy you attend includes these commemorations** - your priest mentions bishops by name multiple times during each service
2. **These aren't just polite mentions** - they're profound theological statements about church unity, apostolic succession, and communion
3. **The commemorations connect your local parish to the universal Orthodox Church** - through your bishop to metropolitan to patriarch to the entire Orthodox communion
4. **When commemorations cease, it signals serious theological crisis** - it means the basic unity of the Church is threatened
5. **The Eucharist itself is the source and summit of church unity** - the commemorations make visible the invisible bonds that unite all Orthodox Christians across time and space

This practice reflects the Orthodox understanding that the Church is not merely a human organization, but the mystical Body of Christ, where every member - living and departed, clergy and laity - participates in the eternal liturgy of heaven through the Eucharistic sacrifice.
