Elder Paisios
On Ecumenism
2The Holy Mountain,
23 January 1969
Reverend Father Haralambos,
As I have seen a great deal of uproar at what is happening in
our Church, that is in the various movements of groups in favour of
unification (with Heterodoxy), as well as in the relations of the
Oecumenical Patriarch with the Pope, as a child of the Church I was
pained. Therefore I considered it a good thing to send together with
my prayers a small thread (which I have as a poor monk), that it too
may be used as a means of stitching together the many-layered
raiment of our Mother. I know that you will show love and share it
only with your religious friends. Thank you.
First of all, I would like to ask forgiveness from everyone for
making so bold as to write something, when I am neither holy nor
a theologian. I trust everyone will understand me, that my writing
is nothing more than an expression of my deep pain at the
unfortunate stance and worldly love of our father Patriarch
Athenagoras (+July 7, 1972).
It appears he has loved another modern woman - who is
called the Papist Church - because our Orthodox Mother has not
made an impression on him at all, for She is so modest. This love,
which was heard coming from Constantinople, caused a sensational
impression of sorts among many Orthodox, who nowadays live in
an environment of such meaningless love, in cities all over the
world. Moreover, this love is of the spirit of our age: the family will
lose its divine meaning from just such kinds of love, which have as
their aim break-up and not union.
With just such a worldly love, the Patriarch takes us to Rome.
While he should have shown love first of all to us his children and to
our Mother Church, unfortunately he sent his love very far away.
The result, it is true, has delighted secular children who love the
3
world as those who have this worldly love - but it has completely
scandalized us, the children of Orthodoxy, young and old, who have
the fear of God...
With sadness I must write that among all the 'unionists' I
have met, I have never seen one who had even a drop or shred of
spirituality. Nevertheless, they know how to speak about love and
union, while they themselves are not united with God, for they have
not loved Him.
Tenderly I wish to beseech all our unionist brothers: Since
the issue of the union of the Church is a spiritual matter, and we
need spiritual love, let us leave it to those who love God greatly and
are (genuine) theologians, like the Fathers of the Church, and not to
the legalists. Let us leave it to those who have offered and continue
to offer themselves up in service to the Church (instead of just
buying big candles) and who were and are lit by the fire of love for
God, rather than by the lighter of the church sacristanâ€|
We should recognize that there exist not only natural but
also spiritual laws. Therefore, the future wrath of God will not be
averted by a meeting of sinners (for then we shall receive double the
wrath), but by repentance and adherence to the commandments of
the Lord.
Also, we should be clearly aware that our Orthodox Church
does not have even one shortcoming. The only apparent
insufficiency is the shortage of sober hierarchs and pastors with a
Patristic foundation. 'Few are chosen'. This should not, however,
upset us. The Church is Christ's and He governs Her. It is not a
Temple built by the pious from rocks, sand and cement, which is
then destroyed by the fire of barbarians; the Church is Christ
Himself. 'And whosoever shall fall on this Stone shall be broken: but
on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder' (Matt. 21,
44-45).
When He needs to, the Lord will bring forth the Mark of
Ephesuses and the Gregory Palamases, in order to bring together
4all our scandalized brethren, to confess the Orthodox Faith,
strengthen the Tradition and give great joy to our Mother, the
Church.
In times past we have seen that many faithful children of our
Church, monastics and laypeople, have unfortunately broken away
from Her on account of the unionists. In my opinion, separation
from the Church whenever the Patriarch makes a mistake is not
good at all. From within, close to the Mother Church, it is the duty
and obligation of each member to struggle in their own way. To
cease commemoration of the Patriarch; to break away and create
their own Church and continue to speak insultingly to the Patriarch,
that I think, is senseless.
If, on account of this or that occasional deviation of the
Patriarchs, we separate ourselves and make our own Churches -
may God protect us! â€“ we shall surpass even the Protestants. It is
easy to separate but difficult to return. Unfortunately we have many
'churches' in our times, created either by big groups or even just one
person. Because there happened to be a church in their kalyve (I am
speaking about things happening on the Holy Mountain), they
considered that they could create their own independent Church.
If the unionists gave the Church the first wound, the
aforementioned give the second. Let us pray that God will illumine
all of us, including our Patriarch Athenagoras, that union of these
'churches' will come about first; that peace will be made within the
scandalized Orthodox fold; so that peace and love will exist among
the Orthodox Churches. Then let us think about union with other
'confessions' - and only if they sincerely desire to embrace Orthodox
Teaching.
I would further like to say that there does exist another, third
group, within our Church. They are the brethren who remain as Her
faithful children, but who do not have spiritual concord among
themselves. They spend their time criticizing one another, and not
in the general good of the struggle. The one monitors the other
5
(more than himself) to see what he will say or write so as to
ruthlessly nail him. However, if this person had said or written the
same thing, he would certainly have supported it with numerous
passages from the Holy Scriptures and the Fathers.
Great harm comes of this - for while the one injures his
neighbour, the other strikes him back before the eyes of all the
faithful. Often, disbelief is sown in the souls of the weak, because
they are scandalized by such people. Unfortunately, some of us
make senseless claims against the others. We want them to
conform to our own spiritual character. In other words, when
someone else is not in harmony with our own character, or is only
mildly tolerant - or even a little sharp - with us, immediately we
jump to the conclusion that he is not a spiritual person.
We are all needed in the Church. All the Fathers, both the
mild and the austere, offered their services to Her. Just as sweet,
sour, bitter and even pungent herbs are necessary for a man's body
(each has its own flavour and vitamins), the same is true of the Body
of the Church. All are necessary. The one fills up the spiritual
character of the other, and all of us are duty bound to endure not
only the particular spiritual character, but even the human
weaknesses we each have.
Again, I come sincerely asking pardon from all for being so
bold as to write. I am only a simple monk, and my work is to strive,
as far as I am able, to cast off the old man and to help others and the
Church, through God, by prayer. But because heartbreaking news
regarding our Holy Orthodoxy has reached even my hermitage, I
was greatly pained, and thus considered it good to write that which
I felt. Let us all pray that God may grant His Grace, and may each of
us in our own way help achieve the glory of our Church.
With much respect to all,
Monk Paisios
