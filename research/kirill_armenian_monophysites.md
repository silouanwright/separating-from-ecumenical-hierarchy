### Patriarch Kirill and His Public Dealings with the Armenian Apostolic Church (from the Eastern Orthodox Canonical Perspective)

#### Eastern Orthodox Context

The **Eastern Orthodox Church** does not recognize the Armenian Apostolic Church as part of canonical Orthodoxy, given the latter’s rejection of the Council of Chalcedon and its distinct Christological position historically labeled as “Monophysite.” From the traditional Orthodox stance, these communities are *not* in communion.

#### Evidence of Patriarch Kirill’s Actions with the Armenian Church

Below is a rundown—supported by direct evidence—of **Patriarch Kirill’s engagement with Armenian Church leaders and communities**, specifically highlighting joint activities, participation in services, gestures of fraternity, and recognition that, under canonical Orthodox norms, would be considered ecumenical or problematic.

#### 1. Attendance at Liturgical Celebrations

- **Patriarch Kirill has publicly attended and participated in major Armenian Apostolic church events.**
  On September 17, 2013, he took part in the consecration of the large Armenian Cathedral complex in Moscow, presided over by Catholicos Karekin II. Kirill gave an address inside the church, expressing gratitude and calling for spiritual growth of both churches. At the end, Kirill, Karekin II, and Armenia’s President jointly unveiled a monument symbolizing "fraternal relationships" between the churches[1][2].

#### 2. Participation in Joint Prayers and Services

- **Kirill has led joint prayer services with Armenian hierarchs in their cathedrals.**
  For instance, Patriarch Kirill was present for a joint prayer service at the Armenian cathedral in Echmiadzin, attended by large congregations and broadcast as an ecumenical gesture[3].

#### 3. Physical Gestures and “Kiss of Peace”

- **The “kiss of peace” has been exchanged between Patriarch Kirill and Armenian primates during these encounters.**
  This is a traditional liturgical gesture, symbolizing reconciliation and brotherhood, but when performed between hierarchs who are not in communion, it is viewed by Orthodox traditionalists as a sign of practical ecumenism and raises canonical concerns[3][4].
- **Multiple instances over the years show Patriarch Kirill exchanging fraternal greetings and physical gestures with leaders of the Armenian Church in public, televised ceremonies and services**[1][5][3].

#### 4. Recognition, Awards, and Official Honors

- **Patriarch Kirill and the Russian Orthodox Church have conferred high Church awards and public honors on Armenian primates.**
  These include the Order of St. Alexis, presented to Catholicos Karekin II for his service, cementing a position of fraternal recognition despite the lack of communion[5][6].
- Reciprocal prayers, blessings, and public words of praise have been exchanged at these meetings, in language virtually identical to intra-Orthodox primatial relations—another point of tension for those upholding strict canonical boundaries[7][8].

#### 5. Repeated Visits and Ongoing Fraternal Relations

- **Kirill’s presence at multiple official Armenian church occasions, including anniversaries, ecumenical meetings, and humanitarian events, is extensively documented**[1][9][10].
- Statements frequently refer to “brotherhood” and “fraternal cooperation,” sometimes omitting clear dogmatic distinctions and thus fueling debates within traditionalist Orthodox communities[8][3].

#### Summary

From a canonical Orthodox viewpoint, **Patriarch Kirill’s repeated attendance at Armenian Apostolic services, joint prayers, liturgical exchanges, giving of the “kiss of peace,” and public gestures of fraternity all stand as clear evidence of practical ecumenism with a body not recognized as Orthodox by the Eastern Orthodox Churches**.
Such actions are consistently documented in published synodal press releases, Armenian Church announcements, and Orthodox news archives, showing a sustained pattern of high-level participation and recognition that surpasses mere diplomatic courtesy[1][5][3].
