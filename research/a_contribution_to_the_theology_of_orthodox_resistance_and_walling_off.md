A Contribution to the Theology
of Orthodox Resistance and Walling-Off
The terms “resistance” and “resisters” are Patristic. They are men-
tioned, for example, by that great struggler for Orthodoxy, St. Theo-
dore the Studite.
Everyone who “resists for the sake of the truth”1 is fighting the
good fight of “Orthodox and God-pleasing resistance.”2 For this rea-
son, he is regarded as a Confessor of the Orthodox Faith, “for every-
one who resists is a Confessor”3 against heresy and for the sake of Or-
thodoxy.
Consequently, such a person is worthy of the “honor” due to an Or-
thodox Christian, according to the Fifteenth Canon of the First-Sec-
ond Synod. In what follows we will cite the authoritative interpreta-
tion of this canon by Bishop Nikodim (Milaš).4

and prestige. Of Serbian descent, he was born in Sibenik on 16 April 1845. He
graduated from the Karlovci Theological Seminary, attended classes in philosophy
at the University of Vienna, and completed the Kiev Theological Academy, where
he was awarded the degree of Master of Theology. The degree of Doctor of Theol-

homeland in 1874, he taught at ecclesiastical schools and seminaries. In 1890, he
was Consecrated Bishop of Dalmatia and Istria, then under Austro-Hungarian oc-

Commentary
on the Fifteenth Canon
of the First-Second Synod5
by the ever-memorable Bishop Nikodim (Milaš)
This Canon, which comple-
ments the Thirteenth and Four-
teenth Canons of the present Syn-
od, prescribes that since there must
exist a relationship (a relationship,
that is, of submission and obedi-
ence) between a Presbyter and his
Bishop and between a Bishop and
his Metropolitan, how much more
must there be such a relationship
towards the Patriarch, to whom all
owe canonical obedience: the Met-
ropolitans, the Bishops, the Pres-
byters, and the other clergy of the
Patriarchate in question.
Having defined these condi-
tions concerning obedience to the
Bishop Nikodim
Patriarch, the Canon makes a gen-
eral observation regarding the three Canons (XIII-XV), in which it
says that the promulgated decrees are valid only in that case in which
schisms are introduced on account of unproven transgressions by a
Patriarch, Metropolitan, or Bishop.

If, however, a Bishop, Metropolitan, or Patriarch begins to preach
publicly in Church any heretical doctrine that is antithetical to Ortho-
doxy, then the aforementioned clergy have a right and at the same
time an obligation to separate themselves forthwith from that Bishop,
Metropolitan, or Patriarch, and for this reason not only will they not be
subject to any canonical penalty, but will, moreover, even be praised,
insofar as they have not thereby reprehended or rebelled against le-
gitimate Bishops, but against false bishops and false teachers, and
have not thereby initiated any schism in the Church, but on the con-
trary have delivered the Church, as far as possible, from schism and
division.
Archimandrite John (a well-known Russian Canonist [later Bish-
op of Smolensk—Trans.]), having in view the historical circumstanc-
es of the Church of Russia, observes, in his interpretation of the pres-
ent Canon, completely correctly and in accordance with a rigorous
conception of Canonical science, that a Presbyter who secedes from
his own Bishop by reason of heretical teaching [on the part of the lat-
ter] will not be culpable, but praiseworthy, yet when and only when
the said Bishop begins preaching a doctrine that openly contradicts the
teaching of the Orthodox Church and has been formally condemned
by the Church,6 and if he proclaims this false doctrine openly, publicly,
and in Church, with resolute intent to subvert Orthodox teaching and
to uphold heresy; if otherwise (if, that is, a Bishop expresses some pri-
vate opinion of his on matters of faith and morals which might appear
to someone as incorrect, but is not especially important and is easi-
ly corrected, the Bishop not yet having been inculpated for deliberate
unorthodoxy, or again, if the Bishop in question expresses his errone-
ous doctrine in a narrower circle of particular persons, so that it is at-
6 “[A]nd formally condemned by the Church....”
• Note: This view, in our humble opinion, is not quite correct; for praiseworthy
walling-off is not implemented only when a heresy that has previously been formal-
ly condemned is preached, but in general when any kind of heresy, whether ancient
or newly manifest, is proclaimed.
The verb καταγιγνώσκω and the participle κατεγνωσμένος-η certainly do
mean “I condemn” (καταδικάζω) and “condemned” (καταδικασμένος-η), but in
the present case of the Fifteenth Canon of the First-Second Synod they have another
meaning, as is evident from the grammatical, syntactic, Biblical, and hermeneutical
tradition of the Sacred Canons, and also from the praxis of the Church throughout
history.

tainable that the doctrine in question be corrected within this narrow-
er circle, the peace of the Church not being breached), in such a case
no Presbyter has the right to secede high-handedly from his own Bish-
op and create a schism; otherwise, he will be subject to the injunction
prescribed regarding these matters by the Thirty-first Apostolic Canon.

Second Œcumenical Synod; Third Canon of the Third Œcumenical
Synod; Eighteenth Canon of the Fourth Œcumenical Synod; Thirty-
first and Thirty-fourth Canons of the Synod in Trullo; Sixth Canon of

The Fifteenth Canon of the First-Second Synod
The rules set forth regarding Presbyters, Bishops, and Metropol-
itans are all the more applicable to Patriarchs. Hence, if a Presbyter,
More specifically, the verb καταγιγνώσκω means also “I ascribe something to
someone as an accusation,” “I accuse someone of something” (e.g., “I accuse some-
one of cowardice”), and the participle κατεγνωσμένος-η means “to be blameworthy
or reprehensible.”
Examples:
• “For” Peter “was to be blamed” (Galatians 2:11): he was blameworthy or rep-
rehensible.
• “For if our heart condemn us,” “if our heart condemn us not” (I St. John 3:20,
21): our conscience condemns us for our behavior.
• “Many actions are performed to our peril, and even reprehensibly” (St. Basil
the Great, On Baptism, II.8, Patrologia Græca, Vol. XXXI, col. 1601A): blamewor-
thily or reprehensibly.
• “Not having found any fault with the Bishop” (Thirty-first Apostolic Canon).
• “Reprehending his own Bishop on the basis of certain charges” (Thirteenth
Canon of the First-Second Synod).
• “Note that the present Apostolic Canon decrees that clergy may without peril
secede from their Bishops if they reprehend them for wrong belief” (Theodore Bal-
samon, Patrologia Græca, Vol. CXXXVII, col. 97C [commentary on the Thirty-first
Apostolic Canon]).
• The faithful of Constantinople, both clergy and people, walled themselves
off from Patriarch Nestorios prior to any Synodal judgment, because this man was
preaching a newfangled and reprehensible heresy; that is, “they reprehended a false
bishop and false teacher.”

Bishop, or Metropolitan should dare to secede from communion with
his own Patriarch and fail to mention his name in the Divine Mysta-
gogy in accordance with the established and duly appointed practice,
but prior to a Synodal declaration and final condemnation of the Pa-
triarch should create a schism: the Holy Synod decrees that such a
cleric be completely deposed from all sacerdotal ministry, provided
he be convicted of this transgression. These rules have been both rat-
ified and ordained with regard to those who secede from their First
Hierarch on the pretext of certain charges against him, and create a
schism and rupture the unity of the Church. As for those who, on ac-
count of some heresy reprehended by Holy Synods or Fathers, sepa-
rate themselves from communion with their First Hierarch, who, that
is to say, is preaching the heresy publicly and teaching it barefacedly
in Church, such persons are not only not subject to any canonical pen-
alty for walling themselves off, prior to a Synodal verdict, from com-
munion with one who is called a Bishop, but will be deemed worthy of
the honor due to Orthodox Christians. For they have not reprehended
Bishops, but false bishops and false teachers, and have not sundered
the unity of the Church through any schism, but have been sedulous to
deliver the Church from schisms and divisions.
Interpretation by St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite
That which the foregoing Canons decreed concerning Bishops and
Metropolitans, the same is decreed by the present Canon, and all the
more so, concerning Patriarchs. This Canon says that if any Presbyter,
Bishop, or Metropolitan should withdraw from communion with his
Patriarch and fail to mention his name according to custom (the lat-
ter applies only to a Metropolitan; for a Presbyter mentions the name
of his Bishop, and a Bishop the name of his Metropolitan) before
disclosing the charges against their Patriarch to the Synod, and be-
fore the Patriarch has been condemned by the Synod: all of these, I
say, are to be completely deposed: Bishops and Metropolitans from
all Hierarchical officiation, and Presbyters from all sacerdotal offici-
ation. However, these provisions are to take effect if Presbyters se-
cede from their Bishops, Bishops from their Metropolitans, or Met-
ropolitans from their Patriarchs on account of certain criminal charg-
5
es, such as fornication, sacrilege, and other grave delinquencies.7 But
if the said First Hierarchs are heretics and preach their heresy openly,8
and those subject to them separate themselves from them for this rea-
son, even before a Synodal judgment has been pronounced concern-
ing this heresy, those who separate themselves are not only not con-
demned for their act of separation, but are actually worthy of due hon-
or, as Orthodox Christians, since they have not caused any schism in
the Church by their separation, but have, rather, delivered the Church
from the schism and heresy of their false bishops. See also the Thirty-
first Apostolic Canon.

7 However, the Thirty-first Apostolic Canon judges the one who separates incul-
pable, if he knows that his superior is unrighteous.
8 According to Balsamon, from this wording in the Canon it appears that one
should not separate himself from his Bishop if the latter entertains some heresy, but
keeps it secret and does not preach it; for it is possible that he will subsequently cor-
rect himself of his own accord (Patrologia Græca, Vol. CXXXVII, col. 1069A [com-
mentary on the Fifteenth Canon of the First-Second Synod]).
