# Orthodox Canonical Authority for Separation from Heretical Bishops

The Orthodox Church possesses a rich canonical tradition addressing when and how the faithful may—or must—separate from bishops who teach heresy or maintain communion with heretics. This tradition, spanning from apostolic times through contemporary practice, establishes clear principles while revealing nuanced differences in application between Orthodox jurisdictions.

## Canon 15 of the First-Second Council: The Cornerstone Text

Canon 15 of the First-Second Council of Constantinople (861 AD), presided over by Patriarch Photios the Great, provides the most explicit canonical authorization for separation from heretical bishops. The complete text states:

"The rules laid down with reference to Presbyters and Bishops and Metropolitans are still more applicable to Patriarchs. So that in case any Presbyter or Bishop or Metropolitan dares to secede or apostatize from the communion of his own Patriarch, and fails to mention the latter's name in accordance with custom duly fixed and ordained, in the divine Mystagogy, but, before a synodal verdict has been pronounced and has passed judgment against him, creates a schism, the holy Synod has decreed that this person shall be held an alien to every priestly function if only he be convicted of having committed this transgression of the law.

Accordingly, these rules have been sealed and ordained as respecting those persons who under the pretext of charges against their own presidents stand aloof, and create a schism, and disrupt the union of the Church. **But as for those persons, on the other hand, who, on account of some heresy condemned by holy Synods, or Fathers, withdrawing themselves from communion with their president, who, that is to say, is preaching the heresy publicly, and teaching it bareheaded in church, such persons not only are not subject to any canonical penalty on account of their having walled themselves off from any and all communion with the one called a Bishop before any synodical verdict has been rendered, but, on the contrary, they shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians. For they have defied, not Bishops, but pseudo-bishops and pseudo-teachers; and they have not sundered the union of the Church with any schism, but, on the contrary, have been sedulous to rescue the Church from schisms and divisions.**"

This canon emerged from the aftermath of the Iconoclastic controversy and establishes the critical distinction between schismatic separation (condemned) and justified separation from heretical bishops (praised). The canon explicitly protects those who "wall themselves off" (Greek: τειχίζω) from bishops publicly preaching heresies already condemned by synods or fathers, even before formal deposition.

## The Apostolic Foundation

The Apostolic Canons, confirmed as authoritative by the Quinisext Council (692 AD), establish strict requirements regarding communion with heretics:

**Apostolic Canon 45** decrees: "Let a bishop, presbyter, or deacon, who has only prayed with heretics, be excommunicated: but if he has permitted them to perform any clerical office, let him be deposed."

**Apostolic Canon 46** strengthens this: "We ordain that a bishop, or presbyter, who has admitted the baptism or sacrifice of heretics, be deposed. For what concord has Christ with Belial, or what part has a believer with an infidel?"

Additional relevant Apostolic Canons (10, 11, 31, 62, 65) establish that Orthodox Christians must shun heretics and their ceremonies, with Canon 31 specifically addressing those who "despising his own bishop, shall gather a separate congregation and erect another altar."

## Ecumenical Council Legislation

The Seven Ecumenical Councils reinforced these principles through various canons. The First Council of Constantinople (381) anathematized multiple heresies in Canon 1 and established procedures for receiving heretics back into the Church in Canon 7. The Council of Ephesus (431) mandated deposition for any bishop or clergyman who "shall dare to compose a different faith, or to introduce or offer it to persons desiring to turn to the acknowledgment of the truth."

These councils established that deviation from Nicene orthodoxy results in automatic deposition from clerical office or anathema for laymen, with detailed procedures for restoration requiring formal renunciation of heretical teachings.

## Patristic Witness on Canonical Separation

The Church Fathers provide consistent testimony supporting mandatory separation from heretical bishops. St. Ignatius of Antioch emphasized that those who separate from the bishop and refuse to participate in the common Eucharist due to heretical teaching are protecting the Church's unity. St. Irenaeus taught that one must separate from those who depart from apostolic succession and the universal Church's teaching.

St. Cyprian of Carthage articulated the principle most forcefully: "He can no longer have God for his Father, who has not the Church for his mother," declaring heretical bishops' sacraments invalid and mandating separation from them. St. Athanasius demonstrated this principle through five exiles for refusing communion with Arian bishops, showing that separation from heretical bishops was mandatory, not optional.

Later fathers reinforced these teachings. **St. Maximus the Confessor** famously declared: "Even if the whole universe begins to have communion with the patriarch, I alone will not communicate with him," establishing that one must separate from heretical bishops regardless of their official position or the number of their supporters. St. Theodore the Studite taught that communion with those who tolerate heresy makes one complicit in their error, citing Chrysostom that "not only heretics, but also those who have communion with them, are enemies of God."

## Canonical Commentary Through the Ages

The great 12th-century Byzantine canonists—Aristenos, Zonaras, and Balsamon—provided authoritative interpretations of Canon 15. Theodore Balsamon, as Patriarch of Antioch, emphasized the temporal aspect: "after a conciliar examination at an Orthodox Council, one is still more obliged to separate from the bishops of the second (non-Orthodox) council." All three distinguished between separation for heresy versus separation for personal grievances or accusations.

St. Nicodemus the Hagiorite in his Pedalion (1800) connected Canon 15 with Apostolic Canon 31, emphasizing that Orthodox Christians must "shun heretics and the ceremonies and rites of heretics." He stressed that bishops who accept heretical practices "either themselves entertain similar views or lack eagerness to free them from their misbelief."

Contemporary Orthodox canonist Metropolitan Peter L'Huillier emphasized the historical-critical approach to canonical interpretation while maintaining that canon law is corrective rather than prescriptive, responding to situations through both akriveia (strict application) and economia (pastoral discretion).

## Local Synodical Traditions

Local synods throughout Orthodox history have reinforced these principles. The Synod of Antioch (341 AD) decreed in Canon IV that "they who communicate with him [a deposed bishop] shall all be cast out of the Church." The Synod of Gangra (c. 340-360) anathematized those who held private assemblies outside the Church and despised canonical authority.

The differences between Greek and Russian Orthodox approaches emerged clearly in synodical practice. Greek Orthodox synods have shown stricter application of separation canons, more willing to invoke Canon 15 for liturgical irregularities and broader definitions of heresy, including ecumenical activities. Russian Orthodox synods emphasize pastoral flexibility and pragmatic approaches, with greater tolerance for liturgical variations and a narrower definition of heresy focused on core doctrinal issues.

## Critical Distinctions in Application

The canonical tradition establishes several crucial distinctions:

**Mandatory versus Optional Separation**: Separation becomes mandatory when bishops publicly preach heresy condemned by previous councils, demand acceptance of condemned doctrines, or mandate participation in heretical activities. Optional separation is permitted for questionable ecumenical activities, unauthorized liturgical innovations, or canonical irregularities.

**Conditions Triggering Separation**: The heresy must be publicly preached (not private opinion), previously condemned by councils or fathers, and the separation must be motivated by preserving church unity rather than personal grievance.

**Procedural Requirements**: Before separation, attempts at correction should be made when possible. After separation, Orthodox Christians must maintain Orthodox liturgy and sacraments, avoid creating unnecessary parallel hierarchies, and work toward eventual reconciliation when possible.

**Canonical Status**: Canon 15 explicitly protects those who legitimately separate from canonical penalties, their sacraments remain valid if properly ordained, and they are "deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians."

## Modern Applications and Controversies

Contemporary applications have proven complex. The Esphigmenou Monastery dispute represents the longest-running modern invocation of Canon 15, with monks ceasing commemoration of the Ecumenical Patriarch over ecumenical activities since the 1970s. The 2018 Moscow-Constantinople schism over Ukrainian autocephaly demonstrates how geopolitical factors complicate canonical disputes.

The Old Calendarist schisms beginning in 1924 reveal different thresholds between Greek and Russian traditions—Greek churches experienced formal schisms over the calendar change, while the Russian Church maintained the Julian calendar without breaking communion with new calendar churches.

## Synthesis of Canonical Principles

The Orthodox canonical tradition consistently maintains that separation from bishops who teach heresy or maintain communion with heretics can be not merely permissible but obligatory. This tradition rests on apostolic canons, ecumenical legislation, patristic witness, and centuries of canonical commentary. However, such separation must meet specific criteria: the heresy must be publicly taught and previously condemned, the motivation must be preserving orthodox faith rather than personal grievance, and proper procedures should be followed when possible.

The differences between Greek and Russian Orthodox applications reflect varying emphases on theological rigor versus pastoral flexibility, but both traditions accept the fundamental principle that the Church's unity must be based on orthodox faith rather than mere organizational cohesion. As contemporary Orthodox Christians face new challenges—from ecumenical dialogues to geopolitical pressures—these canonical principles provide both clear guidance and the flexibility needed for prudent application in changing circumstances.
