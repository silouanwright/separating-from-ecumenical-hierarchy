Dear Sister in Christ, Nina,

Greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ, and on the approaching feast of the Nativity of the Theotokos. Rejoice!

We don’t know Maria [Kraft] well, and don’t know what you’ve been going through with her. But: unless you are very strong and know very well what you are doing, you’d better not get involved any more. I talked with her several times when she was here, enough to see that her problems are deeper than mere “crazy convertism.” Her salvation is through suffering, if she can take it. If she is relieved of the “problem” of her children and allowed to think about “spiritual life,” her perdition is almost guaranteed. Words and good intentions aren’t going to help her. WATCH OUT: If you’ve already been so upset by her, better humble yourself and not think you can help at all, which you probably can’t.

You’ve been having Boston temptations? Does that come from telephone conversations with Boston? Are you trying to be in two places at once? Better choose your place and then stick to it and stop tickling the devil. Otherwise, not only will you have no peace, but disaster may be ahead. If you’re “through with Boston,” then be through with it!

Is the transcription of Maria finished? Can we have it? Are you using it as a spiritual “lightning rod”?

Pray for us.

With love in Christ,
Seraphim, monk
