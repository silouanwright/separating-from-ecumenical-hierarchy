Christ is Risen!

Dear Gleb,
Here is your telegram, which arrived during vigil Sat. night. Also the check for Vl. Seraphim. Two people came by Sunday to congratulate you:

1. Vera Utehina, who also gives her greetings to Ija.

2. Mrs. Goch (Ira Nikitina), who knew you in Latvia, I gathered. Her address now is: 3587 Notre Dame Dr., Santa Clara Telephone: 241-9521

According to Deacon Nikolay, Archimandrite Amvrossy is attached permanently to our Cathedral. There is also apparently something to the rumor that he went over (for a short while) to the Metropolia, but I haven’t heard the full story.

The rest of the brochure is finally set up and will be printed tomorrow. I’m printing 4000 copies, which takes a long time.

The neighborhood stray cat who chose us for the honor had her 4 kittens this morning in our back room. Whether that is supposed to have any significance I don’t know.

I will start setting up St. Nectarios before this weekend and have everything ready for efficient work. What’s your verdict on the color picture?

Pray for me.

In Christ your brother,
Eugene
