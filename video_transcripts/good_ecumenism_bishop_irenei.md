Bishop Irenei of London & Western Europe (ROCOR)

In this powerful reflection, Bishop Irenei responds to a question from a faithful Orthodox Christian in Mexico, explaining the true meaning of ecumenism, the difference between Orthodox unity and modern ecumenical efforts, and why Orthodox Christians cannot accept a diluted vision of the Church. This video dives deep into the teachings of the Ecumenical Councils, the meaning of “One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,” and how Orthodox theology views dialogue, truth, and ecclesial identity.

in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
*00:00-00:02*

Can there be such a thing as a good ecumenism?
*00:03-00:07*

I'd like to reflect today for just a short time on this question,
*00:07-00:12*

which might sound a slightly strange question,
*00:12-00:15*

depending on one's background, culturally, socially,
*00:16-00:19*

for in our modern generation,
*00:20-00:22*

certainly ecumenism as the project of dialogue and cooperation between Christians
*00:23-00:28*

is generally taken to be a positive thing.
*00:28-00:31*

However, as always, we need to look at this
*00:32-00:35*

with Orthodox eyes and understand it
*00:35-00:38*

from the position of the Church.
*00:38-00:40*

And it is right there that the first observation
*00:40-00:43*

needs to be made.
*00:43-00:45*

As Orthodox Christians, we confess every time
*00:45-00:48*

we open our mouths to proclaim the Creed
*00:48-00:50*

that there is one holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church.
*00:51-00:56*

The Church is singular and unique, as Christ is singular and unique, for the Church is
*00:56-01:04*

His body manifest in this world.
*01:04-01:07*

The Church is unchangeable and, importantly, indivisible, because Christ is unchangeable
*01:07-01:14*

and indivisible.
*01:14-01:15*

The Church must be one.
*01:16-01:18*

The Church cannot be divided into parties in conflict with each other any more than
*01:18-01:24*

Can Christ can be divided into parts in conflict with himself?
*01:24-01:29*

No.
*01:29-01:29*

The Church is one and this unity, this singularity is concrete.
*01:30-01:35*

It is not ephemeral.
*01:35-01:37*

It is not an idea.
*01:37-01:38*

It is not an ideal.
*01:38-01:39*

It is a reality of Christ's single body manifest in this world.
*01:40-01:47*

And we have to take in concert with that reality of unity, that second part, in this world.
*01:47-01:54*

The Church is not an intellectual idea, she is not a hope or an aspiration, she is not
*01:55-02:00*

a collective theology or collective ideology for like-minded or like-believing groups.
*02:00-02:07*

The Church is a concrete incarnate reality.
*02:08-02:11*

She exists in this world in the manner that God himself established her in his incarnate
*02:12-02:18*

life.
*02:18-02:18*

She is the concrete reality of her apostles, her bishops, her priests, her deacons, and
*02:19-02:26*

her faithful, sacramentally united in the one body of the one Church.
*02:26-02:33*

So when we confess as Orthodox Christians that one holy and Catholic and apostolic Church,
*02:34-02:41*

We are not confessing a generic idea to which multiple different organisms might subscribe.
*02:41-02:47*

We are confessing one concrete heavenly and earthly reality.
*02:48-02:54*

Now some might say an institution of men on this earth is not the same thing as the divine
*02:54-03:00*

reality of the Church.
*03:00-03:02*

But let us do away once and for all with this criticism.
*03:02-03:05*

The Church is not an institution made by man.
*03:06-03:08*

It is the singular reality made by the God-man, Christ himself.
*03:09-03:15*

It is composed of men and women, the fleshly creatures of this human life.
*03:16-03:21*

It is we who are in the Church, but we are not the creators of the Church, nor were the
*03:21-03:27*

apostles, nor have any of the saints created the Church.
*03:27-03:31*

The Church is God's own life bestowed on us in the manner of His direction.
*03:32-03:39*

It is not to be identified with whoever so desires to claim to be the Church.
*03:40-03:46*

It is to be identified solely and exclusively with that which Christ Himself fashioned and
*03:46-03:52*

said, "This is my Church."
*03:53-03:56*

This is the starting point for us.
*03:56-03:58*

This is the only reality that we can proclaim as Orthodox Christians.
*03:58-04:04*

Anything else is to do away with the Gospel, to do away with our living history and the
*04:05-04:11*

testimony of the Church through all her generations.
*04:11-04:14*

Now how does this relate to ecumenism?
*04:15-04:18*

Let me start by saying that ecumenical as a term is generally an internal term for us
*04:19-04:25*

as Orthodox Christians.
*04:25-04:26*

Historically, we have used that word to describe our life, not the life of our church in relationship
*04:26-04:33*

to other Christians or other religions, but the internal manifestation of our life.
*04:33-04:39*

It is an acknowledgment that this one church is spread out over the whole earth, and in
*04:39-04:45*

each place there are differences of custom and life and challenge and hope and fear based
*04:45-04:52*

on the political circumstances, the social milieu, persecutions, peace, etc.
*04:52-04:58*

In every place, the Church has her own unique challenges, her own unique strengths, but
*04:59-05:05*

the Church is ever one in that diversity.
*05:06-05:09*

And the Church uses the term ecumenical to refer to that wholeness, to refer to the whole
*05:10-05:16*

household and the term comes from Greek, "ikos" which means a house or a household and we
*05:16-05:22*

refer to the universal household of the Church.
*05:22-05:25*

All of us, even those who might be in a far-flung corner of the world whose lives are outwardly
*05:25-05:30*

somewhat different from ours, whose practices are outwardly perhaps different from ours.
*05:31-05:36*

Yet at the same time we are all the children of the one Church, the hierarchy united, the
*05:36-05:46*

singular, the truth singular, the church singular. This is how we use the term ecumenical. But
*05:46-05:56*

in more recent centuries, and certainly above all in the 19th and 20th and now well into
*05:56-06:02*

the 21st centuries, that root term has become an -ism that's taken on a very different
*06:02-06:10*

life, ecumenism, is understood, generally speaking, as the dialogue between many different
*06:10-06:18*

Christian entities, working, living, praying, functioning together, under the auspices or
*06:18-06:25*

the belief that overarching all of them in their diversity is this reality called the
*06:25-06:30*

church of which they are all a part without any one of them being exclusively the whole.
*06:30-06:37*

This is the nature of ecumenical dialogue that we find in the councils formed for these
*06:38-06:45*

purposes around the world, locally and internationally, and so on.
*06:45-06:49*

But this is something with which an Orthodox Christian simply can never agree.
*06:50-06:54*

We cannot for one second acknowledge that the Church is divisible into parts where those
*06:55-07:03*

parts are actually proclaiming differing truths.
*07:03-07:06*

We cannot, not for one instant, accept the concept of a church divided into parts that
*07:07-07:13*

live different lives, different approaches to the gospel, fundamentally different understandings
*07:13-07:21*

of what it means to be Christian and how and so on.
*07:21-07:24*

No, that is simply and unequivocally and will always be incompatible with the notion of
*07:24-07:32*

the Church, the reality of the Church, that we have received from Christ in his apostles.
*07:32-07:38*

The anathema service, as it's used in our Church on the Sunday of Orthodoxy, includes
*07:39-07:46*

in its present form an anathema against ecumenism.
*07:46-07:50*

This is something that the Synod of Bishops of the Church Abroad added in the last century.
*07:50-07:55*

But it's important to note precisely what is said about ecumenism as it is called anathema.
*07:55-08:01*

He said, "Those who believe that truth can be garnished from lots of different points
*08:01-08:06*

and collectively these together can be considered the Church which is a mixture of all of them
*08:06-08:13*

to this which we call ecumenism, anathema."
*08:13-08:17*

And some view anathemas as harsh to hear, but they are important.
*08:18-08:24*

They tell us concretely where are the limits of the church, the limits of our experience
*08:25-08:31*

of truth.
*08:32-08:33*

And if we believe that truth becomes an ephemeral idea, that the church becomes an ephemeral
*08:33-08:41*

idea, that it's really a conglomeration of lots of different entities who speak of
*08:41-08:46*

the truth differently and collectively are the church, then we have fallen outside the
*08:46-08:53*

definition of the church that Orthodoxy maintains. We maintain one church with her one sacramental
*08:53-09:02*

life. But can there be a good ecumenism? The question with which I opened. And I want to
*09:02-09:08*

say that the answer is yes, but of course it depends entirely on how we define that
*09:08-09:14*

term. Ecumenism from an Orthodox point of view must always be the confession and proclamation
*09:14-09:23*

of the singular Church that is Christ's body, His holy Orthodox Church, to those outside her,
*09:23-09:33*

who are understood as precisely that, to be outside the Church. They may be and often are
*09:33-09:42*

men and women of great goodwill, men and women of a deep love for Christ as they have been shown Him,
*09:42-09:49*

as they have been taught about him, but for whom the Orthodox Christian must always confess
*09:49-09:56*

as an essential ingredient of his life in the Church that there is more than what those
*09:56-10:03*

very often good people have yet to experience.
*10:03-10:07*

Indeed, the goodness of some of those people in many measurable ways may be greater and
*10:08-10:14*

even more exalted than the goodness of some of those in the Church.
*10:14-10:18*

This is a reality that we must acknowledge, which sometimes confuses people and throws
*10:18-10:24*

them for a loop.
*10:24-10:25*

Being grafted into the Church does not automatically make one holy or good or righteous.
*10:26-10:30*

One must live an ascetical life and be transformed through repentance.
*10:30-10:34*

And there are many who have not yet been grafted into this life who are struggling for Christ,
*10:35-10:41*

perhaps more than those who have been.
*10:42-10:44*

And yet, and yet, though that may well be true, there is more than the life in Christ
*10:45-10:53*

to which they have been hitherto exposed, and our ecumenical work must be to show them
*10:53-11:01*

that which is greater, to invite them into that which they have yet to become a part.
*11:01-11:08*

dialogue. And very many of us, I certainly don't like the term dialogue so much in the
*11:10-11:16*

modern day because it is too often used by those who want to dumb down the actual arguments
*11:16-11:23*

of all sides in order to find some common meeting point, the lowest common denominator
*11:23-11:29*

of theology or morality or some other practice. But dialogue can mean exactly what it says,
*11:29-11:35*

an interaction of words, an interaction of discussion and learning.
*11:35-11:40*

An Orthodox ecumenical dialogue can be good, can be positive, if it is practiced in this manner.
*11:40-11:48*

We confess and profess and proclaim the singular unity of the one Church of Christ.
*11:49-11:56*

This is the Holy Orthodox faith of the Apostles of their successors, which we, despite our
*11:56-12:03*

obvious unworthiness have inherited from them and guard and preserve in our lives.
*12:03-12:10*

This is what the world is missing.
*12:10-12:12*

And to those brothers and sisters in this human life who strive for Christ but are not
*12:13-12:19*

yet in the Church, let us speak to them with love, a love that does not seek to confirm
*12:19-12:26*

them in that separateness, to confirm them in the wants of what is greater, but instead
*12:26-12:33*

reveals to them that which is greater and invites them in.
*12:33-12:38*

For the church is ready to receive everyone, the greatest and the weakest, the smartest
*12:38-12:45*

and the least educated, those who are rich and those who are poor, those who have known
*12:45-12:51*

Christ in some form already, those who have never heard of Him, even those who have acted
*12:51-12:56*

against Him.
*12:56-12:57*

the gates of repentance, everyone is invited to walk.
*12:57-13:01*

And the Church is ready to graft into her body, to unite to Christ Himself fully and
*13:02-13:08*

wholly the whole world, if they are ready.
*13:08-13:12*

And we can help them in this.
*13:13-13:15*

Ecumenical dialogue in this sense is a missionary work.
*13:16-13:19*

It is not a watering down of our faith.
*13:20-13:22*

It is the injection of the truth of our faith into the world around us.
*13:23-13:28*

If an ecumenical discussion starts to take the flavor of simply putting Orthodox teaching
*13:29-13:34*

on par with Catholic or Anglican or Protestant or whatever other religion it might be, if
*13:35-13:40*

the fruit of some specific dialogue or discussion or conference or whatever it might be is simply
*13:40-13:46*

to compare like for like, we should back away because this is a falsehood and you cannot
*13:46-13:52*

participate in that kind of discussion authentically as an Orthodox Christian.
*13:52-13:57*

You are by definition watering down the teachings of the Church, denying the teachings of the
*13:57-14:03*

Church by acknowledging that they can be held like for like with any other.
*14:03-14:08*

No, our discussions must always take as the clear and unequivocal starting point that
*14:08-14:16*

that there is one and only one Church, and that our interest in discussions with other
*14:16-14:24*

Christians is to show them this truth, humbly and with love revealing to them that which
*14:24-14:30*

is yet wanting by those outside the Church, and showing them the path in.
*14:30-14:36*

May this missionary zeal inspire all of us.
*14:36-14:40*

Amen.
*14:41-14:41*
