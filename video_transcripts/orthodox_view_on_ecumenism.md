Bishop Irenei of London & Western Europe (ROCOR)

In this powerful reflection, Bishop Irenei responds to a question from a faithful Orthodox Christian in Mexico, explaining the true meaning of ecumenism, the difference between Orthodox unity and modern ecumenical efforts, and why Orthodox Christians cannot accept a diluted vision of the Church. This video dives deep into the teachings of the Ecumenical Councils, the meaning of “One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church,” and how Orthodox theology views dialogue, truth, and ecclesial identity.

in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
*00:00-00:02*

My dear brothers and sisters,
*00:03-00:04*

today I would like to respond to a question
*00:04-00:07*

I received in a letter from an Orthodox Christian in Mexico,
*00:07-00:11*

relating to a theme that we have touched on before,
*00:12-00:14*

but which is relevant in our modern social and ecclesial situation
*00:15-00:20*

to a degree that really warrants our coming back to it from time to time,
*00:20-00:24*

to look at it from different angles and perspectives.
*00:24-00:27*

And that theme that was put before me is ecumenism.
*00:27-00:30*

What is it?
*00:30-00:31*

And what is the appropriate Orthodox attitude towards it?
*00:31-00:35*

Let me give just a little background on the term,
*00:36-00:38*

because that helps us to understand this reality a little more closely.
*00:39-00:42*

Ecumenism, or ecumenical, comes from the root Greek word
*00:43-00:48*

"ekos," meaning house or household.
*00:48-00:51*

And therefore, ecumenism, at a literal definition,
*00:52-00:55*

means something that relates to the whole household of the Church, not something specific
*00:56-01:01*

to this place or that place or this question or that environment, but something that concerns
*01:01-01:07*

the whole.
*01:08-01:08*

And so there is, in the Orthodox understanding of this term historically used, a sense of
*01:09-01:16*

that universalism to the Church, that there are, of course, many things in the Church's
*01:16-01:22*

life where local attention is required. Indeed, the vast majority of the Church's focus is on the
*01:22-01:30*

local situation in a given place. This parish, this priest, this bishop, this Christian standing
*01:30-01:37*

before God. But there are important areas where the Church needs to concern herself with the whole,
*01:38-01:45*

that which touches upon every Orthodox faithful in every place in every time.
*01:46-01:52*

And this would be linguistically to use ecumenism in a wholly Orthodox way, to address and betake
*01:53-02:01*

ourselves to those circumstances, questions and needs that affect the whole of the Orthodox Church.
*02:01-02:09*

This is the linguistic meaning. However, it's worth pointing out that almost nobody
*02:09-02:15*

uses the term ecumenism in this way in our modern day. Before we get to how it is used,
*02:15-02:21*

let us look at the other form, ecumenical. Obviously related in its root and in its meaning,
*02:22-02:28*

the Orthodox Church across our history has chosen to apply this title of ecumenical,
*02:28-02:34*

this adjectival qualifier, to certain councils which she deems relevant to all Orthodox Christians
*02:34-02:44*

in every locale, every patriarchy, every jurisdiction, and in every generation.
*02:44-02:50*

There is a certain degree to which a council being called ecumenical, and we know we are the Church
*02:51-02:58*

of the Ecumenical Councils, a council being deemed ecumenical to some degree related to the attempt,
*02:58-03:06*

at least, to bring together all of the hierarchs from the whole of the Church into one place to
*03:06-03:12*

consider important topics. It's worth noting that none of the ecumenical counsellors were actually
*03:12-03:19*

universal in this sense. There has never been a council at which every single bishop of the church
*03:20-03:26*

was present. Much more important to the church's understanding of a council as ecumenical
*03:27-03:34*

has been the reception and the place of its reception in orthodox life. If we take, for
*03:34-03:42*

and the greatest of the ecumenical councils, that of Nicaea in AD 325.
*03:42-03:48*

It attempted to be the largest council in the history of the Church to that date,
*03:49-03:54*

and it certainly was.
*03:54-03:55*

It was also the first to have an imperial presence,
*03:56-04:00*

with the newly converted Emperor Constantine convening and drawing together this important council.
*04:00-04:06*

But it was not universal in the sense of having every single bishop of the church present.
*04:06-04:12*

This simply was not a practical possibility then,
*04:12-04:15*

when the number of bishops was much, much smaller than it is today.
*04:16-04:19*

Nor, it has to be said, was it immediately understood that the First Council, the Council in Nicaea,
*04:20-04:26*

would be considered ecumenical in that sense of touching upon everyone and every generation.
*04:27-04:32*

This was not considered a de facto outcome immediately after the Council.
*04:33-04:38*

Everyone recognized that the Council was important and significant, but only with time and through
*04:38-04:46*

the reception of the Church, largely through the voices and the aid of certain saints,
*04:46-04:53*

Saint Athanasius being one of the great voices that brought Nicaea into centrality, the Church
*04:53-05:00*

comes to assign this Council an ecumenical status, that is to say, what was done here
*05:00-05:06*

by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit through Christ the head of His Church, what was done here
*05:07-05:13*

in this place in response to this concern, touches upon everyone, not just people in Nicaea,
*05:14-05:21*

not just people in Asia or in the Balkans, but every Orthodox Christian everywhere and in every
*05:22-05:28*

regeneration. So the decisions of that Council, when it becomes ecumenical in the Church's
*05:28-05:34*

mind, are things which touch upon every time and every place. And thus we adhere as faithfully
*05:34-05:42*

as possible to these Councils even today, even though, as I said recording this, I am
*05:42-05:48*

in England, we are in the 21st century, a very different world than the one in which
*05:48-05:54*

Nicaea convened a very long time ago indeed, and yet it remains relevant even to us.
*05:54-06:02*

So we do use in orthodoxy the term ecumenical to relate to councils given this universal
*06:03-06:11*

status.
*06:12-06:12*

And there's one other use of the term ecumenical that we embrace in orthodoxy that I'd like
*06:13-06:17*

to touch on before we get to the version of ecumenism that we actually see in the world
*06:17-06:23*

around us.
*06:23-06:23*

And this other sense in which the Church has embraced for at least a good portion of her
*06:24-06:28*

history has been to give the title ecumenical to a certain bishop, one patriarch of the
*06:28-06:36*

Church that is chosen by the common consent of all the others, not by any divine right
*06:36-06:43*

or divine authority to one patriarchate within the grand scheme of the Church, but by the
*06:43-06:50*

consent of the Church, prayerfully and in her unity, to assign the obedience to one
*06:49-06:58*

of her bishops, to stand as a kind of focal point for the affairs of the whole community.
*06:58-07:05*

This patriarch, given the title ecumenical, again not from the earliest days, and for
*07:07-07:12*

the earliest generations of the Church, this title was not employed, and indeed when it
*07:13-07:18*

began to be employed was somewhat controversial and disliked by many sainted bishops.
*07:18-07:23*

However, when the term began to be used, it was not understood and has never rightly been
*07:24-07:31*

understood to imply that one bishop has an authority over other bishops, that one bishop
*07:31-07:38*

has a unique divine charism to foster and protect the unity of the Church.
*07:38-07:43*

This has never been the authentic understanding of an ecumenical patriarchate or an ecumenical
*07:44-07:50*

patriarch.
*07:50-07:51*

Rather, the role is one of honor and unity by which all the hierarchs, seeing in their
*07:52-08:00*

brother a good example of leadership and guidance, bestow on him a certain office through which
*08:00-08:08*

the unity of the church and the matters of the unity of the church can have a kind of
*08:08-08:13*

singular focal point. For example, whenever any group gets together to have a meeting or a council,
*08:13-08:21*

someone needs to chair the meeting. And it's the same with church councils, with episcopal councils,
*08:22-08:28*

with synods and sub-wars. When hierarchs come together for the sake of good order, there needs
*08:28-08:35*

to be someone who gathers them, who facilitates their meetings, their discussions, their prayer.
*08:35-08:43*

But this individual is not over them.
*08:43-08:46*

He has no charism of guidance over them.
*08:46-08:50*

The Spirit guides the councils and guides each bishop uniquely and directly in that
*08:50-08:57*

conciliar action.
*08:57-08:58*

There is no authority of any bishop, whatever his rank, over others.
*08:58-09:03*

It is the voice of the council, the voice of the hierarchy together that speaks with
*09:03-09:09*

the blessing of the Spirit.
*09:09-09:11*

And so this term ecumenical has been assigned to patriarchs throughout time in this way.
*09:12-09:18*

It is still recognized as being assigned to a patriarch even today by some parts of the
*09:18-09:23*

church.
*09:24-09:24*

As has always been the case, there are ebbs and flows in the way these things are received
*09:25-09:30*

and embraced by the whole of the ecumeny, the whole universal household of the Church.
*09:30-09:37*

But let's get to the focus on ecumenism that often concerns people.
*09:37-09:43*

As I mentioned, the definition I provided of ecumenism early on may be literary and
*09:43-09:49*

might be correct in that sense and orthodox in that sense, but one almost never hears
*09:49-09:54*

the term ecumenism being used this way in the actual day in which we live.
*09:54-10:00*

Rather, ecumenism now is almost universally taken to relate to a phenomenon of the late
*10:01-10:08*

twentieth century, and really of the last century or two, which is fundamentally a Protestant
*10:08-10:15*

understanding of ecclesiology.
*10:15-10:17*

to simplify this down to maybe its most bare-boned elements. This understanding is that the church
*10:18-10:26*

in her singularity, in her unity, is something abstract, something that cannot be identified
*10:26-10:34*

wholly or exclusively with any vision or version of the church that one sees on earth. All of these
*10:34-10:43*

might be part of the church, which is a kind of umbrella that embraces all of these variations
*10:43-10:50*

considering themselves to be Christian. But no single one of those can make that claim.
*10:51-10:59*

Rather, it is in the communion of the whole, of the whole household, and that's how the term is
*11:00-11:05*

used here. It is in that great communion of the whole in its diversity that the church is disclosed.
*11:05-11:15*

Now I hope it goes without saying to Orthodox Christians that this is fundamentally incompatible
*11:15-11:22*

with an understanding of the church that we have received from the apostles and from those very
*11:22-11:28*

councils called ecumenical that we mentioned before. This is not to say that the people who
*11:29-11:35*

subscribe to this are evil or bad. It is to say, however, that this is not a vision of
*11:34-11:40*

the Church that any Orthodox person can embrace. When we confess, as we do in the Creed, the
*11:40-11:48*

product of these ecumenical councils, when we confess one holy Catholic and apostolic
*11:48-11:55*

Church, this is not for us an abstracted idea that encompasses a large body of man-made
*11:55-12:02*

institutions. This is a direct reference to the institution fashioned by the God-man,
*12:02-12:10*

Jesus Christ, His Church, His Body, which exists today as it has since He founded it
*12:11-12:19*

amongst His Apostles. By the election and selection of those whom He ordains to be His
*12:19-12:26*

Apostles, their successors, who are set apart to be His priests, His deacons, and all the
*12:26-12:32*

ranks of ministry within the Church, this institution that we see, this concrete reality
*12:32-12:40*

of this hierarchical faith.
*12:41-12:44*

This is the one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and things which differ from this
*12:45-12:53*

are by virtue of that difference departing from the Church.
*12:53-12:58*

We can see in them, of course, degrees of adherence to the Gospel of Christ, to the
*12:59-13:04*

commandments of Christ, but the only way to be completely adherent to those commandments
*13:04-13:10*

of the Savior is to follow that which he instituted, and any departure from that is to a degree,
*13:10-13:18*

to that degree, to depart from his teaching.
*13:18-13:22*

So for Orthodox people, this understanding of ecumenism, that there are many different
*13:24-13:30*

Christian faiths which taken as a whole are the Church, this is not only incompatible,
*13:31-13:40*

not only different, but is in fact wrong.
*13:40-13:44*

And indeed on the service of the triumph of Orthodoxy in hierarchical settings, that is
*13:44-13:50*

to say in a cathedral where a ruling bishop presides and serves the full rite of orthodoxy,
*13:50-13:57*

in the anathemas the Church abroad has added for some decades now an anathema against ecumenism.
*13:57-14:06*

That is to say it is so completely contradictory to orthodox teaching that it needs to be held
*14:06-14:15*

up annually as something beyond which Christians are not able to go, in that area beyond which
*14:15-14:23*

Christians are not able to go. But in the anathema against ecumenism, it specifically says
*14:23-14:30*

that we are anathematizing those who believe that from the amalgamation of these many different
*14:31-14:37*

churches calling themselves Christian, there is something else, the church that is created,
*14:38-14:44*

against this anathema. So I hope this answers the concern that many people have which is why
*14:44-14:52*

ecumenism which on the one hand seems a very friendly and kind way to interact with other
*14:52-14:58*

Christian peoples, to dialogue, to speak etc. All of that of course orthodoxy has nothing against.
*14:59-15:06*

Not only that there is an imperative by Christ himself to speak in love to our brothers and
*15:06-15:13*

and sisters and to show them the truth.
*15:13-15:15*

For us, ecumenical dialogue always means exactly
*15:16-15:19*

and exclusively that, to speak about the truth
*15:19-15:24*

of the one Church of Christ to others,
*15:24-15:27*

to show them this light that we have so unworthily received.
*15:28-15:33*

And yet when ecumenism is seen as it so often is,
*15:34-15:37*

as an enterprise beholding the Church
*15:37-15:41*

as the creation of a mixture of what are fundamentally
*15:41-15:44*

human interpretations of Christ's gospel.
*15:45-15:48*

This is something that we cannot, we do not,
*15:49-15:53*

and we will not accept.
*15:53-15:55*

I pray that this little clarification might be useful
*15:56-16:00*

and helpful to some of you.
*16:01-16:03*

May God bless you.
*16:03-16:04*
