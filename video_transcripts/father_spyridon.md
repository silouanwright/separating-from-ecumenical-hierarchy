A short refelction on the nature of the Church and the origin of ecumenism.

If we are to understand the ecumenical movement, we have to first place it into context, our
*00:06-00:13*

understanding of the church and then where the ecumenical movement has its roots and
*00:13-00:17*

who planted those roots.
*00:17-00:18*

First let us remind ourselves that the church does not belong to man, it is not a creation
*00:20-00:25*

of man, it is God's alone.
*00:25-00:27*

We do not enter the church through a simple proclamation of faith, personal, individualised
*00:29-00:36*

faith, though faith is important, vital.
*00:36-00:39*

We enter the church through baptism and chrismation.
*00:40-00:43*

It is God that makes us members of the church.
*00:43-00:46*

We remind ourselves that the apostles, though they saw, they witnessed the risen Christ,
*00:47-00:52*

they touched him, they ate with him.
*00:54-00:55*

They were not yet the church, though they believed, though they had a faith.
*00:57-01:01*

They were made the church at Pentecost with the descent of the Holy Spirit.
*01:02-01:06*

We are made into members of the church by God.
*01:08-01:11*

There are people today who are being assured by their leaders that it is enough just to
*01:12-01:17*

personally believe and they are part of the church.
*01:17-01:20*

This has never been a part of Christian belief.
*01:21-01:24*

This is not the Church's teaching.
*01:24-01:26*

The Church is the body of Christ.
*01:29-01:30*

It cannot be divided.
*01:31-01:32*

It is impossible for the Church to be divided.
*01:33-01:35*

The Church can be wounded.
*01:37-01:38*

Even as the flesh of Christ was wounded, we may see the Church wounded from without and
*01:39-01:46*

within, but never divided.
*01:46-01:48*

There is in the Protestant Christian groups a belief in a thing called the 'branch theory'
*01:51-01:57*

- the idea that the church is separated into many, many branches. Of course, Protestants
*01:57-02:04*

must believe this, otherwise how else can they claim that bodies that they belong to
*02:04-02:08*

that didn't exist before the 1500s have any claim to being linked with the true Church
*02:09-02:16*

of Christ, except through personal faith of course. But the church does not believe this.
*02:16-02:23*

The church is one. There is only one church. Christ did not establish churches. He established
*02:23-02:30*

the church. One faith, one baptism. And so to suggest that the church is divided is to
*02:30-02:39*

teach that the body of Christ itself is divided. I would say this is blasphemy.
*02:39-02:46*

And the ecumenical movement, it teaches them that all these different branches have an equal claim
*02:48-02:54*

to being the church of Christ. But this outward show of unity is really empty, it is a superficial
*02:54-03:02*

unity. It has no depth because it lacks a shared faith, the faith of Christ, the truth, the living
*03:02-03:09*

presence of Christ. The ecumenical movement uses Christian terms like brotherhood, unity,
*03:09-03:18*

love. But these words are empty if it isn't a single shared faith. The ecumenical movement
*03:18-03:26*

would take the doctrines of the church and consider them as secondary, worthless. Doctrines
*03:26-03:32*

that seven ecumenical councils established and protected, that martyrs shed their blood
*03:32-03:38*

to protect and defend. The faith of Christ given to the apostles, protected through the centuries,
*03:38-03:44*

given to us to share with our descendants, our children. We must not let the ecumenical movement
*03:45-03:52*

stamp on the doctrines of Christ. And the ecumenical movement doesn't simply wish to
*03:53-04:01*

attack the church. It is more than this. The ecumenical movement stems from a kind of kaiolysium,
*04:01-04:09*

a belief in a worldly kingdom that will be built by men on earth, millenarianism, that
*04:11-04:17*

idea of a thousand year reign and so on. If we look at the dollar bill, it has the masonic
*04:17-04:24*

image of the pyramid with the final stone missing. This is a symbol of the kingdom yet
*04:24-04:31*

fulfilled and established by men, finally to be built. There was a Scottish group of
*04:31-04:39*

masons who printed in the 60s and 70s in America a magazine called the New Age. And this New
*04:39-04:46*

Age is at the heart of Masonic belief and it is at the heart of ecumenism. That all
*04:46-04:53*

churches will gather together, casting aside their differences of doctrine and belief.
*04:53-04:59*

The heart of orthodoxy is very different to these other Christian groups. We do not believe
*05:01-05:09*

simply in a worldly manifestation of our faith. Our faith is manifested in our lives and in our
*05:09-05:17*

worship and in our icons and our hymns, but more importantly it is the inward
*05:17-05:22*

transformation of our hearts that our faith brings in the life of the church.
*05:23-05:27*

We are being transformed through the sacraments, through God's grace within
*05:28-05:32*

the life of the church, that the image of God which was never destroyed, which was
*05:32-05:37*

scarred and marred by our sin, is being restored to the likeness of Christ once
*05:37-05:42*

more. We must discover the kingdom of God, not to build one on earth like some human
*05:42-05:48*

institution. The purpose of the church is not to change the world as such, but to change
*05:49-05:54*

us, transform us, through God's grace that we may be transformed into Christ-likeness
*05:54-06:01*

once more. That the kingdom of God within us may change us, that we may enter the eternal
*06:01-06:10*

kingdom of God at our death.
*06:10-06:12*

(bells ringing)
*06:42-06:45*
