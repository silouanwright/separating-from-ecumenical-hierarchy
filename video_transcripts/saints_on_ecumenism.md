"Only Christ's religion [Orthodoxy] unites and we all ought to pray that they come back to this faith and thus, the union will occur. This will not come about by believing that we are all the same thing... that all religions are the same. They are not the same..."

St. Porphyrios of Kafsokalivia, 'Healing the Soul: Saint Porphyrios as a Model for Our Lives' (pg. 101)

"I further direct that Orthodox Christians should not make it a practice to attend the services of other religious bodies, so that there be no confusion as to the teaching or doctrines."

St. Raphael of Brooklyn, The Most Useful Knowledge for the Orthodox Russian- American Young People' (pgs. 297-303).

"...the Orthodox Church, as the Body Christ, is the source and the foundation of the Sacraments and not the other way around. The Mysteries, or Sacraments, cannot be elevated above the Church, or examined outside the Body of the [Orthodox] Church."

St. Justin Popovic, 'Orthodox Faith and Life in ChristÂ° (pgs. 173-174)
