# Mixed Hierarchy During Iconoclasm: Practical Orthodox Responses

## The Exact Nuanced Situation You Described

During iconoclasm, there were complex situations where:
- **Patriarch/Bishop**: Iconoclastic (heretical)
- **Local Priest**: Orthodox in belief but **commemorating** the heretical patriarch/bishop in liturgy
- **Faithful**: Seeking to attend church and commune but facing spiritual contamination

## Documented Historical Responses

### Theodore the Studite's Monastery (815-821)
**Situation**: Emperor Leo V appointed iconoclastic bishops, but some individual priests/abbots initially tried to compromise.

**Theodore's Response**:
- **Complete refusal** to attend liturgies where iconoclastic hierarchy was commemorated
- **Instruction to followers**: "You must never accept anything they say uncritically, and neither should you enter into dialogue with heretics"
- **Practical measures**: Created separate liturgical life entirely

**His Monastery's Experience**:
- Abbot Leontios initially "adopted the iconoclast position and won over many individual monks to his party"
- **Orthodox monks' response**: Those who remained orthodox **refused to participate** in liturgies under the compromised abbot
- Theodore's monastery was eventually "filled with iconoclastic monks" - the orthodox monks were driven out rather than participate

### The Key Principle Demonstrated

**Commemoration = Communion with the Heretic**
- When a priest commemorates an iconoclastic patriarch/bishop in the diptychs during liturgy, the faithful attending that liturgy are considered to be in communion with the heretic
- The act of commemoration in the liturgy makes everyone present complicit in the heresy

## Practical Actions Taken by the Faithful

### 1. Complete Separation
- **"Two separate parties in the East having no communion with each other"**
- Orthodox faithful created entirely separate liturgical communities
- They followed deposed orthodox patriarchs rather than attend liturgies commemorating heretical replacements

### 2. Acceptance of Deprivation
- **Chose to go without liturgy** rather than attend services commemorating heretics
- Endured exile, persecution, and spiritual deprivation rather than compromise
- Theodore and followers suffered "scourging, imprisonment and exile" rather than participate

### 3. Underground Orthodox Networks
- Maintained communion with deposed orthodox hierarchs (like Patriarch Nikephoros)
- Created alternative structures led by confessing clergy who refused to commemorate heretics
- Laypeople played crucial roles: St. Theodosia (a nun) led resistance to icon destruction in 729, becoming one of the first iconoclast martyrs¹
- Common Christians maintained icons in homes despite imperial prohibition, creating underground preservation networks²

## The Spiritual Ramification Principle

**Historical Teaching**: 
- Attending liturgy where heretical hierarchy is commemorated = being in communion with heretics
- Even if the local priest is personally orthodox, his **act of commemoration** makes all attendees complicit
- **"Simply greeting a heretic makes us communicants in heresy"** - this applied liturgically through commemoration

## Why Attending Contaminated Liturgies Defiles the Faithful

The Orthodox faithful understood that attending liturgies where heretics were commemorated caused spiritual contamination through mystical participation. The canonical tradition establishes this clearly:

**Apostolic Canon 45**: "Let any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended"¹

**Apostolic Canon 65**: "If any cleric or layman enters into a synagogue of Jews, or of heretics, to pray, let the former be deposed and let the latter be excommunicated"²

**Canon 33 of Laodicea**: "No one shall join in prayers with heretics or schismatics"³

St. Basil the Great explained the theological reality: Those who separated from the church "no longer had the grace of the Holy Spirit upon them, since it could no longer be given when the continuity was broken."⁴ This means attending liturgy under heretical bishops = participating in graceless, spiritually dead ceremonies.

The faithful understood what Dr. Constantine Cavarnos articulates: "A heretical doctrine is a virus, a poison that leads to spiritual infection and results in spiritual death."⁵ Just as one avoids physical contagion, the Orthodox avoided spiritual contamination through heretical liturgies.

## What the Faithful Actually Did

Based on documented evidence:
1. **Refused to attend** liturgies where iconoclastic patriarchs/bishops were commemorated
2. **Accepted spiritual deprivation** (no communion, no liturgy) rather than compromise
3. **Sought out confessing clergy** who refused to commemorate heretics
4. **Created parallel church structures** with deposed orthodox hierarchs
5. **Endured persecution** rather than participate in "contaminated" liturgies

## The Vindication
- Those who maintained this separation were later vindicated when iconoclasm was condemned
- The Triumph of Orthodoxy (843) celebrated the restoration of icons and vindicated those who refused compromise
- Those who had compromised by commemorating heretics were seen as having betrayed the faith

**Bottom Line**: Historical precedent shows Orthodox faithful chose complete separation from liturgies commemorating heretical hierarchy, even when it meant going without communion and liturgy entirely, rather than risk spiritual contamination through participation. This pattern extends beyond iconoclasm—St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite was excommunicated in 1776 for similar "rigorism" before being canonized in 1955, demonstrating that what one generation condemns as extremism, the Church often later recognizes as faithfulness.¹

## ROCOR: A Modern Example of Separation Over Ecumenism

### Part 1: How ROCOR Functioned During Separation (1927-2007)

**Initial Break (1927)**:
- Metropolitan Sergius of Moscow demanded clergy pledge loyalty to the atheistic Soviet regime
- ROCOR bishops refused, viewing this as spiritual compromise
- Result: Complete administrative and later prayerful separation

**Creating a Parallel Church Structure**:
- Established independent Synod of Bishops as highest authority
- Created dioceses worldwide: North America, South America, Australia, Western Europe
- Built hundreds of parishes and monasteries serving Russian émigré communities
- Ordained their own bishops and clergy without reference to Moscow
- Maintained strict pre-revolutionary liturgical traditions and Julian calendar

**The 1983 Anathema Against Ecumenism**:
ROCOR formally condemned ecumenism as "the most pernicious of heresies," declaring:
- "To those who attack the Church of Christ by teaching that Christ's Church is divided into so-called 'branches'... Anathema"
- Rejected the World Council of Churches completely
- Refused communion with Orthodox churches participating in ecumenical activities
- Viewed ecumenism as "syncretism" - a dangerous mixing of truth with heresy

**"No Communion" Policy**:
- Maintained separation from Moscow Patriarchate AND other Orthodox churches involved in WCC
- Metropolitan Vitaly: While not declaring them "graceless," ROCOR avoided communion with ecumenically-involved Orthodox
- Created a complete parallel Orthodox life: liturgy, sacraments, monasticism, theological education

### Part 2: How ROCOR's Stance Changed (2007-Present)

**The 2007 Reunion**:
- Signed Act of Canonical Communion with Moscow Patriarchate on May 17, 2007
- First joint liturgy at Christ the Savior Cathedral with Patriarch Alexey II
- Based on Moscow's 2000 statement limiting ecumenical involvement

**Key Compromises Made**:
- Accepted that Moscow remains in World Council of Churches
- Joint statement claimed WCC has "no ecclesiological significance" 
- Both agreed to reject "branch theory" while Moscow continues ecumenical dialogue

**The Split Within ROCOR**:
- Some bishops, clergy, and faithful refused the reunion
- Formed "ROCOR-A" (Agafangel) and other splinter groups
- These groups maintain the pre-2007 anti-ecumenical stance
- View the reunion as betrayal of ROCOR's founding principles

**Current Tensions**:
- Moscow's continued WCC membership remains controversial
- Patriarch Kirill's 2016 meeting with Pope Francis shocked many
- Some argue ROCOR compromised its witness against ecumenism
- Others defend reunion as restoring canonical unity

**The Change in Practice**:
- Pre-2007: Complete separation from any ecumenically-involved Orthodox
- Post-2007: Communion with Moscow despite its ongoing ecumenical activities
- Justification: Moscow "officially" rejects branch theory while practicing ecumenical dialogue

**Relevance**: ROCOR's history shows both the possibility of maintaining complete separation (1927-2007) AND the pressures that lead to compromise. Their 80-year separation proves Orthodox can function independently when hierarchs embrace heresy/ecumenism. Their reunion reveals how difficult it is to maintain such separation indefinitely.
