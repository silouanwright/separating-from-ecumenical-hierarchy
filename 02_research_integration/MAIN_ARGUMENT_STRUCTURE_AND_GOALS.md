# Main Argument Document: Structure and Goals

## Primary Goal
Establish that when patriarchs and bishops who are ecumenists are commemorated in the Divine Liturgy, this constitutes grounds for not attending parishes where they are commemorated - even if the local priest personally disagrees with the heresy espoused by the hierarchs he commemorates.

## Target Audience
Laypeople who may not understand the theological significance of liturgical commemoration and its connection to spiritual unity with heretical hierarchs.

## Logical Flow (Step-by-Step Argument)

### 1. What is Liturgical Commemoration?
- Explain the commemoration process in simple terms
- Show that ALL Orthodox churches commemorate their bishops and patriarchs
- Detail exactly when and how this happens in the liturgy
- Make clear this is universal Orthodox practice

### 2. Commemoration Creates Spiritual Unity
- Establish the theological principle that commemorating someone unites you with them
- Use patristic sources and canon law
- Address the main objection: "Just because you go to church and participate in Holy Communion, that has nothing to do with the patriarch and bishop"
- Show this objection is theologically false

### 3. Ecumenism is Worse Than Iconoclasm
- Present Fr. Theodore Zisis's declaration
- Explain why ecumenism is considered worse
- Establish proportionality - if true, then response should be at least as strong as during iconoclasm

### 4. Orthodox Response During Iconoclasm
- Detail what Orthodox faithful did when iconoclastic bishops were commemorated
- Show they refused to attend such churches entirely
- Provide specific historical examples with citations
- Establish this as the historical Orthodox precedent

### 5. The Kollyvades Vindication
- Use this to neutralize "legalism" and "extremism" objections
- Show how St. Nikodemos was condemned as rigorist then canonized
- Establish that strict adherence to tradition is often vindicated

### 6. Lay Authority to Make These Decisions
- Address objection that laypeople can't make such judgments
- Show canonical support for lay resistance to heretical bishops
- Historical examples of lay saints who did exactly this

### 7. ROCOR's Historical Witness (Pre-2007)
- Show that ROCOR itself practiced this principle for 80 years
- Document their separation from Moscow Patriarchate over ecumenism
- Their 1983 Anathema Against Ecumenism
- Establish that ROCOR agreed with and practiced these principles

### 8. ROCOR's Current Ecumenical Participation
- Prove that Patriarch Kirill is an ecumenist
- Document ROCOR's 2007 reunion despite ongoing ecumenism
- Show specific ecumenical actions post-reunion
- Establish that ROCOR parishioners now participate in what the document has shown to be spiritually dangerous

### 9. Why this cannot be compared to what the Old Calendarist schismatics are doing

### 10. Practical Application and Conclusion
- What this means for contemporary Orthodox
- Distinction between separation and schism
- Practical guidance while maintaining canonical order

## Key Objectives for Each Section

1. **Clarity**: Each principle must be explained simply enough for laypeople
2. **Documentation**: Every claim must have Orthodox sources and citations
3. **Logical Progression**: Each section builds on the previous one
4. **Address Objections**: Preemptively answer common counterarguments
5. **Practical Application**: Show this isn't just theory but requires action

## Writing Strategy

- Edit section by section
- Ensure smooth transitions between sections
- Use historical examples to illustrate abstract principles
- Include enough detail to be convincing without overwhelming
- Maintain focus on the main argument throughout

## Research Needs

1. Detailed explanation of liturgical commemoration practices
2. More primary sources on ecumenism as heresy
3. Specific documentation of Patriarch Kirill's ecumenical activities
4. ROCOR's official statements pre and post 2007

## Success Criteria

The document succeeds if a skeptical Orthodox layperson can:
1. Understand what commemoration is and why it matters
2. See the historical precedent for separation
3. Recognize that ROCOR once agreed with this position
4. Understand why attending ROCOR churches now participates in ecumenism
5. Feel equipped to make an informed decision based on Orthodox tradition
