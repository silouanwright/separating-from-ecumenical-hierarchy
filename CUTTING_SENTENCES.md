# Cutting Sentences: What Orthodox Faithful Hear When They Try to Follow Their Conscience

## From Priests:

"Maria, I'm concerned about your family's spiritual welfare. You're depriving your children of the sacraments over theological technicalities you don't understand."

"I've been a priest for 20 years. Do you really think your internet research trumps my theological education?"

"You're being manipulated by schismatic websites."

## From Family:

"Maria, you're tearing our family apart over theology the kids don't even understand. I support the priest - he's a good man. Can't you just ignore what happens at the diocesan level?" (Husband)

"In my 70 years as Orthodox, I've never seen such disrespect for the Church. You're teaching my grandchildren to rebel against authority. This is pure American individualism, not Orthodoxy." (Mother-in-law)

"My grandfather suffered under the Communists to preserve this Church, and you're abandoning it over some patriarch you've never met? You're dishonoring the martyrs." (Cradle Orthodox neighbor)

"Any quote can be twisted to mean anything if you rip it out of its historical context like you're doing."

"You're proof-texting the Fathers the same way fundamentalists proof-text Scripture."

"You're doing eisegesis with the Fathers - reading your own ideas into their words instead of letting them speak for themselves."

"Any seminary student could debunk your patristic 'research' in five minutes. This is amateur hour theology."

"You're treating patristic quotes like fortune cookies - pulling out what sounds good and ignoring everything else they taught."

"Those people you're quoting were saints, Maria. You're not a saint."

"Are you a saint? Because that's what you'd have to be to act like St. Maximus or St. Theodore."

"The saints had special grace and calling that you don't have. You can't just imitate their actions."

"Saints like St. Athanasius were given extraordinary grace for extraordinary times. You're not living in those times."

"You think you're on the same spiritual level as the Confessor saints? That's pure delusion."

"Those were saints who were persecuted for their holiness. You're just causing problems in a normal parish."

"The saints you quote were proven by miracles and martyrdom. What have you done to prove your spiritual authority?"

"Saint Theodore had visions and divine revelation. Are you claiming the same spiritual gifts?"

"The saints were humble and obedient until God called them to resistance. You're just being rebellious."

"You're comparing yourself to saints while acting with obvious pride and self-will."

"The saints waited for divine confirmation before taking such drastic action. Where's yours?"

"Those saints were recognized by the Church for their holiness. You're just recognized for causing problems."

"The saints suffered martyrdom for their positions. Are you willing to die for yours?"

"You're using the saints as an excuse to follow your own will instead of submitting to authority."

- "True obedience doesn't pick and choose which teachings to follow."
- "The saints obeyed even when their bishops were wrong - that's real Orthodox obedience."
