# Iconoclasm Research Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains theological research examining whether separation from ROCOR (Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia) is justified according to Orthodox tradition. The research traces a theological argument from historical iconoclasm through ROCOR's own history to validate a personal decision to separate from ROCOR over ecumenical concerns.

## Core Thesis
The project aims to demonstrate that:
1. During iconoclasm, Orthodox faithful separated from churches where heretical patriarchs/bishops were commemorated - even when local priests were personally orthodox
2. ROCOR itself followed this exact principle for 80 years (1927-2007), separating from Moscow over ecumenism
3. ROCOR's 2007 reunion with Moscow (despite ongoing ecumenical activities) represents abandonment of this witness
4. Therefore, separation from ROCOR is both historically grounded AND consistent with ROCOR's own previous example

## Research Goals
1. Document what Orthodox faithful actually did during iconoclasm when facing "mixed hierarchies" (orthodox priests under heretical bishops)
2. Establish the theological principle that commemorating heretics in liturgy creates spiritual communion with them
3. Show how ROCOR embodied this principle through their 1983 Anathema Against Ecumenism
4. Document how ROCOR's stance changed in 2007 by accepting communion with ecumenically-active Moscow
5. Validate that separation from ROCOR follows both patristic tradition AND ROCOR's own historical witness

## Personal Context
As someone currently in ROCOR, this research seeks to determine whether the tradition of the Church and the saints supports separation from ROCOR given their acceptance of communion with the ecumenically-active Moscow Patriarchate. The goal is to ensure any decision is grounded in authentic Orthodox tradition rather than personal preference.

### CRITICAL: Start Here for New AI Sessions

**If you are a new AI starting work on this project, read these files IMMEDIATELY in this order:**

1. **`/04_project_management/AI_MEMORY_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Complete project understanding and context
2. **`/02_research_integration/SECTION_WRITING_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_LAYPEOPLE.md`** - Essential writing standards and methodology 
3. **`/04_project_management/CRITICAL_GAPS_FOR_NEW_AI.md`** - Known structural issues and missing elements
4. **`/04_project_management/REMAINING_TASKS_DETAILED.md`** - Current task priorities and status

### Main Working Document

**`/01_core_argument/MAIN_ARGUMENT_DOCUMENT.md`** - The primary document being developed
- Contains the unified argument laypeople will read
- Sections 1-3 completed using enhanced methodology
- Sections 4-8 need completion using same standards

### Key Supporting Files

**Project Management:**
- `/04_project_management/research_documents_reviewed.md` - Integration status of all research
- `/02_research_integration/MAIN_ARGUMENT_STRUCTURE_AND_GOALS.md` - Document planning framework

**Writing Standards (ESSENTIAL):**
- `/02_research_integration/SECTION_WRITING_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_LAYPEOPLE.md` - Contains "Critical Additions from Practical Experience" section with proven methodology

**Research Sources:**
- `/research/` folder - 15 research documents (5 integrated, 10 pending)
- `/02_research_integration/` folder - Completed integration documents with citations
- `/05_completed_sections/` folder - Reference materials and extracted insights

### Current Status & Next Steps

**Completed Work:**
- Sections 1-3 of main document using enhanced "airtight proof" methodology
- File organization into logical folder structure  
- Integration of 5 major research documents

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. Complete Section 4: "Orthodox Response During Iconoclasm" 
2. Review remaining research documents in `/research/` folder
3. Address remaining high-priority tasks listed in REMAINING_TASKS_DETAILED.md

### Critical Methodology Notes

**MUST follow these standards established through practical experience:**
- **Airtight Proof Requirement** - Every assertion needs direct Orthodox source quotes
- **Logical Chain Building** - Each section explicitly connects to previous sections
- **Canonical Violation Frame** - Show attendance at compromised liturgies violates specific Orthodox canons
- **Research Integration** - Always check existing research documents before making claims

**Quality Control:** Use the "Ultimate Test" - Could a layperson use this section to convince their priest by quoting Orthodox sources directly?

### Warning: Read Instructions First

**DO NOT begin writing or editing without first reading the instruction files above.** The methodology has been refined through practical experience and deviating from established standards will produce inferior results.

**The project uses specific language requirements, canonical precision standards, and burden-of-proof flipping techniques that must be understood before proceeding.**
