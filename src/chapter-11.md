## Chapter 11: "We Have to Be Obedient to Our Bishops/Priests..."

### The Orthodox Teaching on Conditional Episcopal Obedience

Orthodox tradition firmly establishes that episcopal authority derives from faithfulness to apostolic teaching, not merely from ordination. The patristic consensus demonstrates that bishops who depart from Orthodox doctrine forfeit their spiritual authority even while retaining formal office.

**St. John Chrysostom articulated this principle with striking clarity: "What then, you say, when he is wicked should we obey? Wicked? In what sense? If indeed in regard to Faith, flee and avoid him; not only if he be a man, but even if he be an angel come down from Heaven."**¹ This teaching appears consistently across the patristic witnesses, establishing the conditional nature of episcopal obedience.

### The Patristic Framework: When Bishops Lose Their Authority

**Metropolitan Augustine Kantiotis synthesized centuries of Orthodox teaching: "The bishop must obey the Gospel. This is why when the Bishop is ordained, he is ordained under the Gospel. As the Fathers say, this means that the people shall obey the Bishop on one condition – that the Bishop obey the Gospel. But when the Bishop does not obey the Gospel and does not do according to the Holy Canons, then the clergy and the people are not obliged to obey the Bishop."**²

This principle is not theoretical but was demonstrated through the actions of the Church Fathers themselves. **St. Athanasius the Great resisted imperial pressure and heretical bishops throughout his life, enduring five exiles rather than compromise with Arianism.**³ His resistance demonstrated that maintaining Orthodox faith takes precedence over institutional obedience.

**St. Maximus the Confessor, though a layman, refused communion with the heretical patriarchs of Constantinople, stating during his trial: "The Holy Spirit, through the apostle, condemns even angels who innovate in some way contrary to what is preached."**⁴ He suffered torture and death rather than accept the monothelite heresy, later vindicated when the Sixth Ecumenical Council condemned his persecutors.

### The Canonical Foundation: Orthodox Law Protects Those Who Resist

**Canon 15 of the First-Second Council of Constantinople (861) stands as the cornerstone text, declaring that those who withdraw from communion with bishops preaching condemned heresies "not only are not subject to any canonical penalty... but, on the contrary, they shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians. For they have defied, not Bishops, but pseudo-bishops and pseudo-teachers."**⁵

This canon establishes crucial principles:
- The heresy must be one already condemned by councils or Fathers
- The bishop must be teaching it "publicly, and bareheaded in church" – meaning openly and officially
- Those who resist are not creating schism but "have been sedulous to rescue the Church from schisms and divisions"

**The Apostolic Canons reinforce this framework:**
- **Apostolic Canon 45**: "Let any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended"⁶
- **Apostolic Canon 46**: "We ordain that a bishop or presbyter who has admitted heretics' baptism or sacrifice be deposed"⁷

### Historical Vindication: The Arian Crisis as Paradigm

The fourth-century Arian controversy provides the paradigmatic example of justified lay resistance. **As Cardinal Newman meticulously documented, during this period "the Catholic people, in the length and breadth of Christendom, were the obstinate champions of Catholic truth, and the bishops were not."**⁸ 

**When approximately 400 Western bishops signed Arian formulas at Ariminum in 359, prompting St. Jerome's lament that "the whole world groaned and marvelled to find itself Arian," it was primarily the lay faithful who preserved orthodoxy.**⁹

Orthodox Christians demonstrated their resistance through concrete actions:
- In Alexandria, they refused communion with the Arian bishop George of Laodicea, gathering instead in cemetery chapels
- In Samosata, the entire population – "whether poor or rich, servants or mechanics, husbandmen or gardeners, men or women, young or old" – refused communion with the Arian appointee
- Many suffered torture and death rather than accept Arian baptism

This period established the principle of the sensus fidelium – that the Holy Spirit guides the entire Church, not merely its hierarchy. **As Newman concluded, during the Arian crisis "the Divine tradition committed to the infallible Church was proclaimed and maintained far more by the faithful laity than by the teaching hierarchy."**¹⁰

### Contemporary Orthodox Authority on Episcopal Obedience

Modern Orthodox theologians continue to affirm these principles. **Fr. Theodore Zisis, Professor Emeritus of Patristics at the University of Thessaloniki, writes: "One is not obliged to obey a heretical bishop. There is such a thing as bad obedience and good disobedience... If things were otherwise, there would be no Church today because heretical Patriarchs, Bishops, and clergy throughout the ages would have enforced heresy through the convocation of heretical councils."**¹¹

**Elder Athanasios Mitilinaios taught: "The people of God must become knowledgeable about the dogmatic teachings of the Church... so that if at some point priests, bishops or patriarchs maneuver in a heretical manner, the people of God can and must reprove them."**¹²

### The Orthodox Distinction: Obedience vs. Blind Submission

Orthodox spirituality distinguishes sharply between proper obedience and blind submission through the crucial virtue of diakrisis (discernment). **St. John Climacus defines this as "understanding of the divine will" that develops gradually through spiritual maturity.**¹³

**St. Nicodemus of Mount Athos taught: "If your elder is mistaken in the affairs of the state and its institutions, do not be curious. If, however, he is wrong in matters of the Faith, leave and abandon him, be he a man or even an angel from heaven."**¹⁴

### Practical Application: When Episcopal Obedience Ceases

Orthodox tradition provides clear criteria for when episcopal authority loses its binding force:

1. **Teaching condemned heresies publicly** - When bishops openly proclaim doctrines already condemned by councils or Fathers
2. **Persistent refusal to recant** - After being warned about their errors by other Orthodox bishops
3. **Breaking communion with Orthodoxy** - Through official acts of communion with heretical bodies
4. **Leading others into error** - Using their position to compel participation in heretical worship

The Mount Athos resistance to ecumenism demonstrates contemporary application, with numerous Athonite cells ceasing commemoration of patriarchs deemed to compromise Orthodox ecclesiology while remaining within the broader Orthodox communion. This "walling off" follows canonical precedent while avoiding schism.

### The Theological Foundation: Authority Requires Orthodoxy

The Orthodox position maintains that:
- **Episcopal authority is not absolute but conditional on Orthodox faith**
- **Apostolic succession requires apostolic faith, not merely ordination**
- **Laypeople have both the right and duty to resist heretical bishops**
- **Canon law explicitly protects those who cease commemorating heretical hierarchs**
- **Historical precedent demonstrates repeated vindication of those who resisted**

Orthodox Christianity thus provides clear authorization and guidance for resisting heretical bishops while maintaining hope for restoration. The numerous examples of saints who practiced "holy disobedience" demonstrate that such resistance, far from being rebellion, represents fidelity to the Church's true nature and mission.
