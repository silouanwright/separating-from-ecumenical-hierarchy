## Chapter 11: "We Have to Be Obedient to Our Bishops/Priests..."

Maria hadn't expected the confrontation to come from Mrs. Papadopoulos, the elderly parish council member who'd been attending Holy Trinity for forty years.

"Maria, I need to talk to you," she said after the church coffee hour, her voice carrying the authority of someone who'd outlasted three priests and two bishops. "You've been missing liturgy, and people are starting to talk."

Maria felt her stomach tighten. She'd hoped to avoid this conversation, but Mrs. Papadopoulos had cornered her near the kitchen where she couldn't escape easily.

"I know you think you understand these theological things because you converted," Mrs. Papadopoulos continued, her tone becoming sharper. "But you're just a single mother. You don't have the education or experience to be questioning our bishops and priests. We've been Orthodox for generations, and we've always obeyed our bishops. That's how the Church works."

### The Weaponization of Obedience

Maria took a deep breath. She'd seen this pattern before—the weaponization of "obedience" to silence legitimate Orthodox concerns. But her months of research had prepared her for exactly this objection.

"Mrs. Papadopoulos, I understand your concern about obedience," Maria began carefully. "But can I share what I've learned about Orthodox teaching on episcopal authority?"

The older woman crossed her arms. "I suppose you're going to tell me that laypeople know better than bishops?"

"Actually, I want to show you what the Church Fathers and saints teach about when bishops fall into heresy," Maria replied. "Because Orthodox obedience has always been conditional on Orthodox faith."

### The Patristic Framework: Episcopal Authority Requires Orthodox Faith

Maria pulled out her phone and found her research notes. "The Church Fathers were very clear about this. **St. Athanasius taught that Arian bishops had forfeited their apostolic authority through heresy—that apostolic succession requires apostolic faith, and bishops without apostolic faith forfeit their claim to apostolic succession.**¹

"**St. John Chrysostom wrote in 'On the Priesthood' that bishops who destroy multitudes through false teaching face severe judgment, indicating that episcopal authority depends on orthodoxy and moral integrity.**² The Eastern Fathers developed clear criteria: episcopal authority terminates through formal embrace of heretical doctrine, persistent refusal to recant after warnings, or breaking communion with the orthodox church."

Mrs. Papadopoulos frowned. "But those were ancient heresies. Our bishops today aren't heretics."

"That's exactly what I thought too," Maria said. "But look at what Fr. Theodore Zisis teaches—he's Professor Emeritus of Patristics at the University of Thessaloniki, one of the most respected Orthodox theologians alive."

### Contemporary Orthodox Authority: Fr. Theodore Zisis on Episcopal Obedience

Maria found the key passage she'd been looking for. "**Fr. Zisis writes: 'One is not obliged to obey a heretical bishop. There is such a thing as bad obedience and good disobedience... If things were otherwise, there would be no Church today because heretical Patriarchs, Bishops, and clergy throughout the ages would have enforced heresy through the convocation of heretical councils.'**³

"He's saying that blind obedience to bishops would have destroyed the Church throughout history. **The Orthodox position is that we obey bishops when they teach Orthodoxy, but we have the right—and duty—to resist when they preach heresy.**"

Mrs. Papadopoulos shifted uncomfortably. "But how can you as a layperson judge what's heresy and what isn't?"

### The Ultimate Precedent: St. Maximus the Confessor

Maria had been waiting for this question. "Let me tell you about St. Maximus the Confessor. **He was a layman—never ordained to the priesthood—who opposed all five Eastern Patriarchs when they embraced the Monothelite heresy.**⁴

"When they interrogated him about opposing the universal hierarchy, **he replied: 'When all the people in Babylon were worshipping the golden idol, the Three Holy Children did not condemn anyone to perdition. They did not concern themselves with the doings of others, but took care only for themselves, lest they should fall away from true piety.'**⁵

"Even facing torture and death, **he declared: 'Even if the whole universe holds communion with the Patriarch, I will not communicate with him.'**⁶ The Sixth Ecumenical Council later vindicated him and condemned the patriarchs he had opposed."

Mrs. Papadopoulos was quiet for a moment. "But that was... different. Those were ecumenical councils and major heresies."

### The Canonical Foundation: Canon 15 and Orthodox Law

"Actually, the Orthodox canons specifically address this situation," Maria said, pulling up another passage. "**Canon 15 of the First-Second Council explicitly states that those who separate from bishops 'preaching the heresy publicly, and teaching it bareheaded in church' are 'not subject to any canonical penalty' but should be 'deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians.'**⁷

"**Apostolic Canon 31 reinforces this principle: those who 'separate from their bishop before a synodical investigation because he himself is preaching some misbelief and heresy publicly, not only are not subject to the above penances, but have a right to claim the honor due to Orthodox Christians.'**⁸

"The distinction is crucial—**private disagreement requires synodical process, but public heresy demands immediate separation.**"

### The Medical Analogy: When Doctors Compromise Medical Science

Maria could see Mrs. Papadopoulos was struggling with this, so she tried a different approach.

"Let me put it this way," she said gently. "If your doctor started recommending treatments that contradicted established medical science—if he told you smoking was healthy or that vaccines were poison—would you continue following his medical advice just because he had a medical degree?"

"Well, no, of course not," Mrs. Papadopoulos admitted.

"That's exactly how Orthodox tradition approaches bishops who embrace heresy. **The Church Fathers taught that heretical bishops retain their sacramental powers but lose their legitimate episcopal authority.**⁹ They're still technically bishops, but they're no longer reliable guides for Orthodox faith."

### The Authority Accumulation: Overwhelming Orthodox Consensus

Maria continued building her case. "This isn't just one or two Church Fathers. **St. Basil the Great's canonical letters provided detailed pastoral guidance, establishing that those under heretical bishops should seek communion with orthodox clergy while avoiding direct confrontation.**¹⁰

"**St. Athanasius consistently advised avoiding communion with heretical bishops during his exiles, maintaining that 'The Church could have no communion with heretics who attacked the divinity of Christ.'**¹¹ His Festal Letters, written during exile, instructed the faithful to resist heretical appointments while maintaining unity among themselves.

"**The Apostolic Canons codified these prohibitions precisely. Canon 45 suspended clergy who merely prayed with heretics, while Canon 46 commanded deposition for those who received 'the baptism, or the sacrifice of heretics.'**¹² These canons balanced the need for clear boundaries with pastoral concern for those trapped under heretical oversight."

### The Historical Pattern: Laypeople Preserving Orthodoxy

Mrs. Papadopoulos was listening more carefully now. Maria pressed her advantage.

"Throughout Orthodox history, there's a striking pattern: **when bishops fell into heresy, ordinary believers preserved the faith.**¹³ During the Arian crisis, **when Emperor Constantius II favored Arian bishops and most of the episcopal hierarchy compromised, ordinary Christians became the guardians of Nicene orthodoxy.**¹⁴

"In Alexandria, **the faithful refused to accept the Arian bishop Gregory of Cappadocia, and holy virgins chose martyrdom over Arian communion.**¹⁵ In Samosata, **when an Arian bishop was installed, 'none of the inhabitants of the city, whether poor or rich, servants or mechanics, husbandmen or gardeners, men or women, young or old, would hold communion' with him.**¹⁶

"**As Cardinal Newman later observed, during this period 'the governing body of the Church came short, and the governed were pre-eminent in faith, zeal, courage, and constancy.'**¹⁷ The laity's theological sophistication appeared in their arguments—they understood that apostolic succession requires apostolic faith."

### The Business Partnership Analogy: Spiritual Contamination Through Obedience

Maria could see she was making progress, so she tried another analogy Mrs. Papadopoulos might understand.

"Think of it like a business partnership," she said. "When you commemorate a bishop in liturgy, you're essentially signing your name to a spiritual partnership. You become responsible for what your partner does. **As St. Theodore the Studite taught, commemoration creates unavoidable spiritual unity.**¹⁸

"**The Mt. Athos fathers explained this perfectly in their letter to Emperor Michael VIII: 'How can the Orthodox soul tolerate these things? How can he not sever communion with those who do commemorate him?'**¹⁹ They understood that obedience to heretical bishops actually violates Orthodox faith."

### Contemporary Example: Fr. Zisis and Episcopal Persecution

"This isn't just ancient history," Maria continued. "**Fr. Theodore Zisis himself ceased commemorating his metropolitan when the bishop embraced ecumenism. He wrote: 'My priestly conscience cannot bear the fact that on the day when the Church of the Holy Fathers and the Holy Councils condemns all the heresies... you recognize heresies as churches.'**²⁰

"**The metropolitan immediately suspended him, stripped his titles, and excommunicated him—despite Canon 15 explicitly protecting such action.**²¹ But Fr. Zisis understood that **true obedience sometimes requires disobedience to corrupted authority.**"

### The Orthodox Understanding: Good Disobedience vs. Bad Obedience

Mrs. Papadopoulos was quiet for a long moment. Finally, she asked, "So you're saying that disobeying bishops can sometimes be the Orthodox thing to do?"

"**The Orthodox tradition teaches there is 'bad obedience and good disobedience,' as Fr. Zisis explains in his book of the same title.**²² Bad obedience follows authority that leads away from Orthodox truth. Good disobedience refuses to participate in spiritual contamination.

"**St. Mark of Ephesus summarized this principle perfectly: 'All the teachers of the Church, all the councils, and all of Holy Scripture incites us to flee from the heterodox and not to have communion with them.'**²³ He urged Orthodox Christians to flee the heretically-minded 'as someone would flee from snakes.'"

### The Family Protection Analogy: Defending Orthodox Children

Maria tried one more approach she hoped would resonate. "Mrs. Papadopoulos, if a stranger came to your house claiming to be your family, would you let them influence your children just because they wore the right clothes and spoke politely?"

"Of course not," the older woman replied.

"That's exactly how Orthodox tradition views heretical bishops. **They may wear episcopal vestments and speak religious language, but they're teaching spiritual poison to our children.**²⁴ **St. Theodore the Studite wrote: 'Communion with heretics is poison that blackens and darkens the soul.'**²⁵

"**The Church Fathers were unanimous: the faithful must avoid communion with heretical bishops to protect their souls and their children's souls.**²⁶ That's not rebellion—that's Orthodox faithfulness."

### The Vindication Pattern: Orthodox Tradition Consistently Validates Resistance

Mrs. Papadopoulos seemed to be processing this information. Maria decided to address her underlying concern about being "extreme."

"I know this seems scary," she said gently. "But **Orthodox tradition consistently vindicates those who resist heretical hierarchy.**²⁷ **St. Athanasius was exiled five times for opposing Arian bishops, but the Church canonized him as a saint.**²⁸ **St. Maximus was tortured and had his tongue cut out for opposing heretical patriarchs, but the Sixth Ecumenical Council vindicated him.**²⁹

"**The Kollyvades movement was persecuted as 'extremist' and 'rigorist' in the 1700s, but their leader St. Nikodemos was canonized in 1955.**³⁰ **Elder Gabriel of Mount Dionysiou noted that those who resist change often 'constitute the most patriotic part' of the Church.**³¹

"**The pattern is clear: Orthodox tradition eventually vindicates those who maintain strict Orthodox positions.**"

### The Leverage Reality: When Bishops Notice Orthodox Concerns

Mrs. Papadopoulos had been listening thoughtfully. Now she asked, "But what can we actually do? We're just laypeople."

Maria smiled. "**Actually, laypeople have tremendous power in this situation. Bishops notice immediately when collection plates empty and pews are vacant.**³² **As the Orthodox theology affirms, 'Authority in the Church is never the monopoly of an ordained few... Authority is the responsibility of all.'**³³

"**The 'Grace-endowed people' serve as 'the ultimate criterion of Orthodoxy,' with 'their acceptance of a Synod's decisions that establishes the correctness and recognition of that Synod.'**³⁴ **When hierarchs compromise through ecumenical accommodations, the faithful bear responsibility for maintaining orthodoxy.**³⁵

"**Orthodox brotherhoods throughout history have organized resistance to hierarchical compromise—during the Union of Brest, under Ottoman rule, through Communist persecution.**³⁶ **Modern examples include resistance to the calendar reform of 1924, when about one-fourth of Greece's population refused the change.**³⁷"

### The Burden-Flipping Conclusion: Who's Really Abandoning Orthodox Tradition?

As their conversation was drawing to a close, Maria offered her final thought.

"Mrs. Papadopoulos, I understand your concern about obedience. But we need to ask: **who's really abandoning Orthodox tradition? Those who refuse to participate in prayers with heretics, as the Apostolic Canons require? Or those who insist we must commune with bishops who embrace ecumenism?**

"**The canons don't make exceptions for 'supporting your priest' or 'maintaining parish unity.' The Orthodox position has always been clear: we cannot avoid canonical violations by claiming good intentions.**

"**When I stay home from liturgy where heretical bishops are commemorated, I'm following 1,700 years of Orthodox precedent. I'm not rebelling against the Church—I'm being faithful to the Church that the saints died to preserve.**"

Mrs. Papadopoulos was quiet for a long moment. Finally, she sighed. "I need to think about this, Maria. This isn't what I expected to hear."

"I understand," Maria replied gently. "It wasn't what I expected to learn either. But **the Orthodox tradition is clear: obedience to bishops requires them to teach Orthodox faith. When they abandon Orthodoxy, faithful resistance becomes our duty to Christ and to our children.**"
