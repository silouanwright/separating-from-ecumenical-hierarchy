### The Patriarch ROCOR Commemorates by Name

**Video documentation shows Patriarch Kirill bowing to Pope Francis and receiving his "blessing."**¹⁶⁴ **ROCOR commemorates this man by name in every liturgy**.

**News reports documented**: **"As is customary in Russian Tradition, Patriarch Kirill and Pope Francis greeted each other with 3 kisses on the cheek. It is an embrace that has taken nearly 1000 years to occur"**¹⁶⁶. The exchange included **"Thanks brother"** and Pope Francis declaring **"We are brothers, we have the same baptism, we are bishops"**¹⁶⁶.

During the Great Entrance, ROCOR priests pray: **"For His Holiness Kirill, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, our Most Reverend Metropolitan Hilarion..."** This creates spiritual communion with everything Patriarch Kirill believes and practices. As we established in Chapters 1 and 2, liturgical commemoration makes worshippers spiritually united with their bishops' theological positions and ecclesiastical activities.

**Here's what ROCOR congregations unite themselves with every Sunday**:

#### Video Evidence: Kirill Bowing to and Receiving Papal "Blessing"

**February 12, 2016** - Patriarch Kirill met Pope Francis in Havana, Cuba. **The video documentation shows Patriarch Kirill bowing to Pope Francis and receiving his "blessing"** - demonstrating **recognition of papal grace and authority**.

**This acknowledges papal spiritual legitimacy** in direct violation of Orthodox teaching about heretical ordinations. **When Orthodox bishops bow to heretical bishops and receive their "blessings," they recognize heretical sacramental authority**.

**But the video evidence is just the beginning**. **At the same meeting, Kirill signed written declarations that make his heretical position explicit**.

#### The Havana Declaration: Kirill's Written Heresies

**At the same meeting, Kirill signed an official declaration containing explicit heresies**. **Kirill personally declared**:

> **"It is with joy that we have met like brothers in the Christian faith"**

**This violates fundamental Orthodox teaching**. Orthodox Christians cannot be **"brothers in faith"** with those who hold heretical beliefs about the Trinity, salvation, and Church authority. **St. John Chrysostom** commanded: **"Be aware not to be corrupted from love of the heretics; for this reason do not accept any false belief in the name of love."** **St. Ignatius of Antioch** taught: **"It is fitting, therefore, that you should keep aloof from such persons."**

#### Kirill's "Loss of Unity" Heresy

**In the same Havana Declaration, Kirill signed**:

> **"We are pained by the loss of unity, the outcome of human weakness and of sin, which has occurred despite the priestly prayer of Christ the Saviour... Mindful of the permanence of many obstacles, it is our hope that our meeting may contribute to the re-establishment of this unity willed by God, for which Christ prayed."**

**This denies basic Orthodox ecclesiology**. Orthodox teaching maintains that **Christ's prayer for unity is always fulfilled in the Orthodox Church**. **The "unity" wasn't "lost" requiring "re-establishment"** - **Papists fell away from the ever-existing unity of the Orthodox Church**.

**Fr. Emmanuel Hatzidakis explains**: **"The unity for which Christ prayed is always existent. It doesn't need to be re-established! The Papists fell away from the ever-existing saving unity of the Orthodox Church!"**

#### Kirill's "Common Mission" Partnership

**Kirill further declared**:

> **"Orthodox and Catholics are united not only by the shared Tradition of the Church of the first millennium, but also by the mission to preach the Gospel of Christ in the world today."**

**This implies equal validity** of Orthodox and Catholic evangelization, suggesting both preach the true Gospel despite fundamental doctrinal differences. **Orthodox teaching maintains that heretics have no authority to preach the Gospel** - they actually **reject the true Gospel**.

**St. Mark of Ephesus** declared: **"It is impossible to recall peace without dissolving the cause of the schism—the primacy of the Pope."** **Heretics need conversion to Orthodoxy, not partnership in "common mission."**

**Kirill's heretical statements go beyond even these explicit violations**.

**Most damning of all**: **The Moscow Patriarchate Synod of November-December 2017 gave "synodal" praise to this apostatic Havana Declaration**¹⁶⁵. This wasn't just one patriarch's personal error - **the entire Moscow Patriarchate synodally endorsed these heresies**, making the institutional apostasy complete.

#### Additional Havana Declaration Heresies

**Kirill also signed even more explicit heretical language**:

> **"Our fraternal meeting has taken place in Cuba"**¹²³ **"We share the same spiritual Tradition of the first millennium of Christianity"**¹²⁴ and declared their intent to **"work together fraternally"**¹²⁵ in proclamation.

**This creates formal spiritual brotherhood with heretics** - directly contradicting Orthodox teaching that Catholics are heretics lacking valid sacraments, not "brothers" with shared apostolic tradition. **Even Pope Francis himself declared at the meeting**: **"We speak as brothers, we have the same Baptism, we are bishops"**¹²⁶ - explicitly affirming the "branch theory" heresy that ROCOR's own 1983 Anathema condemns.

#### Ongoing World Council of Churches Leadership

**Patriarch Kirill remains actively involved in World Council of Churches leadership and ecumenical dialogue**. The Moscow Patriarchate **never withdrew from WCC membership** despite reunion with ROCOR, whose **1983 Anathema specifically condemned WCC participation**.

#### Contemporary "Neo-Sergianism" Under Putin

**The Moscow Patriarchate demonstrates contemporary Sergianism through church subordination to state power**¹⁷¹. Kirill has blessed the 2022 Ukraine invasion as a **"metaphysical struggle" and "Holy War,"** telling soldiers that **"sacrifice in the course of carrying out your military duty washes away all sins"**¹⁷¹. The March 2024 World Russian People's Council officially declared the invasion aimed at **destroying Ukrainian independence** - a theological justification for territorial conquest¹⁷¹.

**Financial dependencies reinforce institutional capture**: The church receives **"multimillion state subsidies"** through major state corporations, with Metropolitan Tikhon reportedly receiving funding from **"almost all state corporations"**¹⁷².

**These aren't isolated incidents** - they represent **systematic participation in activities ROCOR once anathematized**.

**The evidence of Kirill's violations leads to an unavoidable conclusion about ROCOR's liturgical commemoration**.

### The Spiritual Communion Reality

**As we established in Chapters 1 and 2**: When Orthodox Christians attend liturgy where bishops are commemorated, **they become spiritually united** with everything those bishops believe and practice. **There's no way to separate yourself mentally** from the liturgical structure.

**When ROCOR priests commemorate Patriarch Kirill by name**, everyone present **participates spiritually** in Kirill's declaration that the Pope is his **"brother in Christian faith"** and his signing of documents that **deny Orthodox ecclesiology**.

**The canonical chain works exactly as we described**:
- **Patriarch Kirill** signs heretical documents with the Pope
- **ROCOR bishops** commemorate Patriarch Kirill despite these violations
- **ROCOR priests** commemorate ROCOR bishops who commemorate Kirill
- **ROCOR congregations** participate in liturgies that unite them spiritually with this entire compromised hierarchy

**Attending ROCOR parishes creates spiritual communion** with Patriarch Kirill's ecumenical activities. **This is unavoidable** given the liturgical structure of Orthodox commemoration.

### ROCOR's Own 1983 Anathema Condemns This

**ROCOR's theological contradiction becomes undeniable** when we examine their own official teachings against their current practice.

**ROCOR's 1983 Anathema Against Ecumenism officially declared**:

> **"To those who attack the Church of Christ by teaching that Christ's Church is divided into so-called 'branches' which differ in doctrine and way of life, or that the Church does not exist visibly, but will be formed in the future when all 'branches' or sects or denominations, and even religions will be united into one body; and who do not distinguish the priesthood and mysteries of the Church from those of the heretics, but say that the baptism and eucharist of heretics is effectual for salvation; therefore, to those who knowingly have communion with these aforementioned heretics or who advocate, disseminate, or defend their new heresy of Ecumenism under the pretext of brotherly love or the supposed unification of separated Christians: Anathema!"**

**Notice the crucial phrase**: **"those who knowingly have communion with these aforementioned heretics."** ROCOR officially declared that **having communion with heretics deserves anathema**.

**But now ROCOR maintains communion with Patriarch Kirill**, who:
- **"Knowingly has communion with heretics"** (meets with Pope Francis as "brother in faith")
- **"Advocates and defends the heresy of Ecumenism"** (signs ecumenical declarations)
- **Does this "under the pretext of brotherly love"** (exact language from Havana Declaration)

**By ROCOR's own 1983 definition, Patriarch Kirill deserves anathema. By ROCOR's current practice, they maintain communion with someone their own anathema condemns.**

**This is theological schizophrenia**: **Officially condemning what they officially practice**.

**The Orthodox response to these violations confirms what the evidence already shows**.

### Orthodox Authority Confirms the Canonical Violation

**Three unassailable types of Orthodox authority** all confirm that ROCOR's commemoration of Patriarch Kirill violates Orthodox canons.

#### Episcopal Authority: Bishop Longin Actually Stopped Commemorating Kirill

**Bishop Longin of Bancheny** (Serbian Orthodox Church), widely respected for his **traditional Orthodox positions** and **personal holiness**, **officially ceased commemorating Patriarch Kirill** following the **February 12, 2016 Havana Declaration** with Pope Francis.

**Bishop Longin's March 10, 2016 canonical analysis was devastating**¹⁶¹. He declared **"The declaration is nothing other than a betrayal of Orthodoxy, a legalization of the teachings of Antichrist, and that the 'all-Russian' Patriarch, who placed his signature under it, committed 'canonical crime'"**¹⁶¹.

**Bishop Longin specifically condemned the Havana Declaration**, stating: **"The signing of the declaration in Cuba is a betrayal and violation of the Orthodox faith...these 30 points are Judas' thirty pieces of silver...I never will be in unity with heretics. I am Orthodox and I will not become a traitor"**¹⁶¹.

**Most significantly, he emphasized the secretive nature** as evidence of canonical impropriety: **"This was prepared secretly, and that means a secret iniquity exists...the pope became a brother to His Holiness, and we, Orthodox, have become his enemies"**¹³².

**The February 19, 2016 action by 12 Moldovan priests and 2 monasteries** provides sophisticated canonical precedent¹⁶². **These clergy formally invoked Canon 15 of the First-Second Synod of Constantinople (861)** which permits cessation when a hierarch proclaims **"heresy bareheaded [γυμνῇ τῇ κεφαλῇ]"**¹⁶².

**Their formal defense document stated**: **"Acting within the strict requirements of the Canon Law of the Orthodox Church, we state that the unique cause of our own cessation of commemoration...is the public and open preaching of heresy on their part"**¹⁶². They specifically identified **"lost unity of Christians" language**, **recognition of "other Christian churches"**, and **World Council of Churches participation** as heretical positions¹⁶².

**This demonstrates what authentic Orthodox response looks like**. **When bishops violate Orthodox canons through ecumenical activities, faithful Orthodox bishops cease commemorating them**.

#### Saintly Authority: Elder Gabriel Applies Orthodox Canons Directly

**The most authoritative contemporary Orthodox critique** comes from **Elder Gabriel, a direct disciple of St. Paisios of Mt. Athos** - one of the most revered Orthodox saints of the 20th century.

**Elder Gabriel was asked directly**: **"What do you say about Patriarch Kirill and Putin?"**

His response was canonically devastating:

> **"If they believe that the Pope is a church and has mysteries and we have to unite, they aren't shepherds but wolves in shepherds clothing. Whoever, the Patriarch or the archbishop is, who says something that the fathers and the gospel haven't said... when they say that the Pope is a church and has mysteries and we have to unite... even if he fasts... even if he prophesies... even if he practices virginity... does signs... does miracles... he's a wolf and not a shepherd... [According to] St. Ignatius the God-bearer."**¹³⁷

**Elder Gabriel's framework is ironclad because it addresses any defense**: **Even if hierarchs appear personally holy through fasting, prophecy, or miracles**, when they teach union with heretics **they become "wolves in shepherds clothing" according to St. Ignatius the God-bearer**¹³⁸.

**Elder Gabriel then applied the canonical penalty directly**:

> **"What does the Church say; the 45th Apostolic Canon: 'If a bishop, or a presbyter, or a deacon, while assembled with a heretic, jointly prays with heretics, he is excommunicated and deposed.'"**¹³⁹

**Elder Gabriel's interpretation leaves no room for compromise**: **"The Ukrainian schismatics are not priests, they are blasphemers...If they don't repent, they won't be saved, and those who have Eucharistic communion with them and concelebrate with them also won't be able to inherit salvation"**¹⁴⁰.

**Most devastatingly for ROCOR's position, Elder Gabriel states**: **"Many hierarchs pray and concelebrate with heretics...our bishops, who pray and concelebrate with heretics and schismatics, behave like traitors"**¹⁴¹.

**When shown that Patriarch Kirill performs liturgy with Catholics present**, Elder Gabriel confirmed: **"Of course! They (the papists) need to leave the Church or we shouldn't be there, we are jointly praying. We are excommunicated by the (45th) canon"**¹⁴².

**This represents absolute canonical clarity from a disciple of St. Paisios**: **Any Orthodox hierarch who permits heretics to remain during liturgy becomes "excommunicated by the canon"** - meaning **canonically deposed according to Apostolic Canon 45**¹⁴³.

**Elder Gabriel also invoked the three types of atheism according to St. Gregory Palamas**¹⁶⁴: **"The first type of atheism, the atheist who says God does not exist. The second type of atheism is the heretic. Third type of atheism is when the faith is in danger and I am silent... I don't speak up."** He added St. Theodore the Studite's commandment: **"It's a Commandment from God to not be silent, do not stay silent when the faith is in danger. We shouldn't be silent"**¹⁶⁴.

**This is a disciple of St. Paisios applying Apostolic Canon 45 directly to Patriarch Kirill's ecumenical activities**. **When ROCOR commemorates Kirill**, they maintain communion with someone whom **a spiritual son of St. Paisios** identifies as **canonically excommunicated**.

#### Academic Authority: Theological Framework Confirms Violation

**Fr. Theodore Zisis** (Professor Emeritus of Patristics) provides the academic theological framework confirming that **ecumenical participation requires cessation of commemoration** according to Orthodox canonical tradition.

**When saintly lineage, episcopal authority, and academic expertise all confirm the same canonical principle**, ROCOR's commemoration of Kirill becomes **canonically indefensible**.

**The research reveals a critical finding**: **ROCOR has issued no official synodal statements justifying their commemoration of Patriarch Kirill despite his clear violations of their 1983 Anathema**¹⁴⁴. Instead, they rely on:
- Individual bishop statements claiming "canonical obligation"¹⁴⁵
- Clergy explanations distinguishing between "commemoration and agreement"¹⁴⁶  
- Strategic avoidance of addressing the fundamental contradiction¹⁴⁷

**This silence is particularly damning** given that Patriarch Kirill served as Chairman of External Church Relations since the 1970s¹⁴⁸, WCC Central Committee member since 1975¹⁴⁹, and Moscow Patriarchate's primary ecumenical representative¹⁵⁰.

**The overwhelming contemporary Orthodox consensus** validates everything ROCOR once believed. **Multiple unassailable Orthodox authorities** all confirm the canonical necessity of ceasing ecumenical commemoration.

**This Orthodox consensus becomes even more devastating when applied to ROCOR's own history**.

### The Faithful Who Refused: ROCOR vs ROCOR

**Not everyone in ROCOR accepted this betrayal of their founding principles**. **When ROCOR leadership signed the 2007 Act of Canonical Communion** with Moscow, **faithful Orthodox did exactly what Chapters 1-8 demonstrate**: **They applied ROCOR's own canonical principles consistently**.

**The embarrassing reality for current ROCOR**: **Other Orthodox bishops follow ROCOR's own former principles** while **ROCOR abandons them**.

#### Bishop Agathangel and the Faithful Resistance

**Bishop Agathangel (Pashkovsky) of Odessa**, despite initially supporting reunion, **reversed course when he saw the canonical implications**. On **May 22, 2007**, he declared he **"does not accept the document"** of canonical communion, applying **Canon 15** and **ROCOR's own 1983 Anathema Against Ecumenism**.

**The faithful resistance formed around ROCOR's own theological foundations**:
- **Applied the 1983 Anathema** against those who **"have communion with heretics"**
- **Cited Apostolic Canons 45 and 46** prohibiting prayer with heretics
- **Invoked Canon 15** protecting those who separate from heretical bishops
- **Referenced Metropolitan Vitaly's warnings** against ecumenical compromise

**Archbishop Andronik (Kotliaroff)** and **Archbishop Sophronius (Musienko)** were consecrated **December 7-8, 2007** to maintain **authentic ROCOR witness** when official ROCOR abandoned its principles.

#### Worldwide Orthodox Resistance Using ROCOR's Own Theology

**The geographic resistance** spanned **Ukraine, United States, Canada, Russia, and South America** - showing faithful ROCOR members worldwide **independently applied the same canonical principles** established in Chapters 1-8.

**These faithful Orthodox formed "ROCOR-A" (Agafangel)** and other groups that **maintain the pre-2007 anti-ecumenical stance**. **They viewed the reunion as betrayal of ROCOR's founding principles** - and they were right.

**This resistance validates everything we've established**: When Orthodox hierarchs compromise with heretics, **faithful Orthodox separate using canonical authority**. **ROCOR's own faithful** applied **ROCOR's own theology** against **ROCOR's institutional betrayal**.

#### The Tragic Irony

**The split within ROCOR proves** that the 2007 reunion **violated ROCOR's theological integrity**. **Faithful ROCOR members** had to **separate from ROCOR** to **maintain ROCOR's original principles**.

**Current ROCOR claims to be the "traditional" Orthodox jurisdiction** while **treating their own faithful as schismatics** when they **maintain ROCOR's original anti-ecumenical principles**.

**Bishop Longin** represents what ROCOR **used to be**. **ROCOR-A** represents what ROCOR **used to be**. **Current ROCOR** represents what ROCOR **criticized in others** for 80 years.

### The 2007 Betrayal: How This Happened

**On May 17, 2007**, ROCOR signed the **Act of Canonical Communion** with Moscow Patriarchate, ending 80 years of principled separation. **But Moscow never abandoned the activities** that justified ROCOR's original separation.

**What ROCOR accepted in 2007**:
- **Moscow's continued World Council of Churches membership**
- **Ongoing ecumenical dialogue activities**
- **Failure to condemn Sergianism or communist collaboration** - no synodal decision has ever condemned the 1927 Declaration¹⁶⁷
- **Political subservience to Putin's regime** with Kirill describing Putin's rule as **"a miracle of God"**¹⁶⁸
- **The 1969 decision** allowing Catholics to receive Orthodox communion (never revoked)¹⁷⁵
- **Continued veneration of Soviet collaborators** - in 2017, Kirill dedicated a statue to Metropolitan Sergius, praising him as someone who **"worthily passed his way of the cross as a Patriarch"**¹⁶⁹. This is catastrophic: **Kirill praises the very man whose betrayal caused ROCOR's 80-year separation**, the man who pledged "absolute loyalty" to the atheist regime murdering Orthodox Christians

**ROCOR's justification**: Moscow **"officially" rejects the branch theory** while **continuing to practice ecumenical activities**. They claimed this addressed their **"primary concerns."**

**Medical analogy**: **If a doctor officially condemns poison** while **continuing to prescribe poison**, **has he really changed?** Moscow's **"official" rejection** means nothing while they **continue practicing** what they officially reject.

**The institutional pattern remains identical**: Moscow **still honors Metropolitan Sergius** (with **Patriarch Kirill dedicating a statue to Sergius in 2017**), just as ecumenical patriarchs receive institutional protection despite canonical violations.

### The Unrepented Sergianist Betrayal

**This cannot be overstated**: **Patriarch Kirill actively venerates the very man whose betrayal caused ROCOR to separate for 80 years**. In 2017, Kirill didn't just tolerate Sergius's memory - he **dedicated a statue** to him, praising Sergius as someone who **"worthily passed his way of the cross as a Patriarch"**¹⁶⁹. The local governor even called Sergius **"a true saint of our land"**¹⁶⁹.

**Consider what this means**: Metropolitan Sergius pledged **"absolute loyalty"** to the atheist Soviet regime that was actively murdering Orthodox Christians. His 1927 Declaration proclaimed that Orthodox believers must recognize **"the Soviet Union as our civil motherland, whose joys and successes are our joys and successes"**¹⁷³ - while that same regime was executing priests and destroying churches.

**Historical perspective**: When Metropolitan Sergius issued his 1927 Declaration, **up to 90% of Orthodox parishes initially rejected it**¹⁷⁰. Approximately **2,500 parishes joined Metropolitan Joseph of Petrograd's resistance movement**¹⁷⁰. The underground "Catacomb Church" emerged rather than accept this compromise. **ROCOR formally broke communion on September 5, 1927**, declaring Moscow's administration **"enslaved by the godless Soviet power"**¹⁷⁶.

**Orthodox theologians identified Sergianism as an ecclesiological heresy**¹⁷³ - a distorted understanding whereby the church serves the world by conforming to it rather than transforming it. **Boris Talantov**, who died in Soviet prison for his writings, explained that Sergianism created **"a false separation of all the spiritual needs of man into the purely religious and the socio-political"**¹⁷³.

**Yet in 2007, ROCOR accepted reunion with Moscow** despite:
- Moscow never condemning this foundational betrayal
- Patriarch Kirill actively praising Sergius as a holy example
- The same Sergianist pattern continuing with Putin's regime

### The Question That Destroys Everything

**Here's the question that makes ROCOR's current position impossible**:

**If Bishop Longin is wrong** to cease commemorating Patriarch Kirill over ecumenical violations, **then ROCOR was wrong** to separate from Moscow for 80 years over the same theological principles.

**If Bishop Longin is right** to cease commemorating Patriarch Kirill, **then ROCOR is wrong** to maintain communion with Moscow despite ongoing ecumenical violations.

**There's no middle ground**. **Either the canonical principles matter or they don't**.

**When ROCOR members learn about Bishop Longin**, they face impossible questions:

1. **Is Bishop Longin wrong** to cease commemorating Patriarch Kirill over ecumenical violations?
2. **If Bishop Longin is right**, why does ROCOR continue commemorating Kirill?
3. **If ecumenical violations justify ceasing commemoration**, why did ROCOR reunite with Moscow in the first place?

**Most ROCOR members** either:
- **Know Bishop Longin is correct** but won't admit it because it destroys their position
- **Dismiss him as "too legalistic"** - **the exact same accusation** made against the Kollyvades Fathers (who were later canonized)

**History will vindicate Bishop Longin** just as it vindicated the Kollyvades. **The same pattern repeats**: **Faithful Orthodox who apply canons strictly** get condemned as "rigorists," then **later proved right**.

### Nowhere Left to Run: Complete Institutional Collapse

**ROCOR spent 80 years** teaching their faithful that **ecumenical participation disqualifies hierarchs** from Orthodox communion. **Then in 2007**, ROCOR leadership **demanded that their faithful abandon** everything they had been taught.

**This is pastoral betrayal**: **Teaching people Orthodox principles for 80 years**, then **condemning them for following those principles**.

**The devastating reality becomes clear**: **Even the "most traditional" Orthodox jurisdiction** now **violates the canonical principles** that once defined them. **ROCOR is no longer traditional** - they're **institutionally compromised**.

**When people tell Orthodox faithful "Don't be too strict about commemorating Kirill,"** remember:

- **Bishop Longin** - a widely respected Orthodox bishop - **ceased commemorating Kirill** for exactly these reasons
- **ROCOR-A bishops and faithful** - who **maintained ROCOR's original principles** - **separated from current ROCOR** for exactly these reasons
- **Elder Gabriel** - a disciple of St. Paisios - **applies Orthodox canons directly** confirming these violations

**Following their canonical example isn't being "more strict than Orthodox bishops"** - **it's following authentic Orthodox tradition**.

**Current ROCOR asks their faithful** to **violate the very canons** that **justified ROCOR's existence for 80 years**. **Attending ROCOR parishes now violates** the same canonical principles that **justified ROCOR's separation from Moscow for 80 years**.

**The choice becomes unavoidable**: Follow ROCOR's current institutional convenience, or follow ROCOR's proven 80-year canonical witness - **which means separating from current ROCOR**.

*[Content consolidated into earlier sections of Chapter 9]*

**Think about what this means**:

**Bishop Longin** - a widely respected Serbian bishop known for his holiness - **literally stopped commemorating Patriarch Kirill** for violating Orthodox canons through ecumenical activities.

**ROCOR** - supposedly the "traditional" jurisdiction that spent 80 years opposing exactly these activities - **continues commemorating Patriarch Kirill** despite his worse ecumenical violations.

**Who's really following Orthodox tradition?**

### The Uncomfortable Questions ROCOR Can't Answer

**When ROCOR members learn about Bishop Longin**, they face impossible questions:

1. **Is Bishop Longin wrong** to cease commemorating Patriarch Kirill over ecumenical violations?
2. **If Bishop Longin is right**, why does ROCOR continue commemorating Kirill?
3. **If ecumenical violations justify ceasing commemoration**, why did ROCOR reunite with Moscow in the first place?

**Most ROCOR members** either:
- **Know Bishop Longin is correct** but won't admit it because it destroys their position
- **Dismiss him as "too legalistic"** - **the exact same accusation** made against the Kollyvades Fathers we discussed in section 5

### The Kollyvades Pattern Repeats

**Remember section 5**: The Kollyvades were condemned as "rigorists" and "troublemakers" for defending Orthodox tradition, then later canonized.

**The same pattern happens today**:
- **Bishop Longin** applies Orthodox canons strictly and ceases commemorating heretical patriarchs
- **ROCOR members** dismiss him as "too strict" or "legalistic"
- **History will vindicate Bishop Longin** just as it vindicated the Kollyvades

**But here's the crucial difference**: **The Kollyvades faced opposition from compromised hierarchy**. **Bishop Longin faces opposition from ROCOR** - a jurisdiction that supposedly agrees with his theological principles!

### ROCOR's Theological Schizophrenia

**ROCOR's 1983 Anathema** declared: **"To those who knowingly have communion with these aforementioned heretics or who advocate, disseminate, or defend their new heresy of Ecumenism... Anathema!"**

**ROCOR now maintains communion** with Patriarch Kirill, who **"knowingly has communion with heretics"** and **"advocates and defends ecumenism"** through:
- **World Council of Churches membership and leadership**
- **Signed ecumenical declarations with the Pope**
- **Regular meetings with Protestant and Catholic leaders**
- **Official participation in ecumenical dialogue**

**By ROCOR's own 1983 definition**, **Patriarch Kirill deserves anathema**. **By ROCOR's current practice**, **they maintain communion with someone their own anathema condemns**.

**This is theological schizophrenia**: **Officially condemning what you officially practice**.

### The ROCOR-A Vindication: Some Refused the Betrayal

**Not everyone in ROCOR accepted the 2007 betrayal**. **Some bishops, clergy, and faithful** refused the reunion, forming **"ROCOR-A" (Agafangel)** and other groups that **maintain the pre-2007 anti-ecumenical stance**.⁸⁶

**These groups viewed the reunion as betrayal of ROCOR's founding principles** - and they were right. **They represent what ROCOR used to be** before institutional compromise corrupted their witness.

**The split within ROCOR proves** that the 2007 reunion **violated ROCOR's theological integrity**. **Faithful ROCOR members** had to **separate from ROCOR** to **maintain ROCOR's original principles**.

### The Embarrassing Reality: ROCOR vs. ROCOR

**ROCOR claims to be the "traditional" Orthodox jurisdiction** in America. But when a genuinely traditional bishop **actually applies the canonical principles** ROCOR once championed, **ROCOR members dismiss him**.

**When ROCOR's own faithful** maintain **ROCOR's original anti-ecumenical principles**, **current ROCOR** treats them as **schismatics**.

### The 2007 Faithful Resistance: Orthodox Applied ROCOR's Own Principles

**When ROCOR leadership signed the Act of Canonical Communion** with Moscow, **faithful Orthodox did exactly what sections 1-8 demonstrate**: **They applied ROCOR's own canonical principles consistently**.

**Bishop Agathangel (Pashkovsky) of Odessa**, despite initially supporting reunion, **reversed course when he saw the canonical implications**. On **May 22, 2007**, he declared he **"does not accept the document"** of canonical communion, applying **Canon 15** and **ROCOR's own 1983 Anathema Against Ecumenism**.¹⁶⁵

**The faithful resistance formed around ROCOR's own theological foundations:**
- **Applied the 1983 Anathema** against those who **"have communion with heretics"**
- **Cited Apostolic Canons 45 and 46** prohibiting prayer with heretics
- **Invoked Canon 15** protecting those who separate from heretical bishops
- **Referenced Metropolitan Vitaly's warnings** against ecumenical compromise¹⁶⁶

**Archbishop Andronik (Kotliaroff)** and **Archbishop Sophronius (Musienko)** were consecrated **December 7-8, 2007** to maintain **authentic ROCOR witness** when official ROCOR abandoned its principles.¹⁶⁷

**The geographic resistance** spanned **Ukraine, United States, Canada, Russia, and South America** - showing faithful ROCOR members worldwide **independently applied the same canonical principles** we've established in sections 1-8.¹⁶⁸

**This resistance validates everything we've argued**: When Orthodox hierarchs compromise with heretics, **faithful Orthodox separate using canonical authority**. **ROCOR's own faithful** applied **ROCOR's own theology** against **ROCOR's institutional betrayal**.

**This reveals the truth**: **ROCOR is no longer traditional** - they're **institutionally compromised**. They maintain **the appearance of traditionalism** while **violating the canonical principles** that once defined them.

**Bishop Longin** represents what ROCOR **used to be**. **ROCOR-A** represents what ROCOR **used to be**. **Current ROCOR** represents what ROCOR **criticized in others** for 80 years.

### Your Validation: Even Orthodox Bishops and Former ROCOR Members Agree

**When people tell you "You're being too strict for objecting to ROCOR's commemoration of Kirill,"** remember:

**Bishop Longin** - a widely respected Orthodox bishop - **ceased commemorating Kirill** for exactly the same reasons you're considering separation from ROCOR.

**ROCOR-A bishops and faithful** - who **maintained ROCOR's original principles** - **separated from current ROCOR** for exactly the same reasons.

**You're not more strict than Bishop Longin** - **you're following his canonical example**.

**You're not more strict than original ROCOR** - **you're following their 80-year witness**.

**You're not being "legalistic"** - **you're applying the same Orthodox canons** that ROCOR once applied.

### The Question That Destroys ROCOR's Position

**Here's the question that destroys ROCOR's current position**:

**If Bishop Longin is wrong** to cease commemorating Patriarch Kirill over ecumenical violations, **then ROCOR was wrong** to separate from Moscow for 80 years over the same theological principles.

**If Bishop Longin is right** to cease commemorating Patriarch Kirill, **then ROCOR is wrong** to maintain communion with Moscow despite ongoing ecumenical violations.

**There's no middle ground**. **Either the canonical principles matter or they don't**.

**Bishop Longin says they matter**. **ROCOR-A says they matter**. **Original ROCOR said they matter**.

**Current ROCOR says they don't** (through their actions, regardless of their words).

**Which Orthodox position will history vindicate?**

### How ROCOR Betrayed Their Own Faithful

**ROCOR spent 80 years** teaching their faithful that **ecumenical participation disqualifies hierarchs** from Orthodox communion. **Generations of ROCOR faithful** were raised believing that **separation from ecumenical compromise** was **essential Orthodox faithfulness**.

**Then in 2007**, ROCOR leadership **demanded that their faithful abandon** everything they had been taught. **Faithful ROCOR members** who **maintained ROCOR's original teachings** were suddenly treated as **troublemakers**.

**This is pastoral betrayal**: **Teaching people Orthodox principles for 80 years**, then **condemning them for following those principles**.

**Current ROCOR asks their faithful** to **violate the very canons** that **justified ROCOR's existence for 80 years**.

### Why the 2007 Reunion Creates Your Current Problem

**Here's the crucial issue**: While Moscow made concessions to ROCOR, **Moscow never fully abandoned ecumenical participation**. They remain in the **World Council of Churches** and continue **ecumenical dialogue**.

**ROCOR's reunion** was based on Moscow **"officially" rejecting the branch theory** while **continuing to practice ecumenical activities**. Some ROCOR bishops, clergy, and faithful **refused this compromise**, forming **ROCOR-A (Agafangel)** and other groups that **maintain the pre-2007 anti-ecumenical stance**.⁸¹

**This creates exactly the situation** sections 1-7 address: **Orthodox hierarchs who officially claim Orthodox positions** while **participating in activities** that **Orthodox tradition condemns**.

**The practical result**: **Attending ROCOR parishes now violates** the same canonical principles that **justified ROCOR's separation from Moscow for 80 years**. **You must choose**: Follow ROCOR's current institutional convenience, or follow ROCOR's proven 80-year canonical witness.

### The Contemporary Parallel: Ecumenical Compromise Mirrors Soviet Compromise

**Today's parallel is undeniable**: **When Orthodox hierarchs sign documents with the Pope of Rome** declaring **"we are no longer strangers"** and establishing **"united mission,"** they **compromise Orthodox spiritual freedom** just as Metropolitan Sergius did with Soviet demands. **The same canonical situation** requires **the same Orthodox response**.

**The vindication pattern confirms this**: **"Even now these faithful are being driven into the voluntary catacombs of separation from the ecumenist heresiarchs, gathering around the few truly Orthodox bishops who remain."**¹⁴³ **What began in Russia with political compromise** now manifests globally through **ecumenical compromise** - but **the Orthodox response remains canonical and necessary**.

**ROCOR once understood this perfectly**: They refused to maintain communion with hierarchs who had **compromised Orthodox tradition** for political convenience. **This is exactly what sections 1-9 demonstrate** Orthodox Christians should do when facing ecumenical compromise - including separating from current ROCOR.

### Patriarch Kirill's Personal Canonical Violations: The Exact Heresies ROCOR Now Commemorates

**As we established in Section 3**, Orthodox hierarchs have signed specific documents containing explicit heresies. **Patriarch Kirill** personally signed the most egregious example - the **2016 Havana Declaration** with Pope Francis. Here's what ROCOR now commemorates **by name** during every liturgy:

#### Kirill's "Brothers in Christian Faith" Declaration

**What Patriarch Kirill personally declared:**

> "It is with joy that we have met like brothers in the Christian faith"

**Why this violates Orthodox theology:** This implies **spiritual brotherhood with heretics**, contradicting Orthodox teaching that heretics are separated from the Body of Christ. **St. John Chrysostom** commanded: **"Be aware not to be corrupted from love of the heretics; for this reason do not accept any false belief in the name of love."** **St. Ignatius of Antioch** taught: **"It is fitting, therefore, that you should keep aloof from such persons."**

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 10** mandates **excommunication** for **"common prayer with heretics."**

#### Kirill's "Loss of Unity" Heresy - Denying Orthodox Ecclesiology

**What Patriarch Kirill personally signed in the Havana Declaration:**

> "We are pained by the loss of unity, the outcome of human weakness and of sin, which has occurred despite the priestly prayer of Christ the Saviour...Mindful of the permanence of many obstacles, it is our hope that our meeting may contribute to the re-establishment of this unity willed by God, for which Christ prayed."⁸⁵ᵉ

**Why this is heretical:** This **denies fundamental Orthodox ecclesiology** by claiming Orthodox-Catholic "unity" was "lost" and needs "re-establishment." **Orthodox teaching maintains that Christ's prayer for unity is always fulfilled in the Orthodox Church**. The "loss of unity" occurred when **Papists fell away from the ever-existing unity of the Orthodox Church** - not through mutual departure requiring "re-establishment."

**Orthodox Response:** As **Fr. Emmanuel Hatzidakis** explains in his Orthodox theological framework: **"The unity for which Christ prayed is always existent. It doesn't need to be re-established! The Papists fell away from the ever-existing saving unity of the Orthodox Church!"**¹⁶³

#### Kirill's "Common Mission" Partnership

**What Patriarch Kirill personally signed:**

> "Orthodox and Catholics are united not only by the shared Tradition of the Church of the first millennium, but also by the mission to preach the Gospel of Christ in the world today."⁸⁵ᵍ

**Why this violates Orthodox theology:** This implies **equal validity** of Orthodox and Catholic evangelization, suggesting both preach the true Gospel despite fundamental doctrinal differences. **St. Mark of Ephesus** declared: **"It is impossible to recall peace without dissolving the cause of the schism—the primacy of the Pope."** **St. John Chrysostom** taught that heretics **"have not the least participation in Christ, but vainly assume for themselves that saving name."**

**Orthodox Response:** **"Heretics have no blessing to preach the Gospel. They actually reject the true Gospel! Also Orthodox Christians have received a commandment from God to 'proselytize' (convert) heretics - including the Papists!"**⁸⁵ʰ

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 45** mandates **suspension or deposition** for **joint religious activities** with heretics.

#### Kirill's "We Are Not Competitors But Brothers" - Official Abandonment of Orthodox Mission

**What Patriarch Kirill personally agreed to:**

> "We are not competitors but brothers, and this concept must guide all our mutual actions as well as those directed to the outside world...Catholics and Orthodox are called to work together fraternally in proclaiming the Good News of salvation."⁸⁵ⁱ

**Why this violates Orthodox theology:** This **abandons the Orthodox missionary imperative** to bring those in error to Orthodox truth, treating heretics as **equal partners in salvation** rather than **souls needing conversion to Orthodoxy**. This directly contradicts **Orthodox eschatological responsibility** to **"proselytize" all non-Orthodox** to the True Faith.

**Orthodox Response:** As **Fr. Emmanuel Hatzidakis** devastatingly notes: **"The ultimate goal of the Joint Statement is the establishment of humanism, placing 'fraternal co-existence among the various populations, Churches and religions' as the ultimate goal. This sweeping statement alone should be sufficient for us to utterly reject the entire document."**¹⁶³

#### Kirill's "We Are Not Competitors But Brothers" Statement

**What Patriarch Kirill personally agreed to:**

> "We are not competitors but brothers, and this concept must guide all our mutual actions"

**Why this violates Orthodox theology:** This denies the **missionary imperative** to bring those in error to Orthodox truth, implying both churches possess equal validity. **St. Cyprian** declared: **"Does he who does not hold this unity of the Church think that he holds the faith?"**

**The canonical penalty:** Orthodox canons mandate separation from those who **fail to distinguish truth from heresy**.

#### Pope Francis's "Same Baptism" - Kirill's Agreement

**What Patriarch Kirill agreed to when Pope Francis declared:**

> "We speak as brothers, we have the same Baptism"

**Why this violates Orthodox theology:** This explicitly endorses **"baptismal theology,"** asserting sacramental validity outside Orthodoxy. **St. Athanasius** taught that heretical baptism is **"unprofitable"** and causes **"pollution rather than redemption."** The **Apostolic Constitutions** declare: **"There is no real baptism among heretics."**

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 46** mandates **deposition** for clergy **recognizing heretical baptism**.

#### Kirill's "No Proselytism" Heresy - Abandoning Orthodox Mission

**What Patriarch Kirill personally signed in Havana Declaration Paragraph 24:**

> "Orthodox and Catholics are united not only by the shared Tradition of the Church of the first millennium, but also by the mission to preach the Gospel of Christ in the world today. This mission entails mutual respect for members of the Christian communities and **excludes any form of proselytism**."⁸⁵ᵏ

**Why this violates Orthodox theology:** This **abandons the fundamental Orthodox missionary imperative** to convert all non-Orthodox to the True Faith. Orthodox Christianity has **always commanded "proselytism"** (conversion) of heretics as a **divine obligation**. By **"excluding proselytism,"** Kirill **officially abandons Orthodox eschatological responsibility**.

**Orthodox Response:** As noted in the Orthodox critique: **"Orthodox Christians have received a commandment from God to 'proselytize' (convert) heretics - including the Papists!"** **Elder Athanasios Mitilinaios** taught: **"Orthodoxy did not come to travel and journey along with the other religions or to coexist peacefully with them, and to learn to get along. It came to dissolve the false faiths once and for all."**⁸⁵ˡ

**The canonical penalty:** **Abandoning the Orthodox missionary mandate** constitutes **pastoral negligence** subject to **episcopal discipline** and **separation by the faithful**.

#### Kirill's "United Mission" with Heretics - Formal Ecclesiological Apostasy

**What Patriarch Kirill personally agreed to in Pope Francis' concluding remarks:**

> "We speak as brothers, we have the same Baptism, we are bishops. We speak of our Churches, and we agree that **unity is achieved by walking forward**."⁸⁵ᵐ

**Combined with Havana Declaration Paragraph 7:**

> "Orthodox and Catholics must learn to **give unanimously witness** in those spheres in which this is possible and necessary."⁸⁵ⁿ

**Why this violates Orthodox theology:** This **establishes formal "united mission" with heretics**, treating Catholic and Orthodox "Churches" as **equal witnesses to Gospel truth**. This **denies Orthodox exclusivity** and **validates heretical ecclesiology** through **official partnership in Gospel proclamation**.

**Orthodox Response:** **St. Mark of Ephesus** specifically condemned such arrangements: **"Let no one dominate in our faith: neither emperor, nor hierarch, nor false council, nor anyone else, but only the one God, Who both Himself and through His Disciples has handed it down to us."** **There can be no "united witness" with those who reject Orthodox truth**.

**The canonical penalty:** **"Joint religious activities" with heretics** fall under **Apostolic Canon 45** mandating **suspension or deposition**.

#### What This Means for ROCOR Parishes

**The uncomfortable canonical reality:** When your ROCOR priest commemorates **"Patriarch Kirill"** during liturgy, **he declares that Kirill "rightly teaches" Orthodox truth** - despite Kirill's **personal signature** on documents containing **explicit heresies** carrying **automatic canonical penalties**.

**As we established in sections 1-2:** Liturgical commemoration creates unavoidable spiritual unity. **Every ROCOR liturgy** now makes attendees **spiritually complicit** in Kirill's specific heretical declarations to Pope Francis.

**The 1983 ROCOR Anathema** specifically condemns **"those who knowingly have communion with these aforementioned heretics or who advocate, disseminate, or defend their new heresy of Ecumenism under the pretext of brotherly love...ANATHEMA!"** **Patriarch Kirill's Havana Declaration** falls **explicitly** under this anathema.

**ROCOR's canonical contradiction:** ROCOR **anathematized** the exact positions that **Patriarch Kirill personally signed** in 2016. **Current ROCOR commemorates** the very person their own 1983 Anathema condemns.

### Kirill's "Multi-Polar World" - Abandoning Orthodox Gospel for Secular Humanism

**Beyond ecumenical heresy**, Patriarch Kirill has **officially abandoned the Orthodox Gospel** itself for a **secular humanistic agenda**. His public statements reveal a **fundamental apostasy** from Orthodox Christian mission to secular "kingdom of man" building.

**Kirill's Official "Multi-Polar World" Agenda:**

> "In my view, the important task of interreligious dialogue and dialogue between bearers of secular humanistic and religious values is to assert the understanding of **the need to build a multi-polar world**...meaning a world in which different civilizational poles co-exist in harmony and maintain creative cooperation...It is necessary to find such a modus of interaction of civilizational models that will lead not to confrontation and opposition but to partnership and mutual enrichment — the necessary condition for **the prosperity of the whole humanity**."⁸⁵ᵖ

**Why this violates Orthodox Christianity:** This **abandons Christ's Kingdom** (which is **"not of this world"**) for secular **"prosperity of the whole humanity"** through **"civilizational cooperation."** Orthodox Christianity calls the world to **conversion to Christ**, not **"partnership" with secular humanistic values**.

**Metropolitan Hilarion's Supporting Apostasy:**

> "Without being one Church, could we not **act as one Church**? Could we not present ourselves to secular society as a **unified body**?...Both documents promote the priority of religious values over the interests of secular life. In opposing atheist humanism, they foster instead a **humanism guided by spiritual values**...an 'integral humanism capable of creating a new social, economic and political order, founded on the dignity and freedom of every human person.'"⁸⁵ᵠ

**Orthodox Response:** **Archimandrite Constantine Zaitsev** prophetically identified this apostasy: **"What then is the all-inclusive task for a 'sovietified Christian' consciousness? The setting up of a state of well being on earth, realized simultaneously by both the faithful and atheists. But this is precisely the contemporary task of the communists!"**⁸⁵ʳ

**Fr. Seraphim Rose** warned against this **"Religion of Humanity"**: **"This religion takes fundamental Christian values...and distorts them to be used toward the furtherance of purely earthly aims...It is, in fact, the profoundest and most ingenious substitute for Christianity ever devised [an anti-Christianity]."**⁸⁵ˢ

**The Ultimate Apostasy:** Kirill has transformed Orthodox Christianity from **"Come unto Christ"** to **"Let's build paradise on earth together."** This is **precisely the Antichrist's mission** - **earthly kingdom** rather than **heavenly salvation**.

### Your Choice: Follow ROCOR's Heroic Past or Compromised Present

**ROCOR's history** gives you **two models**:

**ROCOR 1927-2007**: **Applied Orthodox canons** strictly, **separated from heretical hierarchs**, **accepted 80 years of isolation** rather than compromise Orthodox integrity, **were eventually vindicated**.

**ROCOR 2007-present**: **Abandoned Orthodox canons** for institutional convenience, **maintain communion with heretical hierarchs**, **ignore their own theological positions** to avoid conflict, **demand compromise from their faithful**.

**Which ROCOR model** follows the pattern that **Orthodox history consistently vindicates**?

**Which ROCOR model** maintains **the canonical requirements** we established in sections 1-7?

**Which ROCOR model** follows **the heroic precedent** of Orthodox saints during iconoclasm that we documented in section 4?

**The choice is clear**: **Follow ROCOR's heroic past**, or **enable ROCOR's compromised present**.

### The Contemporary Vindication: Others Do What ROCOR Won't

**Bishop Longin** proves that **everything we've established in sections 1-10** represents **mainstream Orthodox canonical application**, not extremism.

**A Serbian Orthodox bishop** - with no connection to ROCOR's internal politics - **independently applied** the exact canonical principles that **ROCOR once championed**. He **ceased commemorating** a patriarch whose ecumenical activities violate Orthodox canons.

**ROCOR-A bishops and faithful** - who knew ROCOR's theology intimately - **separated from current ROCOR** using **ROCOR's own canonical principles**.

**This is exactly** what sections 1-7 showed Orthodox Christians should do when facing heretical hierarchy. **This is exactly** what section 4 showed Orthodox saints did during iconoclasm. **This is exactly** what section 12 showed ROCOR did for 80 years.

**Bishop Longin and ROCOR-A** didn't read our argument - **they applied Orthodox tradition**. The fact that they reached the same conclusion **validates everything we've demonstrated**.

### Your Historical Validation: You're Following ROCOR's Own Example

**As we established through sections 1-10**: When your bishop participates in ecumenism, and your priest commemorates that bishop, **you face the exact same canonical situation** that led ROCOR to 80 years of heroic separation.

**When you separate from current ROCOR** over their commemoration of ecumenical hierarchs, **you're following ROCOR's own 80-year example** - just applying it consistently.

**You're not rejecting ROCOR** - **you're preserving ROCOR's authentic witness** against the institutional compromise that has corrupted it.

**You're not being more strict than ROCOR** - **you're being as strict as ROCOR was** for 80 years before they abandoned their principles.

**History will vindicate your decision** just as it vindicated ROCOR's original separation - and just as it will vindicate Bishop Longin and ROCOR-A.

### The Ultimate Irony

**The ultimate irony**: **To remain faithful to ROCOR's principles**, **you must separate from ROCOR**.

**ROCOR taught you** that **separation from compromised hierarchy** preserves Orthodox faith. **Now you must apply that teaching** to **ROCOR itself**.

**This isn't betraying ROCOR** - **this is honoring what ROCOR used to represent** before institutional compromise corrupted their witness.

**You're not abandoning ROCOR's tradition** - **you're preserving it** against those who have abandoned it.

### Your Validation: Following ROCOR's Own Example Against Current ROCOR

**When people tell you "You're being too extreme for opposing ROCOR's commemoration of Kirill,"** remember:

**Bishop Longin** - a widely respected Orthodox bishop - **ceased commemorating Kirill** for exactly the same reasons you're considering separation from ROCOR.

**ROCOR-A bishops and faithful** - who **maintained ROCOR's original principles** - **separated from current ROCOR** for exactly the same reasons.

**You're not more strict than Bishop Longin** - **you're following his canonical example**.

**You're not more strict than original ROCOR** - **you're following their 80-year witness**.

**You're not being "legalistic"** - **you're applying the same Orthodox canons** that ROCOR once applied.

### Your Choice: Follow ROCOR's Proven Model or Enable Their Current Betrayal

**ROCOR's history** gives you **two models**:

**ROCOR 1927-2007**: **Applied Orthodox canons** strictly, **separated from heretical hierarchs**, **accepted 80 years of isolation** rather than compromise Orthodox integrity, **were eventually vindicated**.

**ROCOR 2007-present**: **Abandoned Orthodox canons** for institutional convenience, **maintain communion with heretical hierarchs**, **ignore their own theological positions** to avoid conflict, **demand compromise from their faithful**.

**Which ROCOR model** follows the pattern that **Orthodox history consistently vindicates**?

**Which ROCOR model** maintains **the canonical requirements** we established in sections 1-7?

**The choice is clear**: **Follow ROCOR's heroic past**, or **enable ROCOR's compromised present**.

**Your decision to separate** from liturgy where ecumenical bishops are commemorated **follows ROCOR's proven successful model** - **you're being more faithful to ROCOR's tradition than current ROCOR leadership**.
