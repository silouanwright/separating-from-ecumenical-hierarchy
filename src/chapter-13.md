## Chapter 13: "The Church Uses Economia" - Father Michael's Threats
- **Maria's Encounter**: Father Michael learns she's been "spreading dissent"
- People have been asking her for explanations, she's simply sharing her canonical position
- His accusations: "causing scandal," "disturbing parish peace," "making it impossible to help you"
- Economia manipulation: Using pastoral flexibility to justify ignoring canonical violations
- **Maria's Response**: Economia cannot override fundamental doctrine, proper vs. improper applications
- The threat: "If you continue disturbing the peace..."
