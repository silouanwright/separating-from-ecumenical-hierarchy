## Chapter 13: "The Church Uses Economia"

### What Clergy Don't Want You to Discover About Economia's True Limits

When clergy invoke "economia" to justify attendance at liturgies commemorating ecumenical bishops, they're banking on your ignorance of Orthodox theology. The patristic sources reveal something they desperately hope you'll never investigate: economia has strict canonical boundaries that make their demands not just wrong, but violations of fundamental Orthodox law.

**St. Theodore the Studite, the great defender of icons and canonical precision, established the foundational principle that destroys all misuse of economia. He taught that "whatever is done economically for a certain time has nothing blameworthy... but it is nonetheless somewhat relaxed and not entirely exact." However, he immediately added the crucial limitation that exposes contemporary manipulation: "This is economia—that which is for a time. For if someone acted economically permanently, instead of economia he would be committing transgression."¹**

This teaching appears consistently throughout Orthodox tradition, but clergy invoking economia to justify permanent communion with ecumenical bishops have violated Theodore's fundamental principle. True economia provides temporary pastoral flexibility within Orthodox boundaries—it never grants permanent authorization to violate canonical requirements.

### The Contemporary Orthodox Consensus That Destroys Economia Abuse

**Fr. Theodore Zisis, Professor Emeritus of Patristics at the University of Thessaloniki, addressed this exact manipulation when his own metropolitan attempted to use economia to silence canonical concerns. Fr. Zisis wrote with devastating clarity: "Economia cannot destroy the akriveia: it is only temporary in character. For the bishop's name to be commemorated it is necessary that he teaches Orthodox things, that he rightly divides the word of truth. When he preaches heresy, we sever all relations and communion with him."²**

**Fr. Zisis demolished the economia defense with surgical precision: "We do not reproach those bishops who are clearly Orthodox in their mindset... However, we beseech them to consider the proliferation and prominence of Ecumenism... Economia cannot destroy the akriveia."³** When a professor of patristics with decades of scholarly authority declares that economia cannot excuse heretical commemoration, clergy have no theological ground left to stand on.

But the Orthodox consensus extends far beyond contemporary scholarship. **St. Basil the Great, whose canonical letters form the backbone of Orthodox ecclesiastical law, distinguished carefully between matters where economia could apply and fundamental issues where it could not.⁴ St. John Chrysostom taught that pastoral flexibility must never compromise fundamental truth, emphasizing that shepherds who mislead the flock through false compassion are more dangerous than open persecutors.⁵**

**The early ecumenical councils used economia with surgical precision—for receiving repentant heretics or addressing administrative irregularities—but never to excuse participation in heretical worship or communion with heretics.⁶ This patristic fortress makes clear that economia has always concerned mercy in application, never compromise in doctrine.**

### The Canonical Framework That Makes Economia Irrelevant

Here's what they really don't want you to discover: the situation doesn't fall under economia's scope at all. **The Orthodox canons explicitly prohibit joining in prayer with heretics through Apostolic Canons 45 and 46, which establish clear prohibitions: "Let any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended" and "We ordain that a bishop or presbyter who has admitted heretics' baptism or sacrifice be deposed."⁷**

When bishops commemorate ecumenical patriarchs who pray with the Pope, they violate these explicit canonical laws. Economia cannot be invoked to justify canonical violations because that represents a fundamental theological contradiction—using Orthodox pastoral flexibility to violate Orthodox canonical law.

**Canon 15 of the First-Second Council specifically addresses situations involving heretical bishops, explicitly protecting those who separate from bishops "preaching the heresy publicly, and teaching it bareheaded in church."⁸ This canon doesn't mention economia because this situation requires strict application of Orthodox law, not pastoral flexibility.**

**The Mt. Athos fathers captured this principle perfectly in their letter to Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos: "If simply greeting heretics makes us communicants in heresy, how much more is this the case with the vocal official commemoration of one during the celebration of the divine and dread mysteries?"⁹** The monastic consensus established that heretical commemoration falls outside economia's scope entirely—it requires fundamental canonical obedience.

### The Overwhelming Historical Precedent Against Economia Abuse

**Orthodox history demonstrates that saints consistently rejected economia when it meant compromising with heretics. St. Athanasius the Great never used economia to excuse communion with Arian bishops, even under massive imperial pressure.¹⁰ St. Maximus the Confessor refused to accept economia as justification for Monothelite compromise, suffering torture and death rather than accept heretical accommodation.¹¹ St. Mark of Ephesus explicitly rejected using economia to justify the Union of Florence, choosing exile over compromise.¹²**

**The Kollyvades fathers refused to accept economia as justification for liturgical innovations, understanding that pastoral flexibility cannot override Orthodox principles.¹³ Throughout 1700 years of Orthodox history, the saints consistently taught that economia cannot override fundamental Orthodox commitments.**

This historical fortress reveals a devastating pattern: every attempt to use economia to justify compromise with heretics has been rejected by Orthodox saints and later vindicated by the Church. Contemporary clergy invoking economia to silence canonical concerns place themselves in direct opposition to unanimous patristic consensus.

### The Burden-Flipping Reality That Exposes Clerical Manipulation

Here's the question that destroys all economia arguments: who's really violating Orthodox tradition? **Those who refuse to participate in prayers with heretics, exactly as the Apostolic Canons require? Or those who use economia to justify what the canons explicitly forbid?**

**Fr. Zisis expressed this devastating logic with unassailable clarity: "We must not speak lies before the Holy Table... How can the Orthodox soul tolerate these things? How can he not sever communion with those who do commemorate him?"¹⁴** When clergy ask you to attend liturgies where heretical bishops are commemorated, they're demanding that you violate your Orthodox conscience and canonical commitments.

The burden of proof belongs entirely on those demanding canonical violations, not on those maintaining Orthodox law. **Orthodox chrismation involves explicit commitment to the Orthodox faith as defined by the canons and councils. The Apostolic Canons explicitly forbid prayer with heretics.¹⁵ When bishops commemorate those who pray with the Pope, they request participation in violations of fundamental chrismation promises.**

Economia cannot justify breaking fundamental Orthodox commitments because that creates a theological impossibility—using Orthodox tradition to violate Orthodox tradition.

### Understanding Clerical Threats: True Pastoral Care vs. Institutional Control

**When clergy threaten ecclesiastical punishment for canonical obedience, they engage in institutional manipulation, not pastoral care. This represents exactly the episcopal abuse that Orthodox canons were designed to protect against.**

**The Orthodox tradition teaches that true pastoral care sometimes requires protecting the flock from spiritual danger, even when institutional pressure demands compromise.¹⁶ St. John Chrysostom wrote with prophetic insight: "It is better to protect the sheep from wolves than to worry about the wolves' feelings."¹⁷**

When bishops embrace ecumenism, they become spiritual wolves regardless of their intentions or institutional positions. True economia protects the faithful from such dangers—it never exposes them to additional spiritual contamination for the sake of institutional harmony.

**Canon 15 explicitly protects those who separate from heretical bishops, declaring that they "not only are not subject to any canonical penalty... but, on the contrary, they shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians."¹⁸** You have stronger canonical protection than those threatening you.

### The Economic Reality: How Orthodox Resistance Forces Reform

**Orthodox history demonstrates that bishops notice immediately when collection plates empty and pews remain vacant.¹⁹ The faithful withdrawing from compromised liturgies has proven more effective at forcing Orthodox reform than theological arguments that bishops can ignore.**

This represents your power as Orthodox laypeople: you control the resources that make parish life possible. When you understand your canonical rights and exercise them, bishops must address concerns they would otherwise dismiss through economia manipulation.

**If faithful families in your parish understand the canonical issues involved, that economic pressure might help your priest address these concerns seriously rather than dismissing them through false pastoral flexibility.**

### Historical Precedent: How Orthodox Resistance Preserves the Church

**Orthodox history reveals that faithful resistance to heretical hierarchy actually strengthens the Church across generations. When the faithful refused communion with Arian bishops, they preserved Orthodoxy for future generations.²⁰ When laypeople resisted the Union of Brest, they kept Orthodoxy alive in Eastern Europe.²¹ When parishes rejected the calendar changes of 1924, they forced the Church to address liturgical issues properly.²²**

**Fr. Zisis understood this principle with remarkable clarity: "If you start the casting out [of those who cease commemoration], you will be a transgressor of the Holy Canons and the author of a schismatic situation. I am not provoking schism... I remain with the high hopes of resuming your commemoration when you publicly... condemn the heresies."²³**

True economia would protect your canonical right to separate from heretical commemoration, not threaten you for exercising Orthodox law. The pattern throughout Church history demonstrates that faithful Orthodox resistance to compromise preserves authentic tradition while accommodation leads to further theological corruption.

### The Practical Path Forward: Canonical Protection and Orthodox Hope

**When clergy misuse economia to pressure canonical violations, you need clear understanding of your Orthodox rights and responsibilities. Canon 15 explicitly protects those who separate from heretical bishops—you're exercising Orthodox law, not rebelling against it.²⁴**

Your attendance and financial support make parish life possible, creating economic leverage that bishops cannot ignore. **When you understand that attending liturgies commemorating ecumenical bishops violates specific Orthodox canons with penalties of suspension and deposition, your separation becomes not just permitted but required.²⁵**

**Find Orthodox communities that maintain strict canonical positions without compromising with ecumenical bishops. Your separation isn't permanent abandonment but temporary protection while maintaining hope for Orthodox reform.**

The Orthodox tradition is unambiguous: economia provides temporary pastoral flexibility in appropriate situations, but it can never justify fundamental violations of Orthodox faith and canonical law. **When bishops publicly embrace heresy through ecumenical commemoration, faithful Orthodox Christians have both the canonical right and spiritual duty to separate from their communion—not as rebellion against Orthodox tradition, but as faithfulness to the Orthodox Church that saints died to preserve.**

You're following 1700 years of Orthodox precedent established by saints who chose canonical obedience over institutional convenience. Trust the tradition, exercise your canonical rights, and maintain hope that faithful resistance will help restore Orthodox integrity to compromised hierarchy.
