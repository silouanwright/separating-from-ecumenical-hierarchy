## Chapter 13: "The Church Uses Economia" - Father Michael's Threats

The phone call came on a Tuesday evening, just as Maria was helping her daughter with homework.

"Maria, this is Father Michael," the voice was stern, formal—not the warm pastoral tone she'd grown accustomed to over the years. "I need to see you in my office tomorrow after vespers. We need to discuss your... activities."

Maria's heart sank. She'd been dreading this conversation, but she'd known it was inevitable. Word had gotten around that she'd been sharing her research with other parishioners who'd asked questions about her absence from liturgy.

"Of course, Father," she replied quietly. "I'll be there."

### The Confrontation: Economia as Weaponized Pastoral Concern

The next evening, Maria found herself sitting across from Father Michael in his cluttered office, icons watching from every wall. His expression was grave.

"Maria, I'm very disappointed," he began, leaning back in his chair. "Mrs. Papadopoulos tells me you've been spreading dissent in the parish. People have been coming to me with questions—disturbing questions—about commemorating our bishop."

Maria took a deep breath. "Father, people asked me directly why I haven't been at liturgy. I simply shared what I've learned about the canonical position on commemoration."

"That's exactly the problem," Father Michael's voice rose slightly. "You're causing scandal, disturbing the peace of the parish. Some families are actually considering staying home from church because of what you've told them. You're making it impossible for me to help you through this difficult period."

### The Economia Manipulation: Pastoral Flexibility to Justify Canonical Violations

Father Michael leaned forward, his tone becoming more conciliatory. "Maria, I understand you're struggling with some theological questions. That's normal—many thoughtful Orthodox go through periods of doubt. But the Church uses economia. We have pastoral flexibility to help people through these times without requiring perfect theological understanding."

"You don't need to understand every detail about ecumenical dialogue or inter-church relations," he continued. "The Church has wise bishops who handle these complex matters. Your job is to attend liturgy, pray, and trust that God is working through the hierarchy. Economia allows us to overlook minor concerns for the sake of your spiritual well-being."

Maria felt a chill. She recognized the subtle manipulation—using the concept of economia to silence legitimate canonical concerns.

"Father," she said carefully, "I appreciate your pastoral concern. But I've been studying what Orthodox theology actually teaches about economia, and I don't think it applies to this situation."

### The Orthodox Teaching on Economia: Temporary Exceptions, Not Doctrinal Compromises

Maria pulled out her notes. "**St. Theodore the Studite taught that economia can only be temporary in character and cannot destroy akriveia (strictness). He wrote: 'Whatever is done economically for a certain time has nothing blameworthy... but it is nonetheless somewhat relaxed and not entirely exact.'**¹

"**But he was very clear that economia has limits: 'This is economia—that which is for a time. For if someone acted economically permanently, instead of economia he would be committing transgression.'**² **Economia cannot permanently override canonical requirements or fundamental doctrine.**"

Father Michael frowned. "Maria, you're getting into theological complexities that are beyond your understanding. Trust the Church's wisdom."

"But Father, **Fr. Theodore Zisis explains this clearly in his letter to his metropolitan. He writes: 'Economia cannot destroy the akriveia: it is only temporary in character.'**³ **The Orthodox position is that economia might temporarily allow flexibility in disciplinary matters, but it cannot override fundamental doctrinal positions or canonical prohibitions.**"

### The Medical Prescription Analogy: When Doctors Ignore Medical Standards

Maria could see Father Michael was becoming uncomfortable, so she tried an analogy.

"Father, imagine if you went to a doctor who said, 'I know the medical textbooks say this treatment is dangerous, but I'm using medical flexibility to prescribe it anyway.' Would you trust that doctor?"

"That's not the same thing, Maria," Father Michael replied.

"**Actually, it's exactly the same thing. The Orthodox canons explicitly prohibit joining in prayer with heretics—Apostolic Canons 45 and 46 are very specific about this.**⁴ **When bishops commemorate ecumenical patriarchs who pray with the Pope, they're violating explicit canonical law. Economia cannot be used to justify canonical violations.**"

### The Patristic Teaching: Economia's Proper Scope and Limits

Maria continued building her theological case. "**The Church Fathers were very careful about economia's proper application. St. Basil the Great distinguished between matters where economia could apply and fundamental issues where it could not.**⁵

"**St. John Chrysostom taught that pastoral flexibility must never compromise fundamental truth. In his homilies, he emphasized that shepherds who mislead the flock through false compassion are more dangerous than open persecutors.**⁶

"**The early ecumenical councils used economia carefully—for receiving repentant heretics or addressing administrative irregularities—but never to excuse participation in heretical worship or communion with heretics.**⁷ **Economia has always been about mercy in application, not compromise in doctrine.**"

### The Canonical Framework: Why This Situation Falls Outside Economia's Scope

Father Michael was listening with growing discomfort. Maria pressed her theological advantage.

"**Father, Canon 15 of the First-Second Council specifically addresses this situation. It explicitly protects those who separate from bishops 'preaching the heresy publicly, and teaching it bareheaded in church.'**⁸ **This canon doesn't mention economia because this situation requires strict application of Orthodox law.**

"**Apostolic Canon 31 reinforces this: those who separate from heretical bishops 'not only are not subject to the above penances, but have a right to claim the honor due to Orthodox Christians.'**⁹ **These canons establish strict requirements precisely because communion with heretics is so spiritually dangerous.**

"**The Mt. Athos fathers explained this perfectly in their letter to Emperor Michael VIII: 'If simply greeting heretics makes us communicants in heresy, how much more is this the case with the vocal official commemoration of one during the celebration of the divine and dread mysteries?'**¹⁰ **This isn't a matter where economia can apply—it's a matter of fundamental canonical obedience.**"

### Contemporary Orthodox Authority: Fr. Zisis on Economia's Misuse

Maria found her key contemporary source. "**Fr. Theodore Zisis, Professor Emeritus of Patristics, addressed this exact argument when his metropolitan tried to use economia to justify ecumenical activities.**¹¹

"**Fr. Zisis wrote: 'Economia cannot destroy the akriveia: it is only temporary in character. For the bishop's name to be commemorated it is necessary that he teaches Orthodox things, that he rightly divides the word of truth. When he preaches heresy, we sever all relations and communion with him.'**¹²

"**He specifically rejected using economia to excuse heretical commemoration: 'We do not reproach those bishops who are clearly Orthodox in their mindset... However, we beseech them to consider the proliferation and prominence of Ecumenism... Economia cannot destroy the akriveia.'**¹³"

### The Business Contract Analogy: When Legal Flexibility Cannot Apply

Father Michael was growing visibly agitated. Maria tried another practical approach.

"Father, imagine if you signed a contract saying you wouldn't do business with your client's competitors. Later, your client started partnering with those same competitors and asked you to 'be flexible' about the contract terms. Could you claim 'business economia' to justify breaking your explicit contractual obligations?"

"That's a completely different situation," Father Michael protested.

"**Actually, it's exactly parallel. When I was chrismated, I committed to the Orthodox faith as defined by the canons and councils.**¹⁴ **The Apostolic Canons explicitly forbid prayer with heretics. When bishops commemorate those who pray with the Pope, they're asking me to violate my chrismation promises.**¹⁵ **Economia cannot be used to justify breaking fundamental Orthodox commitments.**"

### The Food Safety Analogy: When Safety Standards Cannot Be "Flexibly" Applied

Maria tried one more analogy she hoped would resonate.

"Father, if a restaurant health inspector found contaminated food, could the chef claim 'culinary economia' to continue serving it? Could he say, 'We're being flexible about food safety for the sake of customer satisfaction'?"

"Of course not," Father Michael replied. "Food safety isn't negotiable."

"**Exactly. And the Church Fathers taught that spiritual safety isn't negotiable either. St. Theodore the Studite wrote: 'Communion with heretics is poison that blackens and darkens the soul.'**¹⁶ **St. Symeon of Thessalonica explained that commemorating heretics literally contaminates the Eucharist.**¹⁷ **You can't use economia to justify spiritual contamination any more than you can use culinary flexibility to justify food poisoning.**"

### The Authority Accumulation: Overwhelming Orthodox Consensus on Economia's Limits

Maria continued with her comprehensive theological case. "**This isn't just one or two Church Fathers. The Orthodox consensus on economia's limits is overwhelming.**

"**St. Athanasius never used economia to excuse communion with Arian bishops, even under imperial pressure.**¹⁸ **St. Maximus the Confessor refused to accept economia as justification for Monothelite compromise.**¹⁹ **St. Mark of Ephesus explicitly rejected using economia to justify the Union of Florence.**²⁰

"**The Kollyvades fathers refused to accept economia as justification for liturgical innovations.**²¹ **Throughout Orthodox history, the saints consistently taught that economia cannot override fundamental Orthodox principles.**"

### The Pharmaceutical Analogy: When Medical Exceptions Have Strict Boundaries

Father Michael was struggling to respond, so Maria offered another practical comparison.

"Father, doctors sometimes prescribe medications 'off-label'—using approved drugs for conditions they weren't specifically tested for. That's medical economia. But could a doctor use 'medical economia' to prescribe chemotherapy for a headache?"

"Obviously not," Father Michael said reluctantly.

"**That's exactly how Orthodox economia works. It can provide flexibility in disciplinary matters or administrative situations, but it cannot be used to prescribe spiritual poison.**²² **When bishops commemorate those who pray with heretics, they're asking us to take spiritual chemotherapy for a non-existent disease.**

"**The Orthodox tradition is clear: economia has strict boundaries, and protecting the faithful from spiritual contamination is one of those boundaries.**"

### The Burden-Flipping Question: Who's Really Violating Orthodox Tradition?

As the conversation continued, Maria decided to address the underlying issue directly.

"Father, with respect, I need to ask: **who's really violating Orthodox tradition here? Those who refuse to participate in prayers with heretics, as the Apostolic Canons require? Or those who use economia to justify what the canons explicitly forbid?**

"**Fr. Zisis put it perfectly: 'We must not speak lies before the Holy Table... How can the Orthodox soul tolerate these things? How can he not sever communion with those who do commemorate him?'**²³ **When you ask me to attend liturgies where heretical bishops are commemorated, you're asking me to violate my Orthodox conscience.**"

### The Threat and the Response: True Pastoral Care vs. Institutional Manipulation

Father Michael's demeanor shifted. His pastoral mask slipped, revealing institutional frustration.

"Maria, if you continue disturbing the peace of this parish, if you keep spreading these divisive ideas, I'll have no choice but to recommend that the bishop take action. You could be banned from communion. Your daughter's Orthodox education could be affected. Think carefully about the consequences of your actions."

Maria felt the fear he intended, but she also recognized the manipulation. This wasn't pastoral care—it was institutional bullying designed to silence legitimate Orthodox concerns.

"Father," she said quietly, "**I understand you're in a difficult position. But the Orthodox tradition teaches that true pastoral care sometimes requires protecting the flock from spiritual danger, even when that's uncomfortable.**²⁴

"**St. John Chrysostom wrote: 'It is better to protect the sheep from wolves than to worry about the wolves' feelings.'**²⁵ **When bishops embrace ecumenism, they become spiritual wolves, regardless of their intentions. True economia protects the faithful from such dangers—it doesn't expose them to more danger.**"

### The Historical Precedent: How Orthodox Resistance Actually Helps the Church

Maria offered her final theological point. "Father, **Orthodox history shows that faithful resistance to heretical hierarchy actually helps the Church. When the faithful refused communion with Arian bishops, they preserved Orthodoxy for future generations.**²⁶

"**When laypeople resisted the Union of Brest, they kept Orthodoxy alive in Eastern Europe.**²⁷ **When parishes rejected the calendar changes of 1924, they forced the Church to address the issue properly.**²⁸

"**Fr. Zisis understood this: 'If you start the casting out [of those who cease commemoration], you will be a transgressor of the Holy Canons and the author of a schismatic situation. I am not provoking schism... I remain with the high hopes of resuming your commemoration when you publicly... condemn the heresies.'**²⁹

"**True economia would protect my canonical right to separate from heretical commemoration, not threaten me for exercising it.**"

### The Leverage Reality: When Institutional Threats Meet Canonical Protection

Father Michael was clearly frustrated by Maria's theological preparation. "Maria, you're being stubborn and prideful. The Church has mechanisms for addressing theological concerns. You should trust the process."

"Father," Maria replied gently but firmly, "**the Church also has mechanisms for protecting the faithful when those processes fail. Canon 15 exists precisely for situations like this.**³⁰

"**I'm not being stubborn—I'm being canonically obedient. The Orthodox position is clear: when bishops publicly embrace heresy, the faithful have both the right and duty to separate from their communion. That's not my opinion—that's Orthodox law.**

"**And Father, you should know that threats of ecclesiastical punishment for canonical obedience actually violate Orthodox procedure. Fr. Zisis was excommunicated for the same canonical action I'm taking, but Canon 15 explicitly protects such decisions.**³¹"

### The Economic Reality: When Empty Pews Speak Louder Than Seminary Arguments

As their meeting was concluding, Maria offered one final practical observation.

"Father, I know you're concerned about parish unity and attendance. But **Orthodox history shows that bishops notice immediately when collection plates empty and pews remain vacant.**³² **The faithful withdrawing from compromised liturgies has always been more effective at forcing Orthodox reform than theological arguments that bishops can ignore.**

"**If several families in the parish understand the canonical issues involved, that might actually help you make the case to the bishop that these concerns need to be addressed seriously rather than dismissed through economia.**

"**True pastoral care would support the canonical rights of Orthodox faithful, not threaten them for exercising those rights.**"

### The Final Exchange: Orthodox Charity vs. Institutional Pressure

Father Michael stood up, signaling the end of their meeting. "Maria, I'll be praying for you. I hope you'll reconsider your position before this goes any further."

"Thank you, Father," Maria replied sincerely. "I'll be praying for you too—that God gives you wisdom in this difficult situation. **I know you became a priest to serve Orthodox truth, not to manage institutional compromise.**

"**If you ever want to discuss the actual Orthodox teaching on economia versus the political pressure to misuse it, I'd be honored to share what I've learned. The Church Fathers have tremendous wisdom on protecting both pastoral care and Orthodox integrity.**"

As Maria left the rectory that evening, she felt both sadness and relief. Sadness for Father Michael, caught between his Orthodox training and institutional pressure. Relief that she'd been able to articulate the authentic Orthodox position clearly and charitably.

**The Orthodox tradition was clear: economia could provide temporary pastoral flexibility in appropriate situations, but it could never be used to justify fundamental violations of Orthodox faith and canonical law. When bishops publicly embraced heresy, faithful Orthodox Christians had both the canonical right and spiritual duty to separate from their communion—not as an act of rebellion, but as an act of faithfulness to the Orthodox Church the saints had died to preserve.**
