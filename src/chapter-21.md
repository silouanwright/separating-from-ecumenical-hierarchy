## Chapter 21: The Homily Attack - Public Destruction

**The Full Scene**:

*Six weeks after I stopped attending, my friend Sarah called me, clearly uncomfortable. "Maria, I need to tell you something that happened at Divine Liturgy yesterday. I don't know if I should, but... I think you need to know."*

*She described how Father Michael had deviated from his usual homily. Instead of preaching on the Gospel reading, he had positioned himself at the center of the ambo, his voice carrying that particular tone I knew meant this particular homily would be intense.*

*He began...*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.*

*The congregation said "Amen".*

*He paused for a while... talked a little about the Gospel reading and its relevance... and then said this:*

*"....there's a certain individual who used to attend parish," he had announced, his eyes scanning the congregation, "whom many of you know, who unfortunately, thinks they know better than the Church. They've decided that their private interpretation of some obscure canons and out of context citations from the saints, makes them holier than the rest of you."*

*Sarah said the church had gone completely silent. Everyone knew exactly who he meant.*

*"The Gospel reading today, focuses on the Pharisees that Christ condemned. They were so 'correct' that they forgot what it means to be humble... So obsessed with finding fault in others that they can't see the beam in her own eye."*

*The words hit Maria like physical blows, even hearing them secondhand. This was her priest - the man she had trusted with her spiritual formation, who had heard her children's confessions and her own, who had blessed her home.*

*Sarah's voice was barely a whisper as she continued: "He said... that some people become so 'puffed up' with their own knowledge that they lose all Christian love. That they choose theological pride over obedience to the Church. That they become a scandal to simple believers."*

*...tears streamed down Maria's face.*

*But then - Father Michael's voice suddenly became warm and pastoral again. Sarah said he looked out over the congregation with that gentle smile Maria remembered so well and said: "But we, my beloved parishioners, must respond with love. The saints teach us to love even those who persecute us, who cause division among us. We must pray for these people and their families, that God might soften her hardened hearts and restore to them the humility of the Gospel. Amen."*

*Maria asked if anyone said anything to the priest... but she already understood that for many, they agreed with what the priest said about her. For the few that didn't, their stance was that this is the closest Orthodox parish for miles, they live in this area, and so there's no need to rock the boat. "As long as we can confess and commune, let us practice silence, as the saints teach"....*

*Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. (1 Corinthians 11:27)*

*What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? ...When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean...seek justice, correct oppression, bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause. (Isaiah 1:11-17)*

*Maria thanked Sarah, and got off the phone.*

*She felt humiliated, scared, betrayed, and unloved. She felt alone.*

**Analysis**: Public spiritual assassination using the ambo, weaponizing Scripture against Orthodox tradition, community complicity through silence, divine judgment on those who enable spiritual abuse
