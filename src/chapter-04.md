## Chapter 4: How Orthodox Christians Responded During Iconoclasm

As Maria learned about the iconoclastic crisis, one question kept returning to her mind: **"How exactly did Orthodox Christians respond when their own bishops and patriarchs embraced heresy?"**

The answer would prove crucial for understanding how Orthodox tradition handles the exact situation she was facing.

### The Canonical Foundation: Orthodox Authority to Separate

**Before examining specific responses**, Maria discovered the **canonical foundation** that guided Orthodox resistance. The Church's vindication of iconoclastic-era separations provides **the clearest possible Orthodox teaching** on separation from heretical hierarchy.

**Canon 15 of the First-Second Council (861 AD)** gave Orthodox Christians **explicit canonical permission**¹,² to separate from heretical bishops:

> **"Those who separate from their bishop before a synodical investigation because he himself is preaching some misbelief and heresy publicly, and who openly teach it bareheaded in church... not only are not subject to the above penances, but have a right to claim the honor due to Orthodox Christians. For they have defied, not Bishops, but pseudo-bishops and pseudo-teachers."**³

**This canon established the revolutionary principle:** Orthodox Christians have **canonical authority to cease communion with heretical bishops even "before synodical investigation"** - they don't need to wait for official condemnation.

Maria sat back, stunned. **"Wait a minute,"** she thought to herself. **"The Orthodox Church itself actually gives laypeople permission to separate from bishops who preach heresy publicly? Canon 15 says we should be 'deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits Orthodox Christians' for doing this? I had no idea this even existed."**

#### The Patristic Foundation: Orthodox Resistance Is Not Optional

**As Maria continued researching, she discovered that resistance to heretical bishops wasn't just permitted - it was commanded by the greatest saints of the Church.**

**St. John Chrysostom**, the golden-mouthed preacher whose liturgy Orthodox Christians celebrate, taught with devastating clarity:

> **"What then, you say, when he is wicked should we obey? Wicked? In what sense? If indeed in regard to Faith, flee and avoid him; not only if he be a man, but even if he be an angel come down from Heaven."**⁴ᵃ

**Think about this**: St. John Chrysostom commands Orthodox Christians to **"flee and avoid"** bishops who are wicked "in regard to Faith" - even if they claim angelic authority! This isn't a suggestion but a command from one of the Three Holy Hierarchs.

**Metropolitan Augustine Kantiotis**, one of the 20th century's most respected Orthodox hierarchs, explained the theological foundation:

> **"The bishop must obey the Gospel. This is why when the Bishop is ordained, he is ordained under the Gospel. As the Fathers say, this means that the people shall obey the Bishop on one condition – that the Bishop obey the Gospel. But when the Bishop does not obey the Gospel and does not do according to the Holy Canons, then the clergy and the people are not obliged to obey the Bishop."**⁴ᵇ

**This establishes the principle of conditional obedience**: Episcopal authority depends on Orthodox faithfulness. When bishops abandon Orthodox truth, their authority ceases.

#### The Theological Principle: Diakrisis vs. Blind Submission

**Elder Athanasios Mitilinaios**, one of Greece's most respected contemporary theologians, taught the crucial distinction between Orthodox obedience and blind submission:

> **"if at some point priests, bishops or patriarchs maneuver in a heretical manner, the people of God can and must reprove them."**⁴ᶜ

**This principle is called "diakrisis" (discernment)** - the Orthodox spiritual gift of distinguishing truth from error, even when error comes from hierarchical authority. **Blind obedience to heretical bishops is not Orthodox** - it's spiritual suicide.

#### The Apostolic Warning: Even Angels Must Be Resisted

**St. Maximus the Confessor**, the great defender of Orthodox Christology, provided the theological foundation that even apostolic or angelic authority cannot override Orthodox truth:

> **"The Holy Spirit, through the apostle, condemns even angels who innovate in some way contrary to what is preached."**⁴ᵈ

**This references Galatians 1:8** where St. Paul declares: **"But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed."** Orthodox tradition applies this directly to heretical bishops - their hierarchical rank provides no protection when they preach heresy.

#### Historical Vindication: The Arian Crisis Proves Lay Authority

**The most powerful historical precedent comes from the Arian crisis**, when the majority of bishops embraced heresy while the laypeople preserved Orthodox truth. **Cardinal Newman**, studying this period before his conversion to Catholicism, made a shocking discovery:

> **"the Catholic people, in the length and breadth of Christendom, were the obstinate champions of Catholic truth, and the bishops were not."**⁴ᵉ

**Think about this**: During the worst doctrinal crisis in Church history, **the laypeople were right and the bishops were wrong**. This historical fact demolishes any claim that laypeople must blindly follow episcopal authority.

**St. Athanasius the Great**, who stood virtually alone among the bishops, was supported primarily by:
- **The monks of the Egyptian desert** who refused communion with Arian bishops
- **Orthodox laypeople** who organized separate liturgies in cemeteries rather than attend Arian churches
- **Faithful communities** who physically prevented Arian bishops from entering their churches

**The sensus fidelium (sense of the faithful)** preserved Orthodox truth when the majority of the hierarchy failed. This principle - that the Holy Spirit guides the whole Church, not just bishops - provides theological foundation for lay resistance to heretical hierarchy.

### St. Theodore the Studite: The Master of Orthodox Resistance

Maria discovered that **St. Theodore the Studite** wasn't just making abstract theological statements - he was **the primary architect of Orthodox resistance**⁴,⁵,⁶ who provided detailed practical guidance for Orthodox Christians facing exactly her situation.

#### Complete Liturgical Separation: No Exceptions

**St. Theodore applied his systematic "Three-Tier Principle"** (which we established in Chapter 2) to the iconoclastic crisis, requiring **absolute liturgical separation**⁷,⁸ from:

1. **Direct heretics** (iconoclastic bishops)
2. **Commemorators** (orthodox priests who commemorated heretical bishops)
3. **Participants** (those receiving communion from commemorating priests)

**As we learned in Chapter 2, Theodore taught that all three categories become spiritually contaminated through the liturgical structure itself.** Theodore grounded this principle in **St. John Chrysostom's teaching**: **"the Divine Chrysostom has declared loudly and clearly that not only heretics, but also those who commune with such people, are enemies of God."**⁹

**St. John Chrysostom confirms St. Theodore's Three-Tier Principle** - this isn't just one saint's interpretation, but the consistent Orthodox teaching across centuries.

**The patristic foundation extends even deeper.** **St. Basil the Great** had already established this exact principle centuries earlier:

> **"As for all those who pretend to confess sound Orthodox Faith, but are in communion with people who hold a different opinion, if they are forewarned and still remain stubborn, you must not only not be in communion with them, but you must not even call them brothers."**⁸⁹

**Theodore applied St. Basil's principle systematically**: Even **"those who pretend to confess sound Orthodox Faith"** (personally orthodox priests) **"but are in communion with people who hold a different opinion"** (iconoclastic bishops) **must be avoided completely**.

**This creates overwhelming patristic consensus**: **St. Basil the Great** + **St. John Chrysostom** + **St. Theodore the Studite** all teaching the identical principle across different centuries. **This isn't innovation** - it's **applying the standard Orthodox principle** documented throughout patristic tradition.

During iconoclasm, Theodore declared:

> **"[Theodore] pledges to stay away from communion not only performed by a priest who complied in writing with the official policy, but also from a priest who commemorated the bishop who complied."**¹¹

**Think about what this means for Maria:** Even if Fr. Michael personally remained Orthodox, **if he commemorates Archbishop John (who embraces ecumenical compromise), St. Theodore commands complete separation**.

**St. Theodore went further**, declaring that:

> **"The church where the heretics served as well could not be used by the Orthodox until the time of a future Council that would make canonical decisions on the case."**¹²

**This created "comprehensive separation from the official church hierarchy."** **No exceptions. No compromises. No "supporting your local priest" while he commemorates heretics.**

#### Practical Solutions: Underground Orthodox Communities

**St. Theodore didn't just command separation** - he provided **practical alternatives**¹¹,¹² for maintaining Orthodox sacramental life. In his letter to disciple Naukratios (809 AD), he wrote:

> **"[Theodore] advises his disciple to rather serve the Liturgy in a private house than in a church where the priest commemorates the heretic... he explicitly mentioned 'consecrated portable altars on wood or cloth.'"**¹³

**St. Theodore encouraged faithful priests** to celebrate liturgy **"in the houses of the faithful Christians on portable altars or antimensia"** rather than compromise their Orthodox integrity.¹⁴

#### Coordinated Orthodox Resistance

**St. Theodore organized comprehensive Orthodox resistance.** Between 815-818 AD, **he wrote extensively**¹⁵ coordinating Orthodox response to iconoclastic persecution.

**St. Theodore provided practical guidance**¹⁶ for Orthodox Christians forced to **"stay away from canonical communication with the hierarchy and clergy that complied with the official line."** This created **organized Orthodox alternatives** to contaminated hierarchical structures.¹⁷

#### The Studite Monastery: Proof of Separation in Practice

**Theodore's own monastery** provides the most concrete historical example of what Orthodox faithful actually chose when facing exactly Maria's situation.

When **Abbot Leontios** initially **"adopted the iconoclast position and won over many individual monks to his party,"** the orthodox monks in the monastery faced the **exact choice Maria faces**:

**Stay and participate** in liturgies where iconoclastic bishops were commemorated, **or separate completely**.

**What did the orthodox monks choose?** According to historical records: **"Those who remained orthodox refused to participate in liturgies under the compromised abbot."** The result? **Theodore's monastery was eventually "filled with iconoclastic monks" as the orthodox monks were driven out rather than participate**.⁴³

**Let that sink in**: These monks **chose exile from their own monastery** rather than attend liturgy where iconoclastic bishops were commemorated. They **chose homelessness** rather than violate the canonical principles we established in sections 1-3.

**They understood**: **No liturgy is better than contaminated liturgy**.

**"These weren't theoretical principles - orthodox monks literally left their own monastery rather than attend compromised liturgies.", Maria thought. "If monks would abandon their monastery, how can I think attending my parish while 'mentally disagreeing' is somehow acceptable?"**


### Orthodox Patriarchs: Even the Highest Hierarchs Chose Separation

**Multiple Orthodox patriarchs demonstrated that even the highest hierarchs chose separation over compromise** when facing heretical imperial policies.

#### Patriarch Germanus I: First to Separate (726-730)

**When Emperor Leo III issued his iconoclastic decree in 726**, **Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople** faced the foundational choice: compromise with heresy or separate.

**Germanus chose separation.** According to **Theophanes the Confessor's Chronicle**, **Germanus refused to accept the imperial decree and resigned in 730 rather than participate in iconoclastic liturgies.**³⁸

**Think about this:** **A sitting Patriarch resigned his patriarchate** rather than do what many laypeople today are told is acceptable - participating in liturgy while mentally disagreeing with heretical hierarchy.

#### Patriarch Nicephorus I: Exile Over Accommodation (806-815)

**Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople (806-815)** continued the pattern during the second iconoclastic period.¹⁹,²⁰ When **Emperor Leo V resumed iconoclasm in 815**, Nicephorus chose to **"steadfastly refuse to comply with imperial demands"** rather than accommodate heretical policy.²¹

**The result:** **Leo V deposed and exiled Nicephorus**, who **continued defending Orthodox truth until his death in 828.**²²

Maria paused, processing what she'd learned. **"If Orthodox patriarchs chose exile over compromising with heresy, what does that mean for me? If even patriarchs couldn't find a way to 'work within the system' when hierarchy embraced heresy, how can I think I can just attend liturgy and mentally disagree?"**

### Orthodox Saints: Death Rather Than Compromise

**Orthodox monastics became the backbone of resistance**²⁴,²⁵,²⁶ to iconoclastic policies, with monasteries serving as **"the mainstay of icon veneration, giving the true believers the spirit to oppose the iconoclasts."**²⁷

#### Orthodox Saints: Death Rather Than Compromise

**St. Stephen the Younger (713-765)** and countless other Orthodox saints²⁸,²⁹ demonstrated **complete refusal to compromise** with heretical hierarchy. **Stephen refused all attempts at conversion** by iconoclastic authorities and was **martyred for maintaining Orthodox truth.**³⁰

**The crucial principle:** Orthodox saints **chose death over submission to heretical bishops.** **Every Orthodox Christian today venerates these saints** for their uncompromising resistance to hierarchical heresy.

#### The Orthodox Response: Truth Over Submission

**St. Theodore organized active resistance** to iconoclastic policies, including **public demonstrations with holy icons** in direct defiance of imperial prohibition.³¹ The result was **immediate exile**.

**The crucial principle St. Theodore established:** **Orthodox truth takes absolute precedence over submission to heretical authority.**

**"This changes everything,"** Maria realized. **"Orthodox saints didn't try to 'work within the system' when hierarchy embraced heresy. They chose resistance and separation over compromise. They didn't make excuses or try to find middle ground. They just... separated."**

### Orthodox Laypeople: Complete Liturgical Avoidance

**Orthodox laypeople during iconoclasm understood exactly what we established in Chapters 1-2**: attending liturgy where heretical bishops are commemorated creates **unavoidable spiritual contamination.**

**Faithful Orthodox Christians**³² would **"stay away from canonical communication with the hierarchy and clergy that complied with the official line"** because such communication was deemed **"unacceptable"** for canonical and doctrinal reasons.³³

**This was the standard Orthodox response** to hierarchical heresy - **complete liturgical separation.**

**St. Theodore provided practical guidance** for Orthodox Christians who had to **"stay away from canonical communication with the hierarchy."** Orthodox communities developed **alternative sacramental practices** including **private liturgical celebrations** and **portable altars** to maintain Orthodox sacramental life.³⁴

#### Popular Orthodox Resistance: Specific Historical Examples

**Orthodox laypeople demonstrated widespread resistance** to iconoclastic policies.³⁹ The sources document **significant popular opposition** to heretical imperial policies throughout the iconoclastic periods.⁴⁰

**Specific examples of lay resistance include:**

**Alexandria's Cemetery Chapels**: When Arian bishops controlled the main churches, **Orthodox laypeople built chapels in cemeteries** and held separate liturgies rather than commune with heretics. They understood that **physical separation preserved spiritual purity**.³⁹ᵃ

**The Samosata Resistance**: When Emperor Valens tried to install an Arian bishop in Samosata, **the Orthodox laypeople threatened armed resistance**. The emperor backed down, proving that **organized lay resistance could defeat imperial-episcopal heresy**.³⁹ᵇ

**The Edessa Demonstrations**: Orthodox laypeople in Edessa **physically blocked Arian clergy from entering churches**, with women and children forming human chains. When threatened with violence, they declared they would **"die rather than commune with heretics."**³⁹ᶜ

**Orthodox laypeople understood the stakes:** Allowing heretical authority to compromise Orthodox truth was **spiritually unacceptable**. They exercised their baptismal authority to **"test the spirits"** (1 John 4:1) and reject false teaching regardless of its hierarchical source.

### The Orthodox Theological Foundation: Why Separation Was Mandatory

**St. Theodore's resistance was grounded in fundamental Orthodox ecclesiology**⁴²,⁴³ - the understanding that **"the foundations of the Church's unity are not administrative and institutional, but Eucharistic and charismatic."**⁴⁴

**Heretical bishops became "pseudo-bishops"** and **"pseudo-teachers"** who could **"neither constitute the center of the Eucharistic Assembly nor fulfill the duties of a Shepherd, since he is already a 'wolf.'"**⁴⁵

**St. Theodore made the crucial distinction:** Separation was **not from the Church** but **from heretics** who, despite maintaining institutional positions, **"are not the Church of God"** and **"are not the Church of the Lord."**⁴⁶

**The devastating theological conclusion**: The heretics themselves were **cut off from the Church**, and **"all those who commune with them are 'themselves in truth' cut off from the Church."**⁴⁷ **Attending their liturgies didn't maintain Church unity** - **it severed you from the Church.**

### Orthodox Alternatives: Practical Solutions for Separation

**St. Theodore didn't just command separation** - he provided **practical Orthodox alternatives**³⁵,³⁶ for maintaining sacramental life:

**Private Liturgical Celebrations**: Theodore encouraged **"faithful priests to rather serve the Liturgy in the houses of the faithful Christians on portable altars or antimensia."**³⁷

**Complete Pastoral Guidance**: Theodore's extensive correspondence addressed **practical questions about maintaining sacramental life while avoiding communion with heretical clergy.**³⁸

#### The Underground Orthodox Network: How Separation Actually Worked

**The practical implementation was comprehensive.** Historical sources document the systematic approach:

> **"Underground liturgical practices developed throughout the empire. Studite monks performed liturgies privately when official churches were controlled by iconoclasts, using panel icons as altars in ordinary houses. They maintained separate sacramental life from the official hierarchy while developing alternative networks for orthodox communion."**⁴⁷ᵃ

**The practical model**: When the official hierarchy becomes canonically compromised, Orthodox faithful **create alternative structures** rather than violate canonical prohibitions.

**Orthodox faithful didn't try to "maintain unity" with iconoclastic hierarchy.** Instead, **"entire regions created entirely separate liturgical communities"** and **"followed deposed orthodox patriarchs rather than attend liturgies commemorating heretical replacements."**⁴⁷ᵇ

**Maria understood**: **"This proves separation actually worked. They didn't just avoid bad liturgies - they created good ones. Orthodox life continued and flourished through separation, not compromise."**

**This wasn't theoretical** - it was **practical Orthodox survival** providing **real alternatives** during hierarchical crisis.

### The Clear Orthodox Choice During Crisis

**For Orthodox Christians during iconoclasm, the choice was crystal clear:**

1. **Attend liturgy commemorating iconoclastic bishops** = participate in heretical communion and **spiritual contamination**
2. **Stay away from contaminated liturgies** = preserve Orthodox purity and **canonical obedience**
3. **Organize alternative Orthodox liturgical life** = maintain sacramental access **without compromise**

**The overwhelming Orthodox consensus**³⁹,⁴⁰ chose options 2 and 3. **Those who chose option 1** were later seen as having **compromised Orthodox truth**.

**There were no exceptions.** **No "good priest, bad bishop" rationalizations.** The Orthodox response was **complete separation from contaminated commemoration.**

### Complete Orthodox Vindication: Every Separator Was Right

**The Triumph of Orthodoxy (843 AD)** provided **complete vindication**⁵⁶,⁵⁷,⁵⁸ of every Orthodox Christian who had separated:

**Empress Theodora and Patriarch Methodius** restored icon veneration and **"disposed of and replaced a great number of iconoclast bishops."**⁵⁹ **The heretical hierarchy was completely purged.**

#### Canon 15: Written Specifically to Vindicate the Separations

**Remember Canon 15** that we mentioned in section 2? **It was written specifically to vindicate these separations**.⁴⁷ᶜ

After iconoclasm ended, the **First-Second Council of Constantinople (861)**, presided over by **St. Photios the Great**, officially declared:

> **"Those who, on account of some heresy condemned by holy Synods, or Fathers, withdrawing themselves from communion with their president, who, that is to say, is preaching the heresy publicly, and teaching it bareheaded in church, such persons not only are not subject to any canonical penalty...but, on the contrary, they shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians. For they have defied, not Bishops, but pseudo-bishops and pseudo-teachers."**⁴⁷ᵈ

**The canon's language is revolutionary**: It doesn't just permit separation from heretical bishops - it commands that such separators **"shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians."**

**The theological reasoning is devastating**: When bishops embrace heresy, **they cease to be bishops at all**. They become **"pseudo-bishops and pseudo-teachers"** with no legitimate claim to obedience. **Those who separate from them aren't rebelling against the Church** - they're **preserving the Church** from those who have already separated themselves through heresy.

**Translation**: Those who separated from iconoclastic bishops **"deserve honor rather than penalty."** The Church officially vindicated **exactly the behavior** we've described in sections 1-3 - and **commanded that the faithful who exercise this authority be honored for their Orthodox faithfulness**.

**Notice the canonical language**: They **"withdrew from communion"** with bishops **"preaching heresy publicly."** This is **exactly what ecumenical bishops do** when they officially partner with Protestant churches and sign heretical documents.⁴⁷ᵉ

**Every saint who separated was canonized:**⁶¹,⁶²,⁶³,⁶⁴ St. Theodore, St. Stephen, St. John of Damascus, St. Nicephorus, and **countless others who chose separation over compromise.**

**Not a single Orthodox Christian** was ever condemned for **separating from iconoclastic hierarchy**. **Every single one** was vindicated.

### The Perfect Parallel to Today

**As Maria studied the Orthodox response to iconoclasm, the parallel to her situation became undeniable:**

**During iconoclasm**: Orthodox priests served under heretical bishops who were commemorated in every liturgy. Orthodox Christians understood that **attendance created spiritual communion with heresy**.

**Today**: Orthodox priests serve under bishops who participate in ecumenical activities and are commemorated in every liturgy. **The same liturgical principles apply** - attendance creates spiritual communion with compromise.

**The Orthodox response then**:
- **Complete separation** from contaminated liturgies
- **Alternative Orthodox liturgical communities** (private homes, portable altars)
- **Absolute refusal to compromise** despite institutional pressure
- **Canonical vindication** of every person who separated

**The Orthodox response now**: **Should follow identical principles**, applying the same theological understanding to contemporary crisis.

Maria felt her heart racing as the implications hit her. **"If separation was MANDATORY during iconoclasm,"** she thought, **"then what does Orthodox tradition require when facing something similar today?"**

### The Obvious Objection

The next Sunday after liturgy, Maria could barely contain her excitement. She pulled her friend aside and told her everything she'd learned about iconoclasm - Canon 15, St. Theodore's separation, the vindication of every Orthodox Christian who had resisted heretical hierarchy.

**"Don't you see?"** Maria said breathlessly. **"This is exactly what we're facing! The Orthodox response to iconoclasm shows us what to do when bishops compromise Orthodox truth!"**

Her friend looked at her with concern. **"Maria, you're getting carried away. Iconoclasm was obviously much worse than anything happening today. Icons are fundamental to Orthodoxy - that was a massive heresy attacking the very heart of our faith. What Archbishop John is doing with ecumenical dialogue doesn't even compare. None of that iconoclasm stuff is relevant to our situation."**

### The Initial Doubt

**Walking home, Maria felt deflated.** **"Maybe my friend is right,"** she thought. **"Iconoclasm was this huge thing - emperors destroying icons, 338 bishops in council, saints being martyred. Ecumenism seems so... ordinary in comparison. Meetings with other Christians, talking about dialogue and unity. How could that possibly be as serious as iconoclasm?"**

**Maria almost convinced herself to drop the whole issue.**

### But Something Started to Nag at Her

**But over the next few days, something kept bothering Maria.** **"Wait,"** she thought. **"Is that actually true? Is iconoclasm really worse than ecumenism? How do they actually compare in scale, or scope, or severity?"**

**The more she thought about it, the more she realized:** **"I don't actually know enough about ecumenism to make that comparison. What if my friend is wrong? What if I'm wrong? How can I know for sure whether iconoclasm was worse than what's happening today unless I actually understand what ecumenism teaches and does?"**

**Maria knew she had to find out.** **"Before I dismiss the iconoclasm precedent, I need to understand: exactly how serious IS ecumenism compared to iconoclasm?"**
