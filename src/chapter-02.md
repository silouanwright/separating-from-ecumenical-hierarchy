## Chapter 2: Why You Can't Separate Yourself from Your Bishop's Actions

**As we established in Chapter 1**, liturgical commemoration creates unavoidable spiritual unity between you and your bishop. Every Divine Liturgy, your priest declares that your bishop "rightly teaches the word of Your truth" and offers him to God as part of the Eucharistic sacrifice. **You participate in this declaration** through your attendance and communion.

**But what happens when your bishop is NOT rightly teaching Orthodox truth?** What if your bishop embraces heretical teachings or participates in heretical activities? Can you attend liturgy at your traditional parish and remain spiritually separate from your bishop's problematic actions?

**Orthodox tradition gives a clear answer: No, you cannot.**

### Maria's Growing Concern

After understanding her spiritual connection to the bishop being commemorated in the liturgy and how she's not separated from that, Maria started learning about what Archbishop John actually did and taught. She found photos of him embracing the Pope at interfaith gatherings. She read his statements about "our shared Christian unity" with Catholics and Protestants. She discovered he had signed documents calling for "restoration of Christian unity" that seemed to treat all denominations as equally valid paths to Christ.

What she discovered unsettled her deeply.

"I didn't know anything about my bishop before," Maria told her friend after church. "But now that I know more about what he's doing, I'm wondering if I'm somehow affirming some of the problematic things he's involved in when Fr. Michael declares that he 'rightly teaches' Orthodox truth."

Her friend was quick to dismiss her concerns. "What the Archbishop does is separate from our parish. Fr. Michael our priest, is traditional. Our parish follows all the proper practices, and that protects us from the Archbishop and any problematic things he might do. We're not responsible for what our bishops do. Our priest isn't responsible for what our bishops do either. So it doesn't matter. Fr. Michael is Orthodox - he just has to commemorate the Archbishop, but that's just ceremonial. What the Archbishop does doesn't affect us."

Mary nodded... but later thought: **Is that true?** Can you really separate yourself from your bishop's actions when he's commemorated in every liturgy?

### Maria's Shocking Discovery During Prayer

After her friend's explanation, it made sense to Maria and she didn't really question it further. Her friend's reasoning seemed logical - their priest was Orthodox, their parish was traditional, so they were protected from whatever distant bishops might do.

Later that week, Maria was at home doing her prayer rule and reading the lives of the saints, as her priest had encouraged her to do. She happened to be reading the life of St. Theodore the Studite when she came across a teaching that made her blood run cold:

> **"The Mystery is defiled merely by the commemoration of the heretical bishop, even if everything else about the priest is orthodox and proper in the celebration of the Liturgy."**¹⁸¹

— St. Theodore the Studite

Maria sat back in her chair, stunned. **"Wait a second,"** she thought to herself. **"That's not what my friend said at all. This saint is saying that even if my priest is completely Orthodox, the Eucharist itself becomes DEFILED just by commemorating a heretical bishop? Nobody ever told me this. If this is what one of our greatest saints taught, why doesn't anyone know about it?"**

She realized that the "common sense" approach her friend had suggested directly contradicted the teaching of one of Orthodoxy's most respected saints.

**"But who was this St. Theodore?"** Maria wondered. **"What gave him the authority to make such a shocking statement? And why should I trust his teaching over what everyone tells me today?"**

### The Saint Behind the Theological Bombshell

As Maria researched St. Theodore's life, she discovered something remarkable that gave his teaching devastating authority.

**St. Theodore the Studite (759-826 AD)** wasn't just any theologian making abstract statements. He was **one of the greatest Confessors in Orthodox history** who had **lived through exactly the same situation Maria was facing**: **Orthodox priests serving under heretical bishops.**

During the iconoclastic persecution, many priests personally remained orthodox while their bishops embraced heresy. **Many Orthodox laypeople during iconoclasm made the same argument Maria's friend was making**: "Our priest is orthodox and traditional. He personally doesn't believe in iconoclasm. He just has to obey his bishop. What the bishop believes doesn't affect us since our priest is orthodox."

**This exact reasoning was tested during one of the greatest crises in Orthodox history** - and St. Theodore, who lived through that crisis, gave the definitive Orthodox answer.

**St. Theodore was asked this exact question** by concerned Orthodox Christians who wanted to know whether it was safe to attend liturgy celebrated by orthodox priests who commemorated heretical bishops.

**His answer - the quote Maria had discovered - completely destroys every "good priest, bad bishop" rationalization. She wanted to read it again.**

> **"The Mystery is defiled merely by the commemoration of the heretical bishop, even if everything else about the priest is orthodox and proper in the celebration of the Liturgy."**¹⁸¹

— St. Theodore the Studite

ccording to **St. Theodore the Confessor**, even when the priest is personally Orthodox and celebrates the liturgy perfectly, **the Mystery becomes defiled** simply by commemorating a heretical bishop.

**St. Theodore the Studite explains what this means for you to be in communion with a heretic:**

> **"For to commune with a heretic or one openly reproached in life alienates one from God and reconciles one with the devil."**¹⁸²

**St. Theodore made this principle systematic through what he called the "Three-Tier Principle of Contamination" during iconoclasm:**¹⁸³

1. **Direct heretics** (bishops embracing heresy)
2. **Commemorators** (priests who commemorate heretical bishops)
3. **Participants** (laypeople receiving communion from commemorating priests)

This is a critical framework to understand the rest of this text.

**Theodore taught that all three categories  of participants (the commemorated, the commemorators, and particupants) all become spiritually contaminated** if the commemorated are heretics.

This 3 tier formula codifies the earlier teacching that the liturgical structure itself creates unavoidable spiritual unity that cannot be broken by mental disagreement.

### Maria's Self-Realization

As Maria read through St. Theodore's framework, the personal implications hit her.

**"Wait a minute,"** she thought. **"If Archbishop John is embracing ecumenical heresy, that makes him a 'direct heretic' in St. Theodore's first category. And Fr. Michael commemorates Archbishop John every single liturgy, which makes Fr. Michael a 'commemorator' in the second category. And I receive communion from Fr. Michael... that makes me a 'participant' in the third category. According to St. Theodore the Studite, I'm in that third tier."**

**"Fr. Michael is a good and faithful priest. But St. Theodore is saying that doesn't matter. The chain goes: heretical bishop → commemorating priest → participating laypeople. And that seems like that's what's happening to me. Am I wrong? Am I getting something wrong here?"**

**"If that's the case, I'm not separate from Archbishop John if he's preaching heresy or connected with heretics. According to this great Orthodox saint, I'm spiritually connected to them through the liturgical structure itself. Every time I receive communion, I'm participating in that very thing I thought I was avoiding."**

**Think of it like food contamination.** You wouldn't eat food prepared in a contaminated kitchen, even if the local cook was personally clean. Similarly, Orthodox theology teaches you shouldn't receive communion at liturgy where heretical bishops are commemorated, even if your priest is personally Orthodox.

### Mt. Athos: The Official Orthodox Teaching

**Mt. Athos - the Holy Mountain where Orthodox monasticism has been practiced unchanged for over 1000 years** - provides the definitive Orthodox explanation. When the Emperor tried to force union with Rome in the 13th century, the monks of Mt. Athos wrote to him explaining why liturgical commemoration creates real spiritual communion:

> **"The Orthodox Church of God from the very beginning has acknowledged that mentioning a hierarch's name inside the sanctuary means complete communion with him... when the celebrant commemorates the bishop's name, he thus demonstrates his submission to a superior, and that he is in communion with him, and a follower of him in the Faith and in the holy Mysteries."**

Mt. Athos today maintains the same position, declaring in 1980 that **"our holy Orthodox Church is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ, which possesses the fulness of grace and truth."**

**The Mt. Athos teaching is crystal clear**: Commemoration **equals** communion.

There is NO such thing as commemorating someone liturgically, while remaining spiritually separate from their beliefs and actions.

This is another important point. Commemoration & participlation equals "communion". And as we'll see later, the saints repeatedly warn us not to be in communion with heretics.

### The "Good Priest" Question Answered

**St. Theodore the Studite also addressed whether priests who commemorate heretical bishops can remain Orthodox themselves.** Writing about a bishop who personally confessed Orthodox faith but commemorated his heretical Metropolitan, St. Theodore declared:

> **"If he is himself in heresy by commemorating that man, even if he claims to have sound thinking, he is not someone who ordains to the truth, nor are those he ordains in reality ministers of God."**¹⁸⁷

A priest who commemorates heretical hierarchs **becomes "himself in heresy"** regardless of his personal Orthodox beliefs. Even when he "claims to have sound thinking,"**the act of commemoration makes him a heretic.**"

So again, the action of a priest commemorating a heretics, makes him a heretic. This is according to St. Theodore the Studite.

### The Wedding Analogy: You Cannot Attend While Disagreeing

Think of liturgical commemoration like attending a wedding ceremony. When you attend a wedding, you're not just watching - you're witnessing and affirming the union. You cannot attend a wedding while disagreeing with the marriage - your attendance itself constitutes participation and approval.

**Orthodox theology works the same way.** You cannot attend liturgy where your bishop is commemorated while disagreeing with his theological positions - your attendance itself creates spiritual unity with whatever your bishop believes and does.

### The Canonical Foundation: Why "I Don't Agree with My Bishop" Doesn't Work

Many Orthodox laypeople think: **"Whatever my bishop and patiarch do, doesn't concern me, even if they avow heresy publicly. All I know, is that my parish priest is orthodox, so I can attend liturgy without being affected by what my bishop does."**

**The Orthodox canonical tradition specifically forbids this mental separation approach:**

**Apostolic Canon 45**: **"Let any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended"**

**Apostolic Canon 65**: **"If any cleric or layman enters into a synagogue of Jews, or of heretics, to pray, let the former be deposed and let the latter be excommunicated"**

**Canon 33 of Laodicea**: **"No one shall join in prayers with heretics or schismatics"**

**Notice**: These canons don't say "Don't agree with heretics" - they say **"Don't pray with heretics."** When you attend liturgy where heretical bishops are commemorated, as we have explained through the patristic witness of the liturgical structure, **you are literally "joining in prayer with heretics"** through the commemorative structure of the liturgy.

### The Patristic Consensus on Spiritual Contamination

**St. John Chrysostom** provides devastating clarity on communion with heretics. He taught what Orthodox theology calls the "discernment principle" for episcopal authority:

> **"What then, you say, when he is wicked should we obey? Wicked? In what sense? If indeed in regard to Faith, flee and avoid him; not only if he be a man, but even if he be an angel come down from Heaven."**^B1^

**St. John Chrysostom makes the practical application absolutely clear**: **"Do not have any communion with them (heretics)—do not eat with them, do not drink, do not bind friendships with them,"** and he **"loudly declares not only heretics, but also those who have communion with them, to be enemies of God."**^B2^

**This teaching establishes that episcopal authority derives from faithfulness to apostolic teaching, not merely from ordination.** **St. John Chrysostom is confirming St. Theodore's Three-Tier Principle** - this isn't just one saint's interpretation, but the consistent Orthodox teaching across centuries.

**St. Theodore the Studite** provides additional devastating teaching on why communion with heretics carries such severe spiritual consequences:

> **"Even if one should give away all his possessions in the world, and yet be in communion with heresy, he cannot be a friend of God, but is rather an enemy."**

**This is devastating**: According to **St. Theodore the Confessor**, **even perfect almsgiving and complete self-sacrifice cannot compensate** for **communion with heretics**. **No amount of good works** can overcome the **spiritual contamination** created by **participating in heretical communion**.

> **"Guard yourselves from soul-destroying heresy, communion with which is alienation from Christ."**

**The saint's teaching is absolute**: **Communion with heretics equals alienation from Christ**. When you attend liturgy where ecumenical bishops are commemorated, **you create the exact "communion with heretics"** that **St. Theodore declares "alienation from Christ."**

**St. Theodore explains why even indirect communion with heretics causes spiritual destruction**:

> **"Regarding the Faith, the heretics were utterly shipwrecked; but concerning the others, even if in their thinking they did not founder, nevertheless, on account of their communion with heresy, they too were destroyed alongside the others."**

Even if **personal faith remains Orthodox**, **communion with heretical hierarchs through liturgical attendance** causes one to be **"destroyed alongside"** the heretics. **St. Theodore teaches** that **indirect participation in heresy** through **communion with heretics** produces the **same spiritual destruction** as **direct heretical belief**.

### St. Mark of Ephesus: Complete Refusal of Heretical Communion

**St. Mark of Ephesus**, the sole Eastern bishop to reject the false union of Florence, provides the ultimate example of refusing heretical communion. On his deathbed, he declared:

> "I do not desire, in any manner and absolutely, and do not accept communion with him [the Patriarch] or with those who are with him, not in this life nor after my death."

His Encyclical Letter (1440) explained the theological reasoning:

> "Let no one dominate in our faith: neither emperor, nor hierarch, nor false council, nor anyone else, but only the one God, Who both Himself and through His Disciples has handed it down to us."

**This shows the absolute refusal** that Orthodox tradition requires when hierarchs embrace heretical positions. **St. Mark would not accept communion** even with Orthodox hierarchs who had accepted the false union - because **communion with those who commune with heretics** makes you **complicit in their heresy**.

### What This Means for Maria

After learning about St. Theodore the Studite's teaching, Maria understood her situation clearly:

When Maria attends liturgy where Archbishop John is commemorated:
- She participates in prayers declaring that Archbishop John "rightly teaches" Orthodox truth
- She affirms through her presence that he deserves to be offered to God as an Orthodox teacher
- She enters into spiritual communion with his ecumenical beliefs and actions

**Orthodox tradition teaches that this spiritual contamination is unavoidable** - regardless of her personal disagreement with Archbishop John's actions.

### Building Toward the Historical Response

Maria now understands both **what liturgical commemoration is** and **why it creates serious spiritual consequences**. But she wonders: **"Have Orthodox Christians ever faced this situation before? How did they respond?"**

**As we will establish in the next chapter**, Orthodox Christians during iconoclasm faced exactly this situation - orthodox priests under problematic bishops. Their response provides the perfect precedent for understanding how Orthodox tradition handles these complex situations.
