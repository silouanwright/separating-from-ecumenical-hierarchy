## Chapter 7: The History of Ecumenism

### The Protestant Origins of Modern Ecumenism: How Orthodox Hierarchs Surrendered to Alien Ecclesiology

**Modern ecumenism didn't emerge from Orthodox theology**. It represents **Orthodox surrender to Protestant missionary frameworks** established decades before any Orthodox involvement.

**The story begins in Edinburgh, Scotland, 1910**. Protestant missionary leaders - John Mott and others - organized the World Missionary Conference. This was **a purely Protestant gathering** designed to coordinate Protestant evangelization efforts worldwide.

**Crucially**: **"Long before the 1920 encyclical [from the Ecumenical Patriarchate]... the presuppositions and parameters of encounter were set and they did not, even in the slightest, reflect or even acknowledge Orthodox ecclesiological principles."**

**The Edinburgh Conference established the "invisible church" ecclesiology** fundamental to all subsequent ecumenical activity. This Protestant innovation teaches that the true church transcends visible institutional boundaries - **a doctrine completely alien to Orthodox teaching** that the visible Orthodox Church is the one true Church of Christ.

**John Mott and other Protestant leaders** then systematically targeted Orthodox Christians for inclusion. But they wanted Orthodox participation **"on their terms, accepting their methodology and their goals,"** as **New Hieromartyr Hilarion (Troitsky)** prophetically warned. After one of John Mott's visits to Russia, this canonized saint wrote:

> **"People who deny the Church constantly speak about 'evangelical principles,' but Christianity as life is completely alien to them... Protestantism has killed the general Church life, about which the Lord Jesus Christ prayed."**²⁸¹ᵇ

**St. Hilarion** called for Orthodox Christians to **"forget all the 'federative bases'"** and **"freely give oneself up to complete obedience to the Orthodox Church"** rather than joining Protestant unity schemes.²⁸¹ᶜ

**The key betrayal came through Metropolitan Germanos (Strenopoulos)**, who **"widened the notion of the church to include all those who profess faith in Christ."** This represented **a "remarkable change of mind"** from Orthodox teaching that only the Orthodox Church possesses the fullness of Christian truth.

### The Branch Theory: The Heart of Ecumenical Heresy

**The Protestant "ecumenical movement" teaches** that **"the church in her singularity, in her unity, is something abstract, something that cannot be identified wholly or exclusively with any vision or version of the church that one sees on earth."**

**In plain English**: No church has the complete truth. All Christian denominations are **"part of the church"** under **"a kind of umbrella that embraces all of these variations."** The **"real church"** emerges only **"in that great communion of the whole in its diversity."**

**This "branch theory"** - that Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and Protestantism are three equal branches of one tree - **hijacked Orthodox terminology** to promote Protestant theology. **It's linguistic theft disguised as theological development.**

**When Orthodox Christians recite the Creed** and confess **"one holy Catholic and apostolic Church,"** we're not describing an abstract idea. **This is a direct reference to the institution fashioned by the God-man, Jesus Christ, His Church, His Body.**

**The Orthodox Church isn't one piece of a puzzle. It's the complete puzzle.** **"This concrete reality of this hierarchical faith... is the one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and things which differ from this are by virtue of that difference departing from the Church."**

### The Linguistic Challenge: When Orthodox Terms Are Appropriated

**A shocking historical fact**: The word **"ecumenism" was invented in 1937**. **No Orthodox saint, no Orthodox elder, no Church Father could have used "ecumenism" positively** because **the word didn't exist until the 20th century**.

**Church Fathers used "oikoumene" (the inhabited world) and "oikoumenikos" (universal)** to describe the **universal scope of the one true Orthodox Church**. They never used these terms to mean **"dialogue between separated churches"** - that's **a modern Protestant innovation**.

### The ROCOR 1983 Anathema: Formal Orthodox Condemnation

**The 1983 ROCOR Anathema** - representing **the formal condemnation by an entire Orthodox jurisdiction** - specifically condemns:

> **"those who attack the Church of Christ by teaching that Christ's Church is divided into so-called 'branches' which differ in doctrine and way of life... ANATHEMA!"**

**This validates the patristic consensus**: **Metropolitan Seraphim of Kythira's warning** that **"for nineteen centuries"** the Orthodox Church **"has refused to name various heretical Christian communities as Christian Churches"** receives formal anathematization by ROCOR's official condemnation.

### Contemporary Ecumenical Heresies: What Orthodox Hierarchs Have Actually Signed

**Ecumenical compromise isn't vague or theoretical**. **Orthodox hierarchs have signed specific documents containing explicit heresies** that carry **automatic canonical penalties**.

**Here's exactly what bishops have officially endorsed:**

#### The 1993 Balamand Statement: Explicit Recognition of Catholic "Churches"

**What Orthodox hierarchs actually signed:**

> "The Catholic Churches and the Orthodox Churches recognize each other as Sister Churches, responsible together for maintaining the Church of God in fidelity to the divine purpose, most especially in what concerns unity."

**Why this is explicit heresy:** This constitutes the **"branch theory"** - dividing Christ's One Church into multiple "churches." **St. John Chrysostom** declared: **"We know that salvation itself is a property of the one Church, and that no one can be outside of the catholic Church and yet share the Faith of Christ."** **St. Cyprian** taught: **"There is one God and one Christ, and one Church...Whoever has gathered elsewhere is scattering."**

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 45** mandates **excommunication** for clergy who recognize heretics as legitimate churches.

#### The Balamand Statement: "Shared Sacraments" Heresy

**What Orthodox hierarchs actually signed:**

> "What Christ has entrusted to his Church - profession of apostolic faith, participation in the same sacraments, above all the one priesthood celebrating the one sacrifice of Christ, the apostolic succession of bishops - cannot be considered the exclusive property of one of our Churches."

**Why this is explicit heresy:** This directly contradicts Orthodox sacramental theology that **valid sacraments exist only within canonical Orthodox boundaries**. **St. Athanasius** taught that heretical sacraments leave people **"polluted by irreligion rather than redeemed."** **St. Theodore the Studite** declared: **"It is impossible for those whom [a heretical bishop] ordains to be truly ministers of God."**

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 46** mandates **complete deposition** for clergy **"who have admitted the baptism or sacrifice of heretics."**

#### The 2016 Council of Crete: World Council of Churches Participation

**What Orthodox hierarchs actually signed:**

> "Certain Orthodox Churches were among the Council's founding members and later, all the local Orthodox Churches became members."

**Why this is explicit heresy:** Membership in an organization premised on **ecclesiological pluralism** contradicts Orthodox exclusivism. **Apostolic Canon 65** explicitly states: **"If any one, either of the clergy or laity, enters into a synagogue of Jews or heretics to pray, let him be deposed and let the latter be excommunicated."**

**The Orthodox resistance:** **33 bishops refused to sign** this document. **Georgian, Bulgarian, Antiochian, and Russian Churches** did not attend. **Serbian Bishop Artemije** declared:

> **"The very name 'World Council of Churches' contains the entire heresy of this pseudo-ecclesial organization."**

#### The Council of Crete: "Common Christian Witness"

**What Orthodox hierarchs actually signed:**

> "The Orthodox Church deems it important for all Christians, inspired by common fundamental principles of the Gospel, to attempt to offer with eagerness and solidarity a response to the thorny problems of the contemporary world."

**Why this is explicit heresy:** This assumes **"common fundamental principles"** exist between Orthodox and heretics, denying Orthodox exclusivity. **St. John Chrysostom** taught that heretics **"have not the least participation in Christ."**

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 11** mandates **excommunication** for **"common religious activities with heretics."**

### The Canonical Smoking Gun: Why Ecumenism Is Forbidden

**Orthodox canons couldn't be clearer** about common prayer with heretics:

**Canon 45 of the Apostles:** **"Any bishop, priest, or deacon who merely joins in prayer with heretics is to be suspended."**

**Canon 65 of the Apostles:** **"If any churchman or layman enters a Jewish synagogue or prays with heretics, let him be suspended and excommunicated."**

**These aren't suggestions. They're binding Church law** that makes ecumenical worship canonically impossible for Orthodox Christians.

**Here's the most shocking part**: **Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew himself admits these canons are binding**. In his own doctoral dissertation, he wrote that **"only the Church in an ecumenical council is able to modify or abolish ancient canons"** and these canons **"remain in effect."**

**Yet in 2006**, during Pope Benedict XVI's visit to Constantinople, **"the Pope was permitted to recite the Lord's Prayer, they censed him as though he were a canonical Bishop"** during the official Patriarchal Divine Liturgy.

**Even pro-ecumenical Archbishop Stylianos** called such practices **"tragic mistakes"** that **"lack any theological foundation whatsoever."**

**Orthodox hierarchs know the canons forbid these activities. They admit the canons are binding. Yet they continue violating them** while claiming to be Orthodox. **This is willful canonical rebellion** disguised as "pastoral love."

### Understanding Canon 15: Protection Against False Schism Accusations

**Canon 15's historical context is crucial**: It was written to **protect Orthodox faithful from being falsely accused of schism** when they separate from heretical bishops. **The canon explicitly states** that those who separate from heretical bishops **"have not sundered the unity of the Church by a schism, but have endeavoured to protect the Church from schisms and divisions."**

**This means**: When people accuse you of **"causing division"** by separating from ecumenical bishops, **they're contradicting Canon 15**. According to Orthodox canonical tradition, **you're protecting the Church from division**, not causing it. **The bishops who embrace heretical ecumenism are the ones causing division** - you're simply refusing to participate in their division from Orthodox truth.

### What This Means for Your Parish Attendance

**The uncomfortable reality:** When your priest commemorates bishops who signed these documents, **you participate in prayers that declare these bishops "rightly teach" Orthodox truth** - despite their **official endorsement of explicit heresies** carrying **automatic canonical penalties**.

**As we established in sections 1-2:** Liturgical commemoration creates unavoidable spiritual unity. **You cannot attend liturgy while remaining spiritually separate** from what your bishop has officially signed and endorsed.

**The Mt. Athos monks** explained the theological mechanics: **"The Orthodox Church of God from the very beginning has acknowledged that mentioning a hierarch's name inside the sanctuary means complete communion with him."** When bishops have signed explicit heresies, **commemorating them makes you complicit** in those specific heresies.

**This is not theoretical** - these are **actual documents** with **specific heretical statements** condemned by **specific Orthodox authorities** carrying **specific canonical penalties**. **Orthodox faithful have no choice** but to recognize these documents as **formal departures from Orthodox faith** requiring **complete rejection**.
