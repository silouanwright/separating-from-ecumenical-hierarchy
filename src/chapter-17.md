### **Chapter 18: "But You're Not a Saint"**

**Maria's Inner Monologue**: *I was buying a children's prayer book at the Orthodox bookstore when George the parish reader approached me with his usual warm smile.*

**George's Approach:**
*"Maria! Good to see you. I heard you've been helping people understand the Fathers - that's wonderful.*

*Now, the saints were holy people with a certain level of spiritual authority that comes with that holiness.*

*The rest of us... well, we're not saints. You're not a holy elder, I'm not Saint Maximus the Confessor, and our parishioners aren't saints either. I just think it rubs people the wrong way when you say 'this saint did that' and then justify doing something similar yourself. Are you putting yourself on their level?*

*We all struggle with sins and passions. We can't go off the deep end with these stories - they're mostly there to help us understand how great the saints were. I'm not saying you're doing this, but sometimes we can accidentally imply that we too are saints.*

*I think we have to be careful not to imply that we can do what they did."*

## Orthodox Teaching on Saints and Spiritual Formation

### The Nature of Canonization

**The Orthodox Church teaches that "canonization does not make anybody a saint. Canonization recognizes that someone already was, in his own lifetime, a saint."** During their earthly lives, saints consistently had the lowest possible opinion of themselves - not as false humility to gain "humility points," but as genuine recognition of their spiritual state.

When St. Athanasius opposed Arianism, **Emperor Constantius called him "enemy of the gods" and exiled him five times.** When St. Maximus the Confessor refused heretical communion, they cut out his tongue and he died in exile as a condemned troublemaker. Saints were persecuted as troublemakers during their lifetimes, not venerated.

### How Saints Were Formed Through Reading Saints

**St. Paisios of Mount Athos was formed by reading and imitating saints' lives: "From the age of eleven, I read the lives of the Saints, fasted and kept vigil. My older brother would take the books and hide them, but that didn't stop me. I would just go into the forest and keep reading there."** The future saint put on the saints' examples - fasting, keeping vigil, following their practices - while never considering himself a saint.

St. Paisios then spent his entire life calling ordinary Christians to read the saints and follow their examples, just as he had done. He gave spiritual counsel encouraging laypeople to imitate saints' virtues and practices - the exact spiritual formation that had shaped him from age eleven.

### Saints' Universal Teaching Intent

Saints put forth their teachings and examples out of fidelity to God and fidelity to the saints who came before them - for ALL Christians. They achieved their holiness by following the same principles they teach us, principles that were available to them as ordinary Christians before any recognition.

**St. Syncletike taught about "remiss and indolent souls who are easily exhausted in the struggle for good," saying we should "praise and marvel" at even their smallest good deeds, "giving them encouragement in their struggle for the good."** Saints explicitly encouraged ordinary Christians rather than creating barriers.

### Saints Who Explicitly Rejected Spiritual Elitism

**Abbess Thaisia of Leushino directly confronted objections about ordinary Christians following saints: "Why should the saints of the past be the only 'Godbearers,' and we not have God at our side?"**

**St. Philaret of Moscow stated: "The acquisition of holiness is not the exclusive business of monks, as certain people think. People with families are also called to holiness, as are those in all kinds of professions, who live in the world, since the commandment about perfection and holiness is given not only to monks, but to all people."**

**St. Theophan the Recluse received 20-40 letters daily from laypeople and answered all of them, writing works like "The Spiritual Life and How to be Attuned to It" - a collection of 80 letters written to a young Moscow society woman.** He made it his life's work to make "complex Patristic teachings accessible to the average layperson."

### Universal Commands Without Saint-Only Exceptions

The saints never add "only if you're a saint" exceptions to their teachings about separating from heretics. When St. Maximus the Confessor said "Even if the whole world should enter into communion with the heretical Patriarch, I alone will not commune," he gave no saint-only qualifications. When Canon 15 protects those who separate from heretical bishops, it contains no sainthood requirements.

**St. Basil the Great commanded all Orthodox faithful to avoid heretical bishops, calling them "Christ-merchants" who were ordained "for the destruction of the faith."** He created no saint-only and non-saint categories for this command. The saints' teachings on avoiding heresy are universal Orthodox commands.

### The Historical Orthodox Pattern: Saints Teaching All Seekers

From the beginning, Orthodox saints welcomed and taught ordinary Christians seeking to follow their examples. **The Desert Fathers regularly received "worldly visitors," and the Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Desert Fathers) records advice specifically given to these visitors - ordinary Christians asking "Give me a word, abba, how can I be saved?"**

**St. Anthony the Great's biography was written by St. Athanasius specifically so that all Christians "may bring yourselves to imitate him" - not just monastics.** The Life of Anthony became one of the most influential books in Christian history precisely because it showed ordinary people how to follow a saint's example.

**St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain addressed his prologue to the Evergetinos to "All of you who are partakers of the heavenly Orthodox calling,"** explicitly indicating universal Christian application. The tradition of saints teaching all Christians isn't Maria's innovation - it's been Orthodox practice for 1700 years.

### Every Orthodox Christian is Called to Sainthood

Orthodox theology teaches that sainthood isn't reserved for a spiritual elite - it's the goal for every baptized Christian. **Metropolitan Kallistos Ware states definitively: "Deification is not something reserved for a few select initiates, but something intended for all alike. The Orthodox Church believes that it is the normal goal for every Christian without exception."**

This doctrine of theosis means that what the saints achieved, every Christian is called to achieve. St. Athanasius's famous teaching - "The Son of God became man, that we might become god" - wasn't written for future saints, but for ordinary Christians in Alexandria.

### The False Humility of Creating Artificial Barriers

Orthodox spiritual tradition warns against the false humility that refuses to follow saintly examples. **St. Theophan the Recluse taught: "We can think ourselves humble without having a trace of true humility... The best, or rather, the only sure way to humility is by obedience and the surrender of our own will."**

When we claim to be "too humble" to follow saints' teachings, we're actually demonstrating spiritual pride - the pride that says we know better than God what level of holiness we're capable of achieving.

### Saints Weren't Saints When They Acted

The critical point George misses: saints weren't recognized as saints when they made their most important decisions. **St. Athanasius wasn't called "Saint" when he opposed Arianism - Emperor Constantius called him "enemy of the gods" and exiled him five times.** St. Maximus the Confessor wasn't "Saint" when they cut out his tongue for refusing heretical communion - he was called a troublemaker and died in exile.

If only recognized saints can follow saints' teachings, then the saints themselves couldn't have followed their own principles when they needed them most.

### Saints Following Saints Throughout History

The entire Orthodox tradition demonstrates saints learning from and following other saints. **Elder Paisios of Mount Athos desperately wanted to visit Elder Joseph the Hesychast, but was discouraged by others who claimed Joseph was "possessed and deluded." Paisios later called not visiting this fellow saint "one of the great mistakes of his life."**

This pattern repeats throughout Orthodox history: St. Macarius learning from St. Anthony, the Desert Fathers building on each other's teachings, the entire monastic tradition based on spiritual fathers guiding disciples. These relationships existed between future saints before any canonization.

### The Orthodox Church's Clear Teaching

The Orthodox Church explicitly rejects the spiritual elitism George promotes. **The Church teaches: "Everyone is challenged to manifest holiness in their lives, for we all must become saints! This is our special - and common - calling from God. It is not something reserved for the clergy, monastics, or those who are 'more pious.'"**

**St. Symeon the New Theologian taught that direct experience of God "is attainable by all who earnestly immerse themselves in the life of prayer and is essential to interpreting sacred Scriptures."** This mystical experience belongs to all earnest Christians, not a spiritual elite.

### The Icon of God in Every Person

Perhaps most importantly, Orthodox theology teaches that **when God created humanity, "He made the first ikon, and man is created to be an ikon of God, a faithful copy of the original."** During the Divine Liturgy, the priest censes both the icons of saints and the congregation with equal reverence, "seeing the image of God in the people of God."

The same divine image present in canonized saints exists in every baptized Christian. The difference lies not in fundamental nature but in how clearly this image has been revealed through cooperation with divine grace.

### St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite




### How the Church Fathers Responded to This Objection

The Church Fathers consistently addressed and rejected objections that saintly teachings were too difficult for ordinary Christians. **St. Syncletike taught: "We should laud remiss and indolent souls who are easily exhausted in the struggle for good... Indeed if such souls should display even the smallest good deed, we must praise it and marvel at it, giving them encouragement in their struggle for the good."**

**St. John Chrysostom, whose homilies were delivered to ordinary congregations, wrote: "Should you happen to be a person who has a store of many sins, do not despair. Listen to the saints, and you will be filled with comfort... The saints are physicians, and their teachings are medicines."**

Notice what Chrysostome says: we go to doctors precisely because we're sick, not because we're healthy. The saints' teachings exist specifically for struggling sinners, not for those who've already achieved perfection.

### The Purpose of Saints' Lives in Orthodox Tradition

Orthodox hagiography serves a soteriological purpose - saints' lives are written "so that it might have a salvific effect on those who encounter it." **The Greek Orthodox Archdioceus teaches that "Saints are the ultimate role models of an Orthodox Christian" precisely because "they have achieved what all Christians are called to achieve."**

When we dismiss saints' teachings as "not applicable to us," we're rejecting the very purpose for which their lives were recorded and their teachings preserved.

### The Practical Question This Raises

George's approach creates an impossible theological framework. If saints' teachings about communion, heresy, and separation only apply to saints, then:

- Who decides when someone is "holy enough" to follow them?
- How do we become saints without following saints' examples?
- Why did the Church preserve their teachings if ordinary Christians can't use them?

**The Orthodox Church teaches that "canonization does not make anybody a saint. Canonization recognizes that someone already was, in his own lifetime, a saint."** The saints achieved their holiness by following the same principles they teach us - principles that were available to them as ordinary Christians before any recognition.

### What This Manipulation Actually Accomplishes

When Orthodox faithful are told they're "not saints" and therefore can't follow saints' teachings, this creates several dangerous results:

1. **Spiritual passivity** - people stop striving for holiness because it's "not for them"
2. **Institutional control** - only clergy get to interpret what saints "really meant"
3. **Theological ignorance** - laypeople are discouraged from serious Orthodox study
4. **Compromise enablement** - standards get lowered because "we're not saints"

This is exactly the opposite of what Orthodox tradition teaches about lay responsibility and spiritual growth.

"You're right George - I'm not a saint. But can I ask you something?

When I cite Christ's words 'Take up your cross and follow me,' am I claiming to be equal to Christ? Or am I preaching the Gospel?

So if citing Christ doesn't imply a belief that I'm equal to God, why would citing the fathers imply a belief that I'm equal to the fathers?

And George, what did St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite¹⁵⁵ say was the purpose of saints' lives? To instruct Christians, right? So if their purpose is literally to instruct us, how can following their instruction be prideful?

Also, didn't St. Symeon the New Theologian¹⁵⁶ call it heretical to claim people today cannot follow the Holy Fathers' examples? Are you defending a position a saint calls heretical?

Here's what I find interesting - weren't all our beloved saints not canonized during their lifetimes? They didn't consider themselves saints either, did they? Yet they still taught and acted. So this 'you're not a saint' objection - wouldn't that same logic have silenced the saints themselves before they were recognized?

**Look, St. Paisios himself warned against this exact mentality¹⁵⁷ - he didn't want Orthodox Christians to just 'watch the struggling athletes' instead of struggling themselves. That's all I'm trying to do - follow what the saints actually taught.**

**George's Subtle Cut:**
*"I understand your enthusiasm, Maria. But those people you're quoting were saints - they had special grace we don't possess. Surely you see the difference between their spiritual authority and... well, our situation? It's humble to recognize we're not saints. Perhaps it's best to leave such complex matters to those with proper theological training."*

*As George walked away, Maria overheard him say to his wife:* **"well... unfortunately... that is what happens when people think they can read their way to salvation."**

### **Chapter 19: "You're Cherry-Picking the Fathers"**

- **Maria's Encounter**: Someone attacks her patristic research methodology
- "You're quote-mining," "taking statements out of context," "doing eisegesis with the Fathers"
- "You can find a saint quote to support anything if you look hard enough"
- **Maria's Response**: Consensus patrum principle, proper patristic interpretation vs. dismissal
- Defending legitimate use of patristic sources against methodological attacks
