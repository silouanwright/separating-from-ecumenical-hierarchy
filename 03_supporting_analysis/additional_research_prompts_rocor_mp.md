## Integration Strategy

These research prompts should be run through Claude's research function to:
1. **Strengthen the ROCOR argument** with specific documentation of MP's compromises
2. **Address remaining theoretical gaps** about different types of separation
3. **Provide practical guidance** for those considering separation
4. **Shore up historical claims** with primary source evidence

The goal is to create an airtight argument that addresses every possible objection and provides clear guidance for Orthodox faithful facing these decisions.
