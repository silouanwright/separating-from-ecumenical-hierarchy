# Research Prompts for Claude Research Function

## Core Argument Development Prompts

### 1. Historical Iconoclasm Separation Practices
**Prompt**: "Research documented cases during Byzantine iconoclasm (726-787, 814-842) where Orthodox laypeople, priests, or monks refused to attend liturgies or receive communion when their bishops or patriarchs supported iconoclasm. Include specific names, dates, locations, and primary source citations. Focus particularly on cases where local clergy were personally orthodox but commemorated iconoclastic hierarchs."

### 2. Canonical Basis for Separation
**Prompt**: "Find all Orthodox canons, Church Father writings, and synodical decisions that authorize or require separation from bishops who teach heresy or maintain communion with heretics. Include Canon 15 of the First-Second Council (861), Apostolic Canons, and any other relevant canonical sources with full citations and commentary from Orthodox canonists."

### 3. Ecumenism as Heresy Documentation
**Prompt**: "Research Orthodox theological condemnations of ecumenism as heresy, including formal synodical decisions, writings by canonized saints, and declarations by Orthodox theologians. Find documentation showing ecumenism being compared to or deemed worse than iconoclasm. Include the 1983 ROCOR Anathema Against Ecumenism and similar formal condemnations."

## Strengthening the Argument Prompts

### 4. Eucharistic Theology and Commemoration
**Prompt**: "Research Orthodox eucharistic theology regarding the spiritual effects of commemorating heretical bishops during the Divine Liturgy. Find patristic sources explaining how commemoration in the diptychs creates sacramental unity and why attending such liturgies makes one complicit in heresy. Include writings by John Chrysostom, Ignatius of Antioch, and other relevant Fathers."

### 5. Lay Authority in Orthodox Tradition
**Prompt**: "Find examples in Orthodox history where laypeople had authority or responsibility to resist heretical bishops, refuse communion, or separate from compromised clergy. Research the role of the laity during the Arian controversy, iconoclasm, and other heretical periods. Include any Orthodox teachings on when lay resistance to hierarchy is justified or required."

### 6. ROCOR Historical Positions
**Prompt**: "Research ROCOR's historical positions on ecumenism, communion with heretics, and separation from compromised Orthodox churches from 1920-2007. Find their official statements, synodical decisions, and theological writings condemning ecumenical participation. Document their specific reasons for refusing communion with the Moscow Patriarchate and other Orthodox churches involved in the World Council of Churches."

## Potential Weaknesses to Address

### 7. Counterarguments to Lay Separation
**Prompt**: "Find Orthodox sources that argue against lay people separating from their bishops or refusing communion. Research traditional Orthodox teaching on obedience to hierarchy, when separation becomes schism, and theological arguments for remaining within compromised churches. Include both historical and contemporary Orthodox positions on this issue."

### 8. Ecclesiastical Authority and Unity
**Prompt**: "Research Orthodox theology on the limits of episcopal authority, when bishops lose their authority through heresy, and the balance between church unity and doctrinal purity. Find sources on whether bishops who fall into heresy retain sacramental validity and what this means for the faithful under their jurisdiction."

### 9. Modern Orthodox Ecumenical Justifications
**Prompt**: "Find contemporary Orthodox theological justifications for ecumenical participation, including arguments that current ecumenism is different from condemned forms, that witness rather than compromise is the goal, and that separation causes more harm than participation. Include official statements from major Orthodox churches defending their ecumenical activities."

## Specific Documentation Needs

### 10. Primary Source Citations
**Prompt**: "Find primary source documentation (not just secondary references) for the following claims: Theodore the Studite refusing communion with iconoclastic patriarch, St. Maximos the Confessor separating from Monothelite hierarchs, Orthodox faithful avoiding churches during iconoclasm, and the 'two separate parties' during iconoclastic periods. Include manuscript sources, contemporary chronicles, and early hagiographical accounts."

### 11. Patristic Consensus on Heretical Bishops
**Prompt**: "Research Church Father consensus on how to treat bishops who fall into heresy. Find writings by Athanasius, Basil, Chrysostom, Cyril, and other Fathers on whether such bishops retain authority, whether their sacraments are valid, and what the faithful should do. Include any relevant canons or synodical decisions from the early church."

### 12. Historical Parallel Cases
**Prompt**: "Find other historical periods in Orthodox history (besides iconoclasm) where faithful separated from compromised hierarchs, including the Arian controversy, Monothelitism, the Union of Florence period, and any other relevant examples. Document what actions were taken, who participated, and whether such actions were later vindicated by the Church."

### 14. Orthodox Anti-Ecumenical Literature
**Prompt**: "Find books by Orthodox theologians and saints criticizing ecumenism, including works by Justin Popovich, Theodore Zisis, and other anti-ecumenical Orthodox writers. Identify any books documenting Orthodox resistance to ecumenical participation and theological arguments against the ecumenical movement."

### 15. ROCOR Historical Studies
**Prompt**: "Identify books and scholarly works on ROCOR history, particularly their separation from Moscow (1927-2007), their theological positions during this period, and their 2007 reunion. Find any books documenting internal ROCOR debates about the reunion and continuing anti-ecumenical positions within ROCOR."

### 16. The Kollyvades Movement and St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite
**Prompt**: "Research the 18th-century Kollyvades movement and St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite, focusing on their separation from and persecution by mainstream Greek Orthodox hierarchy over seemingly 'minor' liturgical and calendar issues.
