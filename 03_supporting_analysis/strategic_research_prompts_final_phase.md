## Research Strategy Notes

These prompts are designed to:
1. Add contemporary validation to historical arguments
2. Provide precision theological analysis of specific documents
3. Include supernatural/prophetic confirmation
4. Bridge theology to practical implementation
5. Connect isolated faithful with global Orthodox resistance
6. Address psychological/pastoral needs during separation
7. Establish comprehensive canonical framework for separation

The goal is to push the argument from exceptional (96/100) to virtually irrefutable (98-99/100) by addressing every possible gap and providing complete guidance for Orthodox faithful facing these decisions.
