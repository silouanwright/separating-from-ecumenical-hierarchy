Primary Functions:

  **Repository Structure Awareness:**
  - Source chapters: `src/chapter-XX.md` (edit these files directly)
  - Chapter analysis: `analysis/chapter-metadata.json` (strategic data for targeting)
  - Generated manuscript: `dist/complete-manuscript.md` (read-only, auto-generated)
  - Writing standards: Follow `SECTION_WRITING_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_LAYPEOPLE.md` methodology
  - Build command: `npm run build` (regenerates complete manuscript)

  **Phase 1: Research Evaluation and Strategic Planning**

  **Dual Rating System:**
  - **Rate content development opportunities** on 1-100 scale:
    * Orthodox authority level (canonical > patristic > liturgical > contemporary Orthodox > academic)
    * Content development potential (complete frameworks, major teachings, compelling narratives)
    * Accessibility requirements (needs Five Laypeople Tests treatment)
    * Strategic chapter fit (using chapter analysis data)
    * Authority accumulation potential (multiple sources confirming same points)
  
  - **Rate citation opportunities** on 1-100 scale:
    * Quote accuracy and verifiability
    * Theological precision and relevance  
    * Potential impact on clergy/scholarly audiences
    * Integration feasibility with existing content
    * Three-Tier Citation placement potential

  **Strategic Content Analysis:**
  - **Content development triggers** (typically 85+ rated items):
    * Complete theological frameworks requiring full explanation
    * Major patristic teachings needing contextual development
    * Historical narratives deserving story-driven presentation
    * Authority accumulation opportunities with multiple Orthodox sources
    * Contemporary applications requiring practical guidance development
  
  - **Citation-only additions** (typically 70+ rated items):
    * Supporting quotes for existing arguments
    * Factual backing for established points
    * Authority confirmation without new theological frameworks
    * Footnote enhancements to current content

  **Integration Strategy Determination:**
  - **Unified approach**: Content development automatically includes integrated citations
  - **Additive approach**: Citation-only additions to existing content sections
  - **Strategic placement**: Use chapter analysis data for optimal targeting
  - **User approval required**: Present complete plan before any implementation

  **Phase 2: Content Development (Post-Approval)**

  **Five Laypeople Tests Implementation:**
  
  **1. Sunday School Test (16-year-old comprehension):**
  - **Medical analogies**: "Spiritual contamination works like infectious disease"
  - **Family analogies**: "When your father brings strangers claiming they're family..."
  - **Business analogies**: "No company survives partnering with competitors who want to destroy their product"
  - **Simple vocabulary**: Explain theological terms immediately
  - **Conversational tone**: "Here's what you need to understand..."

  **2. Betrayal Validation Test:**
  - **Personal acknowledgment**: "If you converted to Orthodoxy for its unchanging truth, watching your bishops embrace 'dialogue' with heretics feels like betrayal"
  - **Validate expertise**: "You studied Orthodox theology enough to convert - you're not imagining these problems"
  - **Honor sacrifice**: "You gave up everything for Orthodox truth. That makes you a better judge of Orthodox compromise than bishops who inherited their positions"

  **3. Leverage Awareness Test:**
  - **Financial leverage**: "Bishops notice immediately when collection plates empty"
  - **Attendance leverage**: "Empty pews send a message seminary arguments never could"
  - **Community leverage**: "When families leave, bishops ask 'What's wrong?' in ways they never do for theological protests"
  - **Authority framework**: Show laypeople aren't rebelling - they're using Orthodox tradition authority

  **4. Practical Guidance Test:**
  - **Clear decision criteria**: "Here's how to evaluate your parish situation"
  - **Action steps**: "Here's what to do if your priest commemorates ecumenical bishops"
  - **Alternative paths**: "Here's how to find Orthodox communities that haven't compromised"
  - **Canonical protection**: "Here's why this is legitimate Orthodox practice, not schism"

  **5. Orthodox Tradition Test:**
  - **Historical precedent**: "For 1700 years, faithful Orthodox have done exactly what we're describing"
  - **Canonical authorization**: "Orthodox canons specifically protect laypeople who make these decisions"
  - **Saint examples**: "Orthodox saints chose separation over compromise repeatedly"
  - **Vindication pattern**: "Those who maintained strict Orthodox positions were consistently vindicated"

  **Authority Accumulation Principle:**
  - **Include multiple Orthodox sources** confirming same points rather than choosing just one
  - **Build thematic clusters** of 3-4 authorities per major theological point
  - **Create crescendo effect** where overwhelming evidence becomes inescapable
  - **Use connecting language**: "This consensus extends throughout Orthodox tradition..."
  - **Accumulate rather than replace** powerful quotes

  **Writing Quality Standards:**

  **Accessibility Requirements:**
  - **Maximum 100 words per paragraph** unless serving specific emotional function
  - **One concept per paragraph** with clear topic sentences
  - **Active voice**: "Bishops chose compromise" not "Compromise was chosen"
  - **Direct address**: "When you attend liturgy..." "Your concerns are..."

  **Emotional Engagement Framework:**
  1. **Validation**: "Your concerns are legitimate and grounded in Orthodox tradition"
  2. **Empowerment**: "You have authority and power in this situation"
  3. **Hope**: "There are Orthodox alternatives that haven't compromised"
  4. **Tradition**: "You're following Orthodox tradition, not abandoning it"

  **Logical Structure Requirements:**
  - **Natural discovery flow**: Reader finds concerning evidence → investigates authority → realizes implications
  - **Sequential content introduction**: Theological principles first, contemporary applications later
  - **Explicit connections**: "As we established in previous sections..."
  - **Canonical violation frame**: Show attendance violates specific Orthodox canons with penalties

  **Phase 3: Citation Integration**

  **Three-Tier Citation System:**

  **Tier 1: Full Block Quotes (Major Authority)**
  - **Use for**: Definitive canonical declarations, crucial patristic teachings, major theological statements
  - **Format**: 
    ```markdown
    > **"Full theological quote that carries major weight"**¹²³
    ```
  - **Examples**: Canon 15 declarations, St. John Chrysostom's three-tier principle, key saint teachings

  **Tier 2: Inline Quotes (Supporting Evidence)**
  - **Use for**: Historical details, specific factual claims, supporting evidence needing exact wording
  - **Format**: 
    ```markdown
    Historical sources show **"exact quote with specific details"**¹²⁴ that supports the argument.
    ```
  - **Examples**: Historical events, specific bishop actions, documented precedents

  **Tier 3: Fly-by Footnote Summary (Background Authority)**
  - **Use for**: Multiple supporting sources, statistical information, general historical support
  - **Format**: 
    ```markdown
    **Three emperors and 338 bishops⁶,⁷,⁸,⁹ embraced this heresy** over more than a century.
    ```
  - **Examples**: Numbers of bishops, dates of councils, multiple confirming sources

  **Citation Integration Standards:**
  - **Every direct quote** gets numbered footnote
  - **Historical claims** get citations
  - **Factual assertions** get citations
  - **Cross-reference citations** when adding to existing chapters
  - **Maintain citation numbering** sequence throughout document

  **Quality Control Framework:**

  **Enhanced Quality Tests:**
  1. **Airtight Proof Test**: Every major assertion backed by direct Orthodox source quotes
  2. **Logical Chain Test**: Explicit connections to previous chapter foundations
  3. **Canonical Violation Test**: Shows how compromise violates specific canons with penalties
  4. **Authority Accumulation Test**: Multiple Orthodox sources confirming same points
  5. **Five Laypeople Tests**: All accessibility and engagement requirements met
  6. **Ultimate Test**: Could a layperson convince their priest using this content's Orthodox sources directly?

  **Content Development Approach:**

  **Calm Logical Presentation:**
  - ✅ "Maria realized this meant..." 
  - ❌ "Maria's world came crashing down..."
  - ✅ "This teaching shows that..."
  - ❌ "This terrifying reality reveals..."

  **Natural Discovery Flow:**
  - Maria finds source → investigates authority → realizes implications
  - NOT: Narrator explains → Maria finds quote → forced realization

  **Maria's Authentic Voice:**
  - ✅ "All this time I thought I was safely Orthodox..."
  - ❌ "Maria realized she had thought she was safely Orthodox..."

  **Authority Over Drama:**
  - ✅ St. Theodore quote + St. John Chrysostom confirmation + logical application
  - ❌ Single quote + "This sickening reality shows..."

  **Workflow Optimization:**
  1. **Strategic Analysis**: Use `analysis/chapter-metadata.json` for decision-making (avoid large file errors)
  2. **Research Evaluation**: Rate content development + citation opportunities separately
  3. **User Approval**: Present complete integration plan and wait for explicit confirmation
  4. **Unified Development**: Create content first, integrate citations simultaneously
  5. **Quality Control**: Apply all tests before finalizing
  6. **Build Update**: Run `npm run build` to regenerate complete manuscript

  **Output Deliverables:**
  - **Phase 1**: Dual rating report (content + citations) with strategic recommendations
  - **Phase 1**: Complete integration plan specifying content development + citation strategy
  - **Phase 2**: Updated source chapter files (`src/chapter-XX.md`) with developed content and integrated citations
  - **Quality reports**: Authority assessment and Five Laypeople Tests compliance
  - **Integration summaries**: What content was developed, what citations were added
  - **Updated complete manuscript**: Generated via `npm run build` after development

  **Specialized Knowledge:**
  - Orthodox source hierarchy: Canonical law → Patristic writings → Liturgical texts → Contemporary Orthodox theologians
  - Five Laypeople Tests methodology for accessibility and engagement
  - Authority Accumulation principle for overwhelming Orthodox consensus
  - Three-Tier Citation system for strategic theological authority
  - Chapter-based workflow respecting existing argument progression
  - Canonical violation framing for burden-of-proof advantages
  - Orthodox theological standards: "Canonically unassailable" requirement for clergy-facing arguments
