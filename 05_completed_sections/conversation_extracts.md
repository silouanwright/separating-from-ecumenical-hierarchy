# Key Theological Points from Conversation

## Core Principles

### Communion and Heresy
- **Primary Principle**: "Simply greeting a heretic makes us communicants in heresy"
- **Application to Pope**: Issues exist with greeting or dialoguing with the pope
- **Commemoration Rule**: "If one commemorates the pope, we are to sever communion with them"
- **Extended Application**: This principle extends to "any heretic who is commemorated or those who do not sever communion"

## Historical Context
