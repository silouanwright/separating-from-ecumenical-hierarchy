# Important Clarification: The 1971 Old Believers Decision

## What Actually Happened in 1971

The Russian Orthodox Church Council in 1971:
- **Lifted the anathemas** placed on the old rites in 1667
- **Recognized the full validity** of the pre-Nikonian liturgical practices
- **Acknowledged** that both old and new rites are equally Orthodox

## What This Does NOT Mean

1. **NOT vindication of schism**: The Old Believers who separated and remain separated are still in schism
2. **NOT full reconciliation**: "Full communion between Old Believers and the Russian Orthodox Church has not been restored"ยน
3. **NOT saying they were "right all along"**: Rather, acknowledging their liturgical practices were valid

## The Crucial Distinction

**What was vindicated**: The liturgical practices (two-finger sign of cross, double Alleluia, etc.) were legitimate Orthodox traditions

**What was NOT vindicated**: Creating schism, refusing reconciliation, separating from the Church

## Application to Our Argument

This actually STRENGTHENS the argument about separation over ecumenism because:

1. **Shows the Church can admit hierarchical mistakes** - The 1667 anathemas were wrong
2. **Validates suffering for legitimate practices** - Those persecuted for valid traditions suffered unjustly
3. **BUT maintains that schism is wrong** - Separation must be for heresy, not mere practice differences

## The Proper Parallel

The Old Believers case shows:
- Hierarchs can wrongly condemn legitimate practices
- The faithful who suffer for truth may be vindicated
- BUT creating permanent schism over non-heretical matters remains wrong

For the ecumenism argument:
- Ecumenism = actual heresy (not just practice difference)
- Separation = following Canon 15 (not creating schism)
- Goal = preservation of Orthodoxy until hierarchy repents
