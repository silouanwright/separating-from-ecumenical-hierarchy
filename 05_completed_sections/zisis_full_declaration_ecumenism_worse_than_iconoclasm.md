# Father Theodore Zisis: Ecumenism is Worse Than Iconoclasm

## Full Text Excerpts from the March 3, 2017 Declaration

### The Key Comparison

> "In order that the comparison with Ecumenism to Iconoclasm might not be thought unfitting, here we will only take the time to say that **Ecumenism is worse than Iconoclasm in many regards**."¹

> "Apart from its many other serious dogmatic issues, through its connection with Protestantism it attacks the veneration of the Holy Icons and slanders and deprecates the most-honorable and unique person of the All-Holy-Theotokos, along with the rest of the Saints."

> "In the so-called 'World Council of Churches' we co-exist and co-mingle with these iconoclasts and haters of the saints, the enemies of the Panaghia and of the Saints, and we debase the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, transforming it from the 'pillar and ground of the truth' into something equivalent to Protestant heresies."

### The Historical Parallel

> "The black clouds of heresy have been allowed to cover and darken the blue sky of the Orthodox Faith, to divide and set at odds the Orthodox faithful, to interrupt the uninterrupted continuity and succession of the Orthodox dogmas for a nearly a hundred years. Now, however, by God's grace and cooperation, through the prayers of the All-Holy Theotokos and of the God-instructed and God-illumined Holy Fathers, we do our part to disperse the black cloud of pan-heretical Ecumenism by our fervent Orthodox confession, just as the black cloud of Iconoclasm was dispersed after having tried the Church for more than a century."

### Following the Example of Iconoclastic Resistance

> "Together with other priests—some of whom, being unable to bear the darkness any longer, have already come out into the light, **as the monks of Olympus of Bithynia did during Iconoclasm**—we have made a beginning."²

### Ecumenism as Pan-Heresy

Fr. Theodore echoes St. Justin Popovich who "described Ecumenism as a 'Pan-heresy', and the 'summation of all the other heresies'."³

> "We condemn the pan-heresy of Ecumenism and reject the pseudo-council of Crete, which has recognized heresies as churches."

## Why This Comparison Matters

### 1. Universal Orthodox Acceptance
- All Orthodox accept that iconoclasm was a serious heresy requiring separation
- The Church celebrates the "Triumph of Orthodoxy" over iconoclasm annually
- Saints who resisted iconoclasm are universally venerated

### 2. Logical Conclusion
If ecumenism is **worse** than iconoclasm, then:
- It requires at least the same level of resistance
- Separation from ecumenical hierarchs is not "extreme" but necessary
- Those who say modern separation is "too harsh" contradict Orthodox tradition

### 3. Historical Precedent Validated
- During iconoclasm: Faithful separated from commemorating hierarchs
- During ecumenism: The same response is required (and more so)
- ROCOR's pre-2007 stance was correct; their current stance contradicts this principle

### 4. The "Pan-Heresy" Argument
Ecumenism is worse because it:
- Contains elements of iconoclasm (through Protestant influence)
- Attacks the uniqueness of the Church
- Relativizes Orthodox truth
- Encompasses multiple heresies simultaneously

## Conclusion

Fr. Theodore Zisis's declaration that "Ecumenism is worse than Iconoclasm in many regards" demolishes the argument that separation over ecumenism is "too extreme." If Orthodox tradition requires separation during iconoclasm (which all accept), then it requires even stronger resistance to ecumenism. This validates both:
1. The historical practice of separation from heretical hierarchs
2. The contemporary necessity of separation from ecumenical churches
