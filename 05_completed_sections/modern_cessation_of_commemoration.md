# Modern Application of Cessation of Commemoration: Father Theodore Zisis (2017)

## The Declaration

On March 5, 2017 (Sunday of Orthodoxy), Protopresbyter Theodore Zisis, Emeritus Professor of Patrology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, publicly ceased commemoration of Metropolitan Anthimos of Thessaloniki.¹

### The Letter to Metropolitan Anthimos (March 3, 2017)

> "With sorrow, but also with much spiritual joy and happiness, I wish to inform you by means of the present letter that I am ceasing to commemorate your name during the holy services following the Apostolic and Patristic tradition as this pertains to communion with heretics on account of the fact that you, along with many of your fellow bishops, have abandoned the Holy Tradition and strayed from the path of the Holy Fathers."²

## Theological Justification

### Canon 15 of the First-Second Council (861)

Fr. Theodore based his action on Canon 15 of the First-Second Council of Constantinople (861), presided over by St. Photios the Great with 318 holy fathers present. This canon:
- Allows priests to cease commemorating bishops who are "preaching the heresy publicly, and teaching it barehead in church"³
- States that such "walling off" is **not schism** but "praiseworthy, done in defense of holy Orthodoxy"⁴
- Declares those who separate themselves "shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the honor which befits them among Orthodox Christians"

### The Heresy of Ecumenism

Fr. Theodore identified the specific heresy as **ecumenism**, particularly Metropolitan Anthimos's support of the 2016 Pan-Orthodox Council in Crete, which:
- Acknowledged the term "church" for other Christian confessions⁵
- Contradicted Orthodox ecclesiology that the Orthodox Church alone is the One, True Church
- Represented a departure from patristic tradition

## Symbolic Timing

The public declaration occurred on the **Sunday of Orthodoxy** - the day commemorating:
- The restoration of holy icons
- The reading of the Synodikon of Orthodoxy with anathemas against all heretics
- The Church's triumph over heresy⁶

## Consequences and Response

### Immediate Hierarchical Reaction
- March 6, 2017: Metropolitan Anthimos suspended Fr. Theodore from priestly duties⁷
- Reports indicate he was also excommunicated⁸
- Fr. Theodore and Fr. Nicholas Manolis (who also ceased commemoration) were summoned to spiritual court

### Fr. Theodore's Clarification
> "We declare that we know how horribly evil is schism, which is not washed away even by martyr's blood... We will return to the commemoration of our bishops when they publicly condemn the great heresy of ecumenism and proclaim the Crete 'Council' a robber council. Such is our position, and we will not deviate to the right or the left."⁹

## Significance for Contemporary Orthodox Practice

### Key Principles Demonstrated:
1. **Modern application of ancient canons** - Canon 15 remains applicable today
2. **Ecumenism as heresy** - Treating ecumenical recognition of heterodox as "churches" as formal heresy
3. **Walling off vs. schism** - Maintaining distinction between protective separation and creating division
4. **Conditions for return** - Clear statement of what would enable restoration of commemoration

### Parallels to Historical Precedent:
- Like St. Maximos the Confessor refusing communion with Monothelite patriarchs
- Like Theodore the Studite refusing to commemorate iconoclastic hierarchs
- Like St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite, condemned as a "rigorist" in 1776 for defending tradition, canonized in 1955¹
- Following the exact canonical procedure outlined by the Church Fathers

¹ The parallel is striking: St. Nikodemos was excommunicated by the Synod of Constantinople for opposing liturgical innovations, yet his positions became standard Orthodox teaching. See Constantine Cavarnos, *St. Nicodemos the Hagiorite* (Belmont, MA: Institute for Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, 1974), 15-32.

## Application to ROCOR Situation

Fr. Theodore Zisis's 2017 action provides a direct contemporary model for Orthodox in ROCOR facing similar circumstances:

### Parallel Situations:
1. **Heretical Teaching**: Just as Metropolitan Anthimos supported ecumenical recognition of heterodox as "churches," ROCOR now communes with Moscow despite its continued WCC membership
2. **Canon 15 Application**: The same canon that justified Fr. Theodore's cessation applies when any bishop maintains communion with ecumenical hierarchs
3. **"Walling Off" vs Schism**: Fr. Theodore demonstrated how to maintain Orthodox witness without creating schism - exactly the position needed for ROCOR faithful

### The ROCOR Dilemma:
- Pre-2007 ROCOR would have supported Fr. Theodore's action (cf. their 1983 Anathema)
- Post-2007 ROCOR maintains communion with the very ecumenism they once condemned
- This places faithful ROCOR members in the position of having to choose between:
  - Following ROCOR's current practice (communing with ecumenists)
  - Following ROCOR's historical witness (separation from ecumenists)

### Conclusion:
Fr. Theodore Zisis's modern application of Canon 15 validates that cessation of commemoration remains the proper Orthodox response when bishops embrace or maintain communion with the heresy of ecumenism. His example provides a roadmap for those in ROCOR who recognize the contradiction between their church's past witness and present practice.
