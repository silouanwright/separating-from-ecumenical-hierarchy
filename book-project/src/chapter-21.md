### 2016 Council of Crete Material

#### The 2016 Council of Crete: World Council of Churches Participation

**What Orthodox hierarchs actually signed:**

> "Participating in the World Council of Churches, the Orthodox Church has always insisted that its primary and fundamental concern was and remains the restoration of the unity of those who believe in Christ, our common Lord and Savior."

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 45** mandates **suspension** for clergy who **"merely join in prayer with heretics."**

**The Orthodox resistance:** **33 bishops refused to sign** this document. **Georgian, Bulgarian, Antiochian, and Russian Churches** did not attend. **Serbian Bishop Artemije** declared: **"The very name 'World Council of Churches' contains the entire heresy of this pseudo-ecclesial organization."**

#### The Council of Crete: "Common Christian Witness"

**What Orthodox hierarchs actually signed:**

> "The Orthodox Church accepts the historical designation of other non-Orthodox Christian Churches and Confessions as 'Churches and Confessions' while acknowledging the canonical and theological limitations of these designations... The common witness of the Churches in our day... contributes... to the preparation of the path towards the restoration of full unity."

### 1993 Balamand Statement Material

#### The 1993 Balamand Statement: Explicit Recognition of Catholic "Churches"

**What Orthodox hierarchs actually signed:**

> "It is clear that the Eastern Catholic Churches... have the right to exist and to act in response to the spiritual needs of their faithful."

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 45** mandates **excommunication** for clergy who recognize heretics as legitimate churches. **The 1983 ROCOR Anathema** specifically condemns **"those who attack the Church of Christ by teaching that Christ's Church is divided into so-called 'branches'...ANATHEMA!"**

#### The Balamand Statement: "Shared Sacraments" Heresy

**What Orthodox hierarchs actually signed:**

> "The Eastern Catholic Churches who have desired to reestablish full communion with the See of Rome and have remained faithful to it, have the right to exist and to act in response to the spiritual needs of their faithful."

**The canonical penalty:** **Apostolic Canon 46** mandates **complete deposition** for clergy **"who have admitted the baptism or sacrifice of heretics."**

### Contemporary Bishops Trying to Make Ecumenism Sound Orthodox

#### Metropolitan Kallistos Ware's Ecumenical Activities

**Metropolitan Kallistos Ware** - one of Orthodoxy's most respected theologians, former Oxford lecturer, and **known ecumenist who embraced the Pope, was deeply involved with the World Council of Churches, and promoted the branch theory** - provides the perfect example of how contemporary bishops try to make ecumenical compromise sound Orthodox while maintaining traditional language in Orthodox contexts.

**His documented ecumenical positions:**
- **Active WCC participation** for decades
- **"Branch theory" advocacy** treating Orthodoxy as one valid branch among others
- **Papal recognition** and formal cooperation
- **Joint theological commissions** with Catholic and Protestant churches

**Yet his traditional Orthodox language** when addressing Orthodox audiences maintains strict Orthodox terminology and appears to support Orthodox exclusivity.

**This represents the classic pattern:** Contemporary bishops **"reshape themselves"** (in St. Basil's words) depending on their audience - Orthodox language for Orthodox faithful, ecumenical language for Protestant partners.

#### The Episcopal Pattern of Ecumenical Accommodation

**The consistent pattern** among contemporary Orthodox bishops:

1. **Maintain Orthodox theological language** when addressing Orthodox faithful
2. **Participate actively** in ecumenical organizations that treat Orthodoxy as one branch among many
3. **Sign documents** that explicitly contradict Orthodox exclusive claims
4. **Deny any contradiction** exists between these activities
5. **Dismiss critics** as "extremists" or "troublemakers"

**This creates the exact canonical situation** described in **St. Basil the Great's** analysis of compromised bishops:

> "Do not be deceived by their false claims of professing the true faith. Such men are **traders of Christ, not Christians**—preferring always what is profitable in this life over the life of truth. When they thought they had secured that empty position of authority, they aligned themselves with the enemies of Christ. But when they saw the people rise in resistance, they reshaped themselves again to appear orthodox."

### Modern Ecumenical Documents Analysis

#### The Havana Declaration (2016): Patriarch Kirill and Pope Francis

*[Content moved to Chapter 9 for consolidated analysis]*

#### Analysis of "Dialogue" Language vs. Orthodox Exclusivity

**The linguistic manipulation** in contemporary ecumenical documents:

1. **"Dialogue"** replaces **"evangelism"** - treating heretics as equals rather than potential converts
2. **"Christian unity"** replaces **"return to Orthodoxy"** - implying unity exists outside Orthodox Church
3. **"Shared tradition"** replaces **"Orthodox tradition"** - legitimizing heretical innovations
4. **"Brothers"** replaces **"heretics"** - denying fundamental theological distinctions

**Each linguistic shift** represents a **canonical violation** according to Orthodox canons that forbid treating heretics as legitimate Christians.

### Contemporary Orthodox Applying Canonical Resistance

#### Cretan Priests (2017)

- **At least four priests ceased commemorating their bishops**
- Believed bishops had fallen into **"heresy of ecumenism"** by accepting 2016 council documents

**The consistent contemporary pattern**: When Orthodox hierarchs publicly embrace heretical compromises, faithful Orthodox clergy and laypeople **apply the same liturgical commemoration principles** that have guided the Church for 1700 years. **They understand** that **commemorating compromised hierarchs creates spiritual unity** with their compromises, making separation **canonically required rather than optional**.

**[Note: This material should be integrated into later chapters on canonical foundations and contemporary applications, using the Authority Accumulation principle to build overwhelming patristic consensus.]**

### Patristic Material Removed from Chapter 2 (for use in later canonical/historical chapters):

**St. Mark of Ephesus quotes:**
> "I do not desire, in any manner and absolutely, and do not accept communion with him [the Patriarch] or with those who are with him, not in this life nor after my death."

His Encyclical Letter (1440) explained the theological reasoning:
> "Let no one dominate in our faith: neither emperor, nor hierarch, nor false council, nor anyone else, but only the one God, Who both Himself and through His Disciples has handed it down to us."

**Canonical Foundation Material:**

**Apostolic Canon 45**: **"Let any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended"**

**Apostolic Canon 65**: **"If any cleric or layman enters into a synagogue of Jews, or of heretics, to pray, let the former be deposed and let the latter be excommunicated"**

**Canon 33 of Laodicea**: **"No one shall join in prayers with heretics or schismatics"**

**St. John Chrysostom** teaching: **"Do not have any communion with them (heretics)—do not eat with them, do not drink, do not bind friendships with them,"** and he **"loudly declares not only heretics, but also those who have communion with them, to be enemies of God."**

**Additional St. Theodore the Studite quotes:**

> **"Even if one should give away all his possessions in the world, and yet be in communion with heresy, he cannot be a friend of God, but is rather an enemy."**

> **"Guard yourselves from soul-destroying heresy, communion with which is alienation from Christ."**

> **"Regarding the Faith, the heretics were utterly shipwrecked; but concerning the others, even if in their thinking they did not founder, nevertheless, on account of their communion with heresy, they too were destroyed alongside the others."**

**Contemporary Orthodox Examples:**

*[Bishop Longin and Moldovan clergy examples moved to Chapter 9 for consolidated analysis]*

**Cretan Priests (2017):**
- **At least four priests ceased commemorating their bishops**
- Believed bishops had fallen into **"heresy of ecumenism"** by accepting 2016 council documents


**St. Kosmas Aitolos** (1714-1779), canonized in 1961, delivered a shocking prophecy during the 18th century when clergy and laity generally lived in harmony:

> "The clergy will be the worst and most impious of all." (Prophecy #57)

When contemporary clergy objected, **St. Kosmas** responded with prophetic authority:

> "Ah, what am I? Am I not from your class? I tell you that this one day will happen."
