## Chapter 11: "We Have to Be Obedient to Our Bishops/Priests..."

- **Maria's Encounter**: Parish Council Member confronts her about missing liturgy
- Authority/hierarchy arguments, dismissing her as unqualified single mother
- "We've been Orthodox for generations, and we've always obeyed our bishops"
- **Maria's Response**: St. Maximus opposing five patriarchs, Apostolic Constitution on avoiding destructive shepherds
- Orthodox understanding of obedience vs blind submission when bishops fall into heresy

### **Chapter 12: "Just Pray and Let God Handle It"**

**Maria's Inner Monologue**: *It's been three weeks since I stopped attending Divine Liturgy, and I've been spending Sunday mornings doing Typica with the children and studying the Fathers.*

*She sees that she's received a voicemal from - Matushka Elena, Fr. Michael's wife.*

**Matushka's Opening:**
*"Christ is Risen! Hello Maria. We all miss you at church! I heard you've been struggling with some church concerns, honey. Forgive me, but if I could offer some advice... I think the saints would tell us that we need to pray more and trust that God will provide. That's what prayer is for dear - we don't have to worry about all these complicated things. Just focus on your beautiful family and let God take care of the rest. Hope to hear from you soon."*

## Why "Just Pray" Contradicts Orthodox Teaching

Picture this: A Catholic person tells you they're spiritually fine because they pray daily. Their pastor says "just pray and trust God - that's all He wants."

Your response? "Prayer without Orthodox faith is lacking. You need to join the body of Christ, which is Orthodoxy."

Now ask yourself: Why do we suddenly forget this principle applies to Orthodox Christians as well?

We tell Catholics that prayer without certain presuppositions is ineffectual. Yet we tell ourselves to "just pray" and ignore the presuppositions as well (theology, heresy).

Either Orthodox theology matters or it doesn't.

The reason Catholics can't receive communion isn't because they don't pray - many pray more than we do. They can't commune because they need catechism and baptism, and this requires them to avow (and traditionally even memorize) the Creed, and their belief in ONE holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.

**So here's the devastating question: When bishops deny Orthodox church is one through ecumenism, and unifying themselves with haters of Orthodoxy, the saints, our Panagia, why do we suddenly say "just pray about it"? In that case, why didn't we tell the Catholic people to just pray instead of converting?

**Either Orthodox exclusivity matters enough to demand conversion, or it doesn't matter at all, if everything only requires prayer, and nothing else.**

Prayer requires Orthodox presuppositions to be spiritually effective. St. Seraphim of Sarov taught that the entire Christian life exists for acquiring grace - the commandments, canons, sacraments, everything serves this purpose.

"Prayer, fasting, vigil and all other Christian activities, however good they may be in themselves, do not constitute the aim of our Christian life, although they serve as the indispensable means of reaching this end. The true aim of our Christian life consists in the acquisition of the Holy Spirit of God. As for fasts, and vigils, and prayer, and almsgiving, and every good deed done for Christ's sake, they are only means of acquiring the Holy Spirit of God." â€” St. Seraphim of Sarov, conversation with Motovilov

**St. Maximus the Confessor** - who literally died rather than compromise with heretical hierarchy - teaches the precise relationship between prayer and obedience:

**"Prayer is a petition for blessings which come from the Word Incarnate... a vow is a decision to keep the commandments, confirmed by a promise on the part of the person making the vow; and a prayer is a petition by one who has kept the commandments that he may be transformed by the commandments he has kept."**

**Translation:** Prayer becomes effective AFTER keeping the commandments, not before. You cannot "just pray" while ignoring canonical commandments and expect spiritual transformation.

**Since the canons explicitly forbid communion with heretics, "just pray while attending compromised liturgies" violates the very prerequisite St. Maximus says prayer requires.**

**St. Theophan the Recluse** teaches what's actually required for prayer to be effective: **"It is, of course, possible for prayer alone to defeat all enemies, but in order to be strong in prayer, one must be successful in faith, hope, truth, righteousness, and all the rest."**

**Notice carefully**: He's not saying weak prayer alone is sufficient - he's teaching the prerequisites for **strong prayer**. To defeat enemies through prayer, you must FIRST achieve success in "truth, righteousness, and all the rest" - including canonical obedience.

**The person who says "just pray" while ignoring these prerequisites proves they don't understand what the saints actually teach about effective prayer.** They're asking you to use prayer as a weak substitute for the very things that make prayer strong. The reason the prayer of our saints was so strong, was that they embraced and called others to these additional virtues, in the pursuit of the acquisition of grace. Those who say otherwise manifestly show they haven't really entered into the mindset of the saints yet.

When you commune with heresy, our saints manifestly say that this repels God and his grace. Repeatedly. Our saints were not legalists. They all understood heresy repels the Holy Spirit. This is why they all, in UNISON, rejected heresy, and all the more so, did they reject the heresy of all heresies, Ecumenism (of which there is an extensive witness in Chapter X).

Therefore, "Just pray" is Protestant thinking. When you align with heretics, you become like Protestants - separated from God, and your prayers unheard. This is not our thinking, but merely what our saints in complete agreement say.

There is another image that can help one understand this.

If one is tending to a garden, and they have a bucket full of tools, a good gardener will use the best tool available for the right job. They might use a shovel in some cases, or a rake in others. They wouldn't say "I can only use the best tool, and no other tool." This doesn't make any sense. And in fact, by not utilizing all the tools available to them, their garden dies, and then the best tool is completely ineffectual. Do you see?

The person who says to "just pray" doesn't understand that we are struggling for an eternal reality, and that this necessitates using every single tool available. The person who says to "just pray" is avoiding the many other things our saints and elders teach us, that we may use all the tools in our bucket, to harvest all the grace that we can.

We as Orthodox Christians are maximalists. We are fighting for eternity. We do not simply just use the best tool, but ALL tools available to us. Using the tool we like, makes us no different from Protestants who think John 3:16 is all they need to know, and can simply discard the rest of the Bible.

If one reads the full lives of the saints, they will manifestly see that they did *not* simply just pray.

The saints demand action combined with prayer. St. Basil the Great faced identical "just pray" arguments during the Arian crisis. His response: **"Those who pretend to confess Orthodox faith but continue to commune with heretics - should not only be excluded from communion, but should not even be called brothers."** St. Basil didn't say "just pray about Arian bishops." He demanded complete separation.

St. Theodore the Studite taught that **"Everyone who resists is a Confessor"** - he called resistance "Orthodox and God-pleasing." St. John Chrysostom declared: **"Not to enable a sinner by silence and inaction is mercy; to enable a sinner by avoiding reproofs is cruelty."** The Apostolic Constitutions command: **"Care must be had to avoid destructive shepherds... that sheep which follows a bad shepherd is exposed to unavoidable death."**

Our saints teach that **following the commandments and the Fathers is the bedrock for establishing prayer.** When you ignore canonical teachings to "just pray about heretical bishops," you've adopted Protestant prayer theology while calling it Orthodox.

**Heresy affects our own acquisition of grace** whether we ourselves are heretics, or we are commemorating them, or we are part of Divine Liturgies where they are commemorated (as established by St. Theodore the Studite in his 3 tier system, explained in chapter 2). When we're spiritually united to heretical bishops through commemoration, **it directly undermines our own prayer life and capacity to receive grace.**

So "just pray while ignoring these teachings" asks you to maintain spiritual practices while participating in the very contamination that undermines those practices. **You cannot separate Orthodox prayer from Orthodox obedience.** When you align with heretics, you become like Protestants - separated from God, your prayers unheard.

**Theological Framework**: The "just pray" manipulation weaponizes Orthodox spiritual concepts against Orthodox tradition, creating false dichotomies between prayer and canonical obedience that contradict 1700 years of patristic teaching.

**Maria's Full Response**:

*"Truly He is Risen! Hello Matushka,"*

*I used to be Protestant many years ago, as you know. My problem was that I took small parts of the Bible - John 3:16 - and made this the focal point of Christianity. I look at my Bible today, which has over 700,000 words... and really, I only cared about 30 words or so. Was this Christianity? Or an idol of my own making?*

*Converting to Orthodoxy and reading the Fathers and saints, I notice that whenever the saints say something we like, we celebrate it. But when they teach something that makes us uncomfortable, we downplay it, even using their own teachings to do it. 'Practice silence.' 'Simply pray.' But isn't it possible to do both? Can we not pray AND follow the other teachings of the saints?*

*I recall a story about St. Paisios the Athonite... When a man came asking him to pray for his son, he said 'I will pray, but you will need to do something as well.' He didn't chastise him for coming. He didn't tell him to just pray. He said this required something in addition. Saints like St. Theodore the Studite, St. John Chrysostom, and St. Maximus the Confessor didn't simply restrict themselves to prayer. They sought to live up to ALL the commandments, canons, and dogmas of the Church.*

*Do we not judge the saints when we do this? Are we not picking and choose what we like, and when someone embraces the challenging teachings of the saints - not just the sweet and comforting parts - we don't like it? Are we not doing what the Protestants do in this way?"*

**Matushka's Response:**

*"Maria, honey... you used to be such a sweet Orthodox mother. What happened to you? This is exactly what happens when people get too into theology instead of just focusing on loving God and their families.*

*You're a mother, not a theologian. This isn't loving behavior toward your priest or your parish family. You've lost all that Christian love and kindness since you started this 'research.' This is what happens when converts try to become theologians instead of just being grateful for what the Church has given them. You used to be so peaceful before you started reading all this stuff.*

*Focus on your beautiful children instead of worrying about bishops you've never even met. This obsession isn't healthy, honey.*

*...I'll be praying for you, Maria."*


### **Chapter 13: "The Church Uses Economia" - Father Michael's Threats**
- **Maria's Encounter**: Father Michael learns she's been "spreading dissent"
- People have been asking her for explanations, she's simply sharing her canonical position
- His accusations: "causing scandal," "disturbing parish peace," "making it impossible to help you"
- Economia manipulation: Using pastoral flexibility to justify ignoring canonical violations
- **Maria's Response**: Economia cannot override fundamental doctrine, proper vs. improper applications
- The threat: "If you continue disturbing the peace..."
