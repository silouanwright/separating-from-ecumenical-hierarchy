## Orthodox Separation from Compromised Hierarchy: From Iconoclasm to Modern Ecumenism

## Introduction: The Central Question

A fundamental question faces contemporary Orthodox Christians: **If your local parish priest commemorates bishops and patriarchs who actively participate in ecumenism, should you attend that parish and receive communion there?**

Many Orthodox faithful assume that what happens between distant bishops and patriarchs has nothing to do with them or their spiritual life.

"My priest is orthodox, my parish is traditional. Who cares what my bishop or patriarch does?"

Upon this question, centers the following text.



so I can ignore what the patriarch does." This document demonstrates why **this assumption is theologically false** and **pastorally dangerous**.

Through careful examination of Orthodox tradition, we will establish that:

1. **Liturgical commemoration creates real spiritual communion** between all participants
2. **When heretical bishops are commemorated, all attendees participate in that heresy**
3. **Orthodox faithful have historically separated completely** from such situations
4. **This separation follows canonical Orthodox tradition** and has been consistently vindicated

This is not a call to schism or innovation, but to **faithfulness to Orthodox tradition** exactly as it has been practiced for 1700 years.

## What This Document Will Demonstrate

This argument proceeds through **nineteen chapters** that build systematically from theological foundations to practical application:

### Part I: Theological Foundations (Chapters 1-7)

In Chapter 1, we will establish that liturgical commemoration creates real spiritual "communion" between all participants, even for a lay person attending a Divine Liturgy.

In Chapter 2, we will further establish the patristic witness of our saints on being "in Communion" with heretics, which includes lay people attending churches where ecumenists are commemorated

In Chapter 3, we will learn about Iconoclasm, where

In Chapter 4, we will discover how Orthodox Christians responded during iconoclasm, so that we can understand what our behavior should be for a worse heresy.

In Chapter 5, we will set forth a principle: Ecumenism is worse than iconoclasm, establishing that the example of the faithful during Iconoclasm is all the more relevant today.

In Chapter 6, we will use the patristic witness of the saints to truly establish ecumenism as a heresy above all all heresies

In Chapter 7, we will talk about the authority that lay people have in these matters

### Part II: ROCOR Case Study (Chapters 8-9)

In Chapter 8 and 9, we will cover the history of ROCOR, and it's current state (as it relates to this topic)

### Part III: Addressing Common Objections (Chapters 10-15)

From Chapters 10 - 22, we will address all the likely objections to these sentiments.

In Chapter 23, we will cover the topic of catechism and how the lack of catechism on a multitude of topics shapes contemporary dialogue amongst Orthodox Christians.

### Part IV: Conclusion

In Chapter 24, we will finally go through some practical guidance on how you can navigate all of this, and wrap things up.

By the end, you will understand why attending Orthodox parishes that commemorate ecumenical hierarchs **participates in the very heresy** that Orthodox tradition requires us to reject - and more importantly, **how to respond faithfully** according to 1700 years of Orthodox precedent.
