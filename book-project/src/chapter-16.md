## Chapter 16: "You're just doing what the  schismatic Old Calendarists do"

**Maria's Inner Monologue**: *It's been two months since I stopped attending Divine Liturgy. Word has gotten around the Orthodox community, and I can feel the judgment when I run into people at the grocery store.*

*My phone buzzes - a text from Dr. Alexis, an Orthodox theologian I met at a conference last year. "Can we talk? I'm concerned about what I'm hearing."*

**Dr. Alexis's Encounter:**
*"Maria, I heard about your... situation with the parish. Look, I understand you have concerns about ecumenism, and some of those concerns might even be valid. But what you're doing - this separating from canonical bishops - this is exactly how schisms start.*

*You're breaking unity with the Church. The Old Calendarists did the same thing in the 1920s - they used Canon 15 to justify their separation, and look where it led them. They became a tiny, irrelevant sect outside the canonical Church.*

*You have no authority to separate from canonical bishops based on your personal interpretation of their actions. These bishops are in canonical communion with the entire Orthodox world. Who are you - a laywoman, a convert - to declare them heretical?*

*This path you're on leads to schism, Maria. You're following the exact same pattern as every group that's broken away from the Church throughout history. Don't become another Old Calendarist.*

*The unity of the Church matters more than your theological concerns. Come back before you make yourself and your family schismatics."*

### The difference between separation, schism, and apostasizing

*Maria felt her stomach drop. The Old Calendarist accusation - she'd heard it before. It was the nuclear option, the conversation-ender that made faithful Orthodox look like cranks and schismatics. But was it actually true?*

As with many concepts in the church, the topic of schism is shrouded in general misunderstanding, and through this misunderstanding, the wisdom of the saints is weaponized in a manner they never intended.

**If you've been accused of being "just like the Old Calendarists" for questioning ecumenical compromise, you need to understand why this comparison is completely wrong. The accusation is designed to shut down discussion, but Orthodox history proves the opposite.**

Let us first define key terms:

**A schismatic** is one who separates from the Orthodox Church and forms or joins a parallel Orthodox church. Examples of schismatics in history include the Old Calendarists, the Old Believers, and the Old Rite Orthodox.

Think of it this way: If your family argues about which restaurant to visit for Sunday dinner and some members start their own "family" that celebrates holidays separately, that's schism - creating division over non-essential matters.

**An apostate** is one who leaves the Orthodox Church in a way that renounces their faith. Examples include atheists and people who leave Orthodoxy for heterodoxy (Catholicism, Protestantism, non-denominational churches).

**The crucial distinction**: If one separates from the church for a matter that is *not* a matter of faith (after a certain period), they become excommunicated. However, if one separates for a matter of faith (when patriarchs and bishops have apostasized or taught heresy publicly), separation is not only permissible but lauded. This aligns with the position of the saints, as established in previous chapters.

This distinction alone may convince many that separating from a heretical bishop - which for laypeople means separating from a church that commemorates such a bishop during Divine Liturgy - is fundamentally different from schism.

However, it may help to address a big reason why people misunderstand this.

### Why the Old Calendarist Controversy Poisoned the Well

The Old Calendarist controversy has poisoned the well, making many Orthodox suspicious of anyone invoking Canon 15. Old Calendarists misused the canons to justify actual schism, so when faithful Orthodox cite Canon 15 today, people immediately assume "schismatic behavior."

This reaction is understandable but incorrect. The problem isn't Canon 15 itself - it's how the canon has been misapplied.

To see the difference between legitimate and illegitimate use of Canon 15, we need to examine the Sergianist crisis - a clear case where the canon was used properly.

### A brief explanation of Sergianism

Here's what actually happened: In 1927, the Russian Church faced a crisis. The Soviet government (an atheistic regime) demanded complete loyalty, and Metropolitan Sergius agreed - even while Orthodox Christians were being murdered. His Declaration of July 29, 1927 **fundamentally altered Russian Orthodox ecclesiology by pledging the church's "absolute loyalty" to the Soviet regime:**

> **"We want to be Orthodox, and at the same time to see the Soviet Union as our civil motherland, whose joys and successes are also our joys and successes and whose failures are our failures."**¹¹⁵

This wasn't just civil obedience - **it theologically bound the church's identity to an atheist state actively persecuting believers.**¹¹⁶ As contemporary Orthodox theologians recognized, this created **"a false separation of all the spiritual needs of man into the purely religious and the socio-political,"** requiring believers to support socialist construction while claiming this didn't affect faith.¹⁸²

**The Orthodox response was immediate and overwhelming: Up to 90% of Orthodox parishes initially rejected the Declaration,**¹⁸³ with **approximately 2,500 parishes joining Metropolitan Joseph of Petrograd's resistance movement.** The underground **"Catacomb Church" emerged immediately,** with theologians like **Hieromartyr Theodore Andreyev declaring that Sergius had violated the church's fundamental marks of unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity.**¹⁸⁴ The Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) **formally broke communion on September 5, 1927, declaring Moscow's administration "enslaved by the godless Soviet power."**¹¹⁶ᵈ

**Metropolitan Joseph of Petrograd** and **Metropolitan Cyril of Kazan** - both **legitimate successors designated in Patriarch Tikhon's will** - led the canonical resistance.¹⁸² They understood the ecclesiological gravity of Sergius's compromise. As contemporary witness Ivan Andreyev documented:

> **"After the schism of 1927, the followers of Metropolitan Sergius, who accepted his Declaration, began to be called 'Sergianists,' while those who remained faithful to the Orthodox Church, who did not accept the Declaration and separated from Metropolitan Sergius, began to be called 'Josephites' (after Metropolitan Joseph of Petrograd). Apart from Metropolitan Joseph, other hierarchs, the most outstanding ones, together with their flocks, departed from communion with Metropolitan Sergius. The religious-moral authority of those who protested and separated was so high, and their qualitative superiority was so clear, that for the future historian of the Church there can be no doubt whatever of the correctness of the opponents of Metropolitan Sergius."**¹⁸²ᵃ

They ceased commemorating Sergius and **organized alternative church structures to preserve authentic Orthodoxy** while maintaining hope for eventual restoration. Significantly, **"All those who protested against the Declaration of Metropolitan Sergius were arrested by the Soviet regime as 'counter-revolutionaries'; they were shot or sent to concentration camps and exile."**¹⁸²ᵇ

### Validation by the Church

**Here's the crucial test case: Sergius called the resistance movement "schismatics." Was he right?**

The Church's answer is definitive: **No.**

Metropolitan Joseph and Metropolitan Cyril were **canonized as saints** by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia in 1981. The Church officially recognized that their resistance was legitimate Orthodox practice, not schism.¹¹⁹

**Both saints were executed by Soviet firing squad in 1937** for their faithfulness to Orthodoxy. Their canonization explicitly validates that using Canon 15 against compromise with enemies of the faith is proper Orthodox resistance.

Metropolitan Cyril's final assessment of Sergius is telling: **"Metropolitan Sergius is departing from that Orthodox Church which the Holy Patriarch Tikhon entrusted to us."**¹¹⁷ In other words, it was Sergius who had essentially apostasized by pledging loyalty to those murdering Orthodox Christians, not the resistance who had schismed.

**So we have a perfect test case**: When bishops compromise with enemies of the faith, those who separate are vindicated as saints, not condemned as schismatics.

### Why Metropolitan Cyril's Method Differs from Old Calendarist Schism

Now that we've seen legitimate Canon 15 use validated by canonization, we can understand why the Old Calendarist approach failed canonical scrutiny.

**"Metropolitan Cyril is in the right and is following the spirit of the canon because he's aiming toward a conciliatory decision...And he's not pronouncing a judgment as if he's the counsel and the infallible voice of the church."**¹⁰⁰

 — Archpriest. Peter Heers

**Orthodox canonists confirm this approach was proper, not schismatic.** Metropolitan Cyril followed **"the spirit of the canon"** by aiming toward conciliar solution rather than declaring final judgment.¹⁸⁵,¹⁸⁶

Let us closely look at the example of the resistance movement, versus the movement of the Old Calendarist schismatics, to validate the distinctions between the two.

- **Sergius was publicly teaching submission** to an atheistic regime and denying persecution of Christians
- **These positions were condemned** by Orthodox tradition and previous councils
- **Metropolitan Cyril ceased commemoration** while maintaining that he was preserving Orthodox ecclesiology
- his resistance didn't create a fracturing of the church that continues to this day. in fact, his resiresistance protected the church. This is the true purpose of the canon, and why it was written.

### The Two Models: Metropolitan Cyril (Correct) vs. Old Calendarists (Schismatic)

**The Orthodox approach to Canon 15 separation:**
- **"We're going to separate from you, not condemn you because we're not the council to condemn you"**¹⁰¹
- **"But we're going to separate from you to protect the church from your delusion"**¹⁰²
- **"And yet they're not passing judgment. They're not saying that you're outside the church"**¹⁰³
- **"They're saying this needs to come to a council and needs to be solved"**¹⁰⁴

#### **Old Calendarist Improper Model (What We Reject):**

**The schismatic distortion of Canon 15:**
- **Treats separation as "end in itself"** rather than means to conciliar solution
- **Pronounces final judgment** as if they constitute the universal church
- **Creates parallel jurisdictions** and permanent institutional division
- **Condemns entire Orthodox Church** globally rather than specific heretical bishops
- **Shows no aim toward conciliar resolution** or eventual restoration of unity

**"That would be total Protestantism...if we just said everybody can break community left and right, and it doesn't matter if there's ever a council."**¹⁰⁶

**This shows the difference:** Proper use of Canon 15 preserves the Church. Improper use fractures it. The saints' canonization proves Metropolitan Cyril's approach was Orthodox, while Old Calendarist methods were schismatic.

### Why Our Ecumenical Separation Follows the Metropolitan Cyril Model

#### The Perfect Parallel: Sergianism and Ecumenism

**The parallel between Sergianist compromise and ecumenical compromise is precise:**

**Sergianism (1927):**
- **Compromised with atheistic regime** despite ongoing Orthodox persecution
- **Publicly declared loyalty** to enemies of Orthodox faith: **"The joys of the Soviet Union are our joys, and its woes are our woes"** (Metropolitan Sergius's July 29, 1927 Declaration)¹⁷⁶
- **Denied reality** of Soviet persecution of Orthodox Christians
- **Chose institutional survival** over Orthodox witness
- **Enabled complete state control**: By 1943, **Stalin personally orchestrated church governance**, **NKVD agents controlled episcopal elections**, and **bishops functioned as state intelligence operatives**¹⁷⁷

**Ecumenism (2007-present):**
- **Embraces the "pan-heresy" containing all other heresies** - what **St. Justin Popovich** called **"the heresy of heresies"**²²
- **Treats Orthodox Church as merely one "branch"** among many valid Christian churches
- **Partners with churches that deny Orthodox doctrine** while claiming they possess valid sacraments
- **Contains within itself iconoclasm** and every other heretical attack on Orthodox truth
- **Represents "a revolt without precedent against the God-man Christ"** according to canonized saints

**The theological gravity is overwhelming:** While Sergianism was compromise with atheistic persecution, **ecumenism is embrace of the "collection of all heresies"** - making it infinitely worse than the single heresy of iconoclasm.**

**Fr. Peter Heers explicitly validates separation over ecumenism:** **"the person who today ceases commemoration for ecumenism...is right in opposing the heresy."**¹⁰⁷

### The Immutable Patristic Principle: What Fr. Heers Really Said

**Fr. Heers established an immutable Orthodox truth:** **"The person who today ceases commemoration for ecumenism is right in opposing the heresy."**

**To understand why this applies equally to laypeople, we must remind ourselves of the principles we already covered.**

**St. Theodore the Studite's Three-Tier Principle (from Chapter 2):**
1. **Heretical bishop/patriarch** - directly contaminated by heresy
2. **Priest commemorating heretical bishop** - **the Eucharist becomes contaminated** through commemoration
3. **Laypeople receiving communion** from commemorating priest - **participate in that contamination**

**The reason priests cease commemorating ecumenical bishops** is because **St. Theodore the Studite taught that commemoration contaminates the Eucharist itself.** If people are scandalized by that statement, **keep in mind: this doesn't come from us. St. Theodore the Studite said it. You'll have to disagree with him.**

**Here's the immutable logic:** If the three-tier principle is true, and **priests are right to cease commemoration because the Eucharist becomes contaminated**, then **laypeople who participate in that contaminated Eucharist are violating the exact same Orthodox teaching.**

**By the framework of St. Theodore the Studite, this principle applies equally to laypeople.** Here's why:

**The same theological reasoning** that makes a priest "right" for ceasing commemoration makes a layperson "right" for departing from churches where ecumenical bishops are commemorated. **Both recognize the same spiritual contamination** through the Three-Tier Principle.

**Fr. Heers' validation creates the parallel statement:**

- **"The priest who today ceases commemoration for ecumenism is right in opposing the heresy"**
- **"The layperson who today departs from churches where ecumenical bishops are commemorated is right in opposing the heresy"**

**Both are grounded in identical patristic authority:**
- **St. Theodore the Studite's teaching** on Eucharistic contamination through heretical commemoration
- **Canon 15's protection** for those who separate from heretical bishops
- **1700 years of Orthodox precedent** during iconoclasm and every subsequent crisis

**This will be uncomfortable** because people don't want laypeople asserting canonical authority. But **the saints consistently established** that this authority exists - **from iconoclasm through Sergianism through contemporary ecumenism.**

**The immutable truth:** If it's Orthodox for priests to cease commemoration of ecumenical bishops, **there's no way you can say laypeople aren't right in departing from churches where those bishops are commemorated.** **The same immutable truth applies** - **the Eucharist is contaminated, and St. Theodore the Studite explicitly told laypeople not to participate in that contamination.**

**You cannot say:** "A priest can cease commemoration, but laypeople should still commune from priests who don't cease commemoration." **That directly contradicts St. John Chrysostom and St. Theodore the Studite.** You'd be telling laypeople to violate the exact Orthodox teaching that validates priestly separation in the first place.

**Both follow identical canonical principles validated by the saints.** Accepting priestly authority to cease commemoration while denying lay authority to avoid contamination is **Orthodox self-contradiction.**

**By the framework of St. Theodore the Studite:** If **"the person who today ceases commemoration for ecumenism is right in opposing the heresy"** is true, then this is equally true:

> **"The layperson who today departs from churches where ecumenical bishops are commemorated is right in opposing the heresy."**


#### Why Old Calendarism Fails the Canonical Test

**Old Calendarists separated over calendar calculations, not faith violations.** They created competing synods and permanent parallel structures rather than temporary canonical resistance. **This differs completely from separation over the pan-heresy of ecumenism, which attacks Orthodox exclusivity itself.**

For comprehensive analysis of Old Calendarist errors, see **[Title of Upcoming Book]**.

**This shows the difference**: Proper use of Canon 15 preserves the Church. Improper use fractures it.

#### How Our Approach Follows Metropolitan Cyril's Canonical Method

**Our approach follows the canonized saints:** We don't pronounce final judgment but separate to protect the Church while calling for conciliar condemnation of ecumenical activities. This matches Metropolitan Cyril's method perfectly - temporary separation seeking restoration, not permanent schism like Old Calendarists.

### The Spirit vs. Letter Distinction Fr. Heers Emphasizes

**Fr. Peter Heers explains why Metropolitan Sergius missed the point:** **"He might be correct legally, but he misses the whole spirit of the canon...I think going forward, you're going to see why Saint Cyril is in the spirit of this canon."**¹⁰⁸

**Canon 15 requires conciliar orientation** - separation must aim toward eventual council resolution, not permanent division.¹⁸⁷

**The spirit of Canon 15 requires:**
- **Conciliar orientation** - always aiming toward council solution
- **Church protection** - separating to rescue, not divide
- **Canonical humility** - not pronouncing final judgment
- **Orthodox unity** - maintaining communion with universal Orthodoxy
- **Temporary separation** - seeking restoration through proper ecclesiastical process

**Our separation from ROCOR embodies this spirit because:**
- We **call for council** to condemn ecumenical compromise
- We **protect Orthodox faithful** from heretical commemoration
- We **maintain canonical humility** by not declaring final judgment
- We **preserve Orthodox unity** by refusing communion with heretical teachings

### Why Old Calendarist Accusations Don't Apply

**When opponents claim "You're just like the Old Calendarists," Fr. Heers gives us the definitive response:**

**"It's clear here that the aim is not that we simply cease commemoration, cease communion, move on. That the whole point of this canon is that they lead to a conciliar verdict."**¹⁰⁹

**Our approach differs completely from Old Calendarist errors:**

**Old Calendarists:**
- **Created permanent parallel church structures**
- **Declared canonical Orthodox Church "graceless"**
- **Pronounced final theological judgment** without council
- **Aimed at permanent separation** rather than restoration
- **Split into multiple competing jurisdictions**

**Our Approach:**
- **Maintains connection to canonical Orthodoxy** through non-compromising jurisdictions
- **Calls for ROCOR's return** to Orthodox principles
- **Awaits conciliar condemnation** of ecumenical compromise
- **Aims at restoration** of Orthodox witness
- **Preserves Orthodox unity** while rejecting specific heretical practices


### Maria's Response

*"Dr. Alexis, I understand your concern, and I know this seems radical.*

*"Throughout Church history - during iconoclasm, during Sergianism, and now - there are priests who cease commemorating bishops and patriarchs over heresy. These people were called schismatics too, but the Church canonized them as saints. Metropolitan Sergius accused the resistance movement of schism, but ROCOR proved him wrong by canonizing those very people he accused.*

*The reason priests cease commemorating heretical bishops is that commemorating them contaminates the Eucharist. Think of it this way - if your doctor refuses to work with a colleague who mixes poison with medicine, would you still go to that colleague's office for treatment?*

*"If priests are justified in not commemorating heretical bishops, then by St. Theodore the Studite's teaching, laypeople can depart from churches where those bishops are commemorated. It's the same Orthodox principle - we don't participate in spiritual contamination."*

*Dr. Alexis was silent for a moment. Then: "Maria, you're being naive. Do you really think your absence from one parish will change anything?"*

*"When 90% of Russian parishes rejected Sergianism, things changed rather quickly," Maria replied. "But Dr. Alexis, even if nothing changed, I think the saints would teach us to abide by their commandments, even if no one is watching or paying attention.*

*"I know what I converted for, and I wish to be faithful to the teachings and example of the saints, without condemning anyone else."*

*"Dr. Alexis...we used to love talking about the saints together, even if we disagreed on things. I've sent you materials on this... why do you have to characterize me and my intentions? Why can't we examine in truth what the saints taught and have a conversation about that?"*

*"Look, you're clearly still thinking I'm being schismatic or extremist or whatever. But shouldn't we understand what schism actually means before throwing those labels around?"*

### **Chapter 17: "You're Following Websites Instead of Priests"**
- **Maria's Encounter**: Dismissal of her sources as "internet research"
- "You've been radicalized by online Orthodox extremists," "terminally online orthobros"
- "You're getting theology from memes instead of real priests"
- **Maria's Response**: Primary source documentation, patristic citations vs. modern opinion
- Defending legitimate research against anti-intellectual attacks

### **Chapter 18: "But You're Not a Saint"**

**Maria's Inner Monologue**: *I was buying a children's prayer book at the Orthodox bookstore when George the parish reader approached me with his usual warm smile.*

**George's Approach:**
*"Maria! Good to see you. I heard you've been helping people understand the Fathers - that's wonderful.*

*Now, the saints were holy people with a certain level of spiritual authority that comes with that holiness.*

*The rest of us... well, we're not saints. You're not a holy elder, I'm not Saint Maximus the Confessor, and our parishioners aren't saints either. I just think it rubs people the wrong way when you say 'this saint did that' and then justify doing something similar yourself. Are you putting yourself on their level?*

*We all struggle with sins and passions. We can't go off the deep end with these stories - they're mostly there to help us understand how great the saints were. I'm not saying you're doing this, but sometimes we can accidentally imply that we too are saints.*

*I think we have to be careful not to imply that we can do what they did."*

## Orthodox Teaching on Saints and Spiritual Formation

### The Nature of Canonization

**The Orthodox Church teaches that "canonization does not make anybody a saint. Canonization recognizes that someone already was, in his own lifetime, a saint."** During their earthly lives, saints consistently had the lowest possible opinion of themselves - not as false humility to gain "humility points," but as genuine recognition of their spiritual state.

When St. Athanasius opposed Arianism, **Emperor Constantius called him "enemy of the gods" and exiled him five times.** When St. Maximus the Confessor refused heretical communion, they cut out his tongue and he died in exile as a condemned troublemaker. Saints were persecuted as troublemakers during their lifetimes, not venerated.

### How Saints Were Formed Through Reading Saints

**St. Paisios of Mount Athos was formed by reading and imitating saints' lives: "From the age of eleven, I read the lives of the Saints, fasted and kept vigil. My older brother would take the books and hide them, but that didn't stop me. I would just go into the forest and keep reading there."** The future saint put on the saints' examples - fasting, keeping vigil, following their practices - while never considering himself a saint.

St. Paisios then spent his entire life calling ordinary Christians to read the saints and follow their examples, just as he had done. He gave spiritual counsel encouraging laypeople to imitate saints' virtues and practices - the exact spiritual formation that had shaped him from age eleven.

### Saints' Universal Teaching Intent

Saints put forth their teachings and examples out of fidelity to God and fidelity to the saints who came before them - for ALL Christians. They achieved their holiness by following the same principles they teach us, principles that were available to them as ordinary Christians before any recognition.

**St. Syncletike taught about "remiss and indolent souls who are easily exhausted in the struggle for good," saying we should "praise and marvel" at even their smallest good deeds, "giving them encouragement in their struggle for the good."** Saints explicitly encouraged ordinary Christians rather than creating barriers.

### Saints Who Explicitly Rejected Spiritual Elitism

**Abbess Thaisia of Leushino directly confronted objections about ordinary Christians following saints: "Why should the saints of the past be the only 'Godbearers,' and we not have God at our side?"**

**St. Philaret of Moscow stated: "The acquisition of holiness is not the exclusive business of monks, as certain people think. People with families are also called to holiness, as are those in all kinds of professions, who live in the world, since the commandment about perfection and holiness is given not only to monks, but to all people."**

**St. Theophan the Recluse received 20-40 letters daily from laypeople and answered all of them, writing works like "The Spiritual Life and How to be Attuned to It" - a collection of 80 letters written to a young Moscow society woman.** He made it his life's work to make "complex Patristic teachings accessible to the average layperson."

### Universal Commands Without Saint-Only Exceptions

The saints never add "only if you're a saint" exceptions to their teachings about separating from heretics. When St. Maximus the Confessor said "Even if the whole world should enter into communion with the heretical Patriarch, I alone will not commune," he gave no saint-only qualifications. When Canon 15 protects those who separate from heretical bishops, it contains no sainthood requirements.

**St. Basil the Great commanded all Orthodox faithful to avoid heretical bishops, calling them "Christ-merchants" who were ordained "for the destruction of the faith."** He created no saint-only and non-saint categories for this command. The saints' teachings on avoiding heresy are universal Orthodox commands.

### The Historical Orthodox Pattern: Saints Teaching All Seekers

From the beginning, Orthodox saints welcomed and taught ordinary Christians seeking to follow their examples. **The Desert Fathers regularly received "worldly visitors," and the Apophthegmata Patrum (Sayings of the Desert Fathers) records advice specifically given to these visitors - ordinary Christians asking "Give me a word, abba, how can I be saved?"**

**St. Anthony the Great's biography was written by St. Athanasius specifically so that all Christians "may bring yourselves to imitate him" - not just monastics.** The Life of Anthony became one of the most influential books in Christian history precisely because it showed ordinary people how to follow a saint's example.

**St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain addressed his prologue to the Evergetinos to "All of you who are partakers of the heavenly Orthodox calling,"** explicitly indicating universal Christian application. The tradition of saints teaching all Christians isn't Maria's innovation - it's been Orthodox practice for 1700 years.

### Every Orthodox Christian is Called to Sainthood

Orthodox theology teaches that sainthood isn't reserved for a spiritual elite - it's the goal for every baptized Christian. **Metropolitan Kallistos Ware states definitively: "Deification is not something reserved for a few select initiates, but something intended for all alike. The Orthodox Church believes that it is the normal goal for every Christian without exception."**

This doctrine of theosis means that what the saints achieved, every Christian is called to achieve. St. Athanasius's famous teaching - "The Son of God became man, that we might become god" - wasn't written for future saints, but for ordinary Christians in Alexandria.

### The False Humility of Creating Artificial Barriers

Orthodox spiritual tradition warns against the false humility that refuses to follow saintly examples. **St. Theophan the Recluse taught: "We can think ourselves humble without having a trace of true humility... The best, or rather, the only sure way to humility is by obedience and the surrender of our own will."**

When we claim to be "too humble" to follow saints' teachings, we're actually demonstrating spiritual pride - the pride that says we know better than God what level of holiness we're capable of achieving.

### Saints Weren't Saints When They Acted

The critical point George misses: saints weren't recognized as saints when they made their most important decisions. **St. Athanasius wasn't called "Saint" when he opposed Arianism - Emperor Constantius called him "enemy of the gods" and exiled him five times.** St. Maximus the Confessor wasn't "Saint" when they cut out his tongue for refusing heretical communion - he was called a troublemaker and died in exile.

If only recognized saints can follow saints' teachings, then the saints themselves couldn't have followed their own principles when they needed them most.

### Saints Following Saints Throughout History

The entire Orthodox tradition demonstrates saints learning from and following other saints. **Elder Paisios of Mount Athos desperately wanted to visit Elder Joseph the Hesychast, but was discouraged by others who claimed Joseph was "possessed and deluded." Paisios later called not visiting this fellow saint "one of the great mistakes of his life."**

This pattern repeats throughout Orthodox history: St. Macarius learning from St. Anthony, the Desert Fathers building on each other's teachings, the entire monastic tradition based on spiritual fathers guiding disciples. These relationships existed between future saints before any canonization.

### The Orthodox Church's Clear Teaching

The Orthodox Church explicitly rejects the spiritual elitism George promotes. **The Church teaches: "Everyone is challenged to manifest holiness in their lives, for we all must become saints! This is our special - and common - calling from God. It is not something reserved for the clergy, monastics, or those who are 'more pious.'"**

**St. Symeon the New Theologian taught that direct experience of God "is attainable by all who earnestly immerse themselves in the life of prayer and is essential to interpreting sacred Scriptures."** This mystical experience belongs to all earnest Christians, not a spiritual elite.

### The Icon of God in Every Person

Perhaps most importantly, Orthodox theology teaches that **when God created humanity, "He made the first ikon, and man is created to be an ikon of God, a faithful copy of the original."** During the Divine Liturgy, the priest censes both the icons of saints and the congregation with equal reverence, "seeing the image of God in the people of God."

The same divine image present in canonized saints exists in every baptized Christian. The difference lies not in fundamental nature but in how clearly this image has been revealed through cooperation with divine grace.

### St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite




### How the Church Fathers Responded to This Objection

The Church Fathers consistently addressed and rejected objections that saintly teachings were too difficult for ordinary Christians. **St. Syncletike taught: "We should laud remiss and indolent souls who are easily exhausted in the struggle for good... Indeed if such souls should display even the smallest good deed, we must praise it and marvel at it, giving them encouragement in their struggle for the good."**

**St. John Chrysostom, whose homilies were delivered to ordinary congregations, wrote: "Should you happen to be a person who has a store of many sins, do not despair. Listen to the saints, and you will be filled with comfort... The saints are physicians, and their teachings are medicines."**

Notice what Chrysostome says: we go to doctors precisely because we're sick, not because we're healthy. The saints' teachings exist specifically for struggling sinners, not for those who've already achieved perfection.

### The Purpose of Saints' Lives in Orthodox Tradition

Orthodox hagiography serves a soteriological purpose - saints' lives are written "so that it might have a salvific effect on those who encounter it." **The Greek Orthodox Archdioceus teaches that "Saints are the ultimate role models of an Orthodox Christian" precisely because "they have achieved what all Christians are called to achieve."**

When we dismiss saints' teachings as "not applicable to us," we're rejecting the very purpose for which their lives were recorded and their teachings preserved.

### The Practical Question This Raises

George's approach creates an impossible theological framework. If saints' teachings about communion, heresy, and separation only apply to saints, then:

- Who decides when someone is "holy enough" to follow them?
- How do we become saints without following saints' examples?
- Why did the Church preserve their teachings if ordinary Christians can't use them?

**The Orthodox Church teaches that "canonization does not make anybody a saint. Canonization recognizes that someone already was, in his own lifetime, a saint."** The saints achieved their holiness by following the same principles they teach us - principles that were available to them as ordinary Christians before any recognition.

### What This Manipulation Actually Accomplishes

When Orthodox faithful are told they're "not saints" and therefore can't follow saints' teachings, this creates several dangerous results:

1. **Spiritual passivity** - people stop striving for holiness because it's "not for them"
2. **Institutional control** - only clergy get to interpret what saints "really meant"
3. **Theological ignorance** - laypeople are discouraged from serious Orthodox study
4. **Compromise enablement** - standards get lowered because "we're not saints"

This is exactly the opposite of what Orthodox tradition teaches about lay responsibility and spiritual growth.

"You're right George - I'm not a saint. But can I ask you something?

When I cite Christ's words 'Take up your cross and follow me,' am I claiming to be equal to Christ? Or am I preaching the Gospel?

So if citing Christ doesn't imply a belief that I'm equal to God, why would citing the fathers imply a belief that I'm equal to the fathers?

And George, what did St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite¹⁵⁵ say was the purpose of saints' lives? To instruct Christians, right? So if their purpose is literally to instruct us, how can following their instruction be prideful?

Also, didn't St. Symeon the New Theologian¹⁵⁶ call it heretical to claim people today cannot follow the Holy Fathers' examples? Are you defending a position a saint calls heretical?

Here's what I find interesting - weren't all our beloved saints not canonized during their lifetimes? They didn't consider themselves saints either, did they? Yet they still taught and acted. So this 'you're not a saint' objection - wouldn't that same logic have silenced the saints themselves before they were recognized?

**Look, St. Paisios himself warned against this exact mentality¹⁵⁷ - he didn't want Orthodox Christians to just 'watch the struggling athletes' instead of struggling themselves. That's all I'm trying to do - follow what the saints actually taught.**

**George's Subtle Cut:**
*"I understand your enthusiasm, Maria. But those people you're quoting were saints - they had special grace we don't possess. Surely you see the difference between their spiritual authority and... well, our situation? It's humble to recognize we're not saints. Perhaps it's best to leave such complex matters to those with proper theological training."*
