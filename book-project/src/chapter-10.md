## Chapter 10: "This Seems Extreme and Legalistic..."


- **Maria's Encounter**: The Deacon approaches her after she stops attending
- His accusations: "super-correct," being "too rigid," "even the saints teach moderation"
- **Maria's Response**: St. Theodore the Studite and Kollyvades precedent - "extremism" accusations historically meaningless
- Historical pattern: "extremism" accusations proven wrong through canonization
- **Maria's Study**: Now doing Typica at home, studying Fathers intensively
- Real-time Orthodox corrections using patristic sources

**As we established in sections 1-5**: Attending liturgy where ecumenical bishops are commemorated violates Orthodox canons. You're following 1700 years of Orthodox precedent. You're responding proportionally to something worse than iconoclasm.

**But many people will tell you**: "You're being too extreme. You're causing unnecessary division. You're being a rigorist."

**Here's what you need to understand**: The Orthodox Church has a consistent pattern of **initially condemning as "extremism" what it later recognizes as faithfulness**. The 18th-century Kollyvades movement provides the perfect example.

### The "Minor" Issue That Revealed Everything

In 1754, monks at Mount Athos began moving memorial services (with kollyva - boiled wheat) from Saturday to Sunday **for commercial convenience** - they wanted to attend Saturday markets.⁴⁰

**St. Nikodemos the Hagiorite** opposed this change. Why? Because memorial services with kollyva symbolized **"the dead human body, which awaits the Resurrection,"** making Saturday appropriate as it liturgically represents death and awaiting resurrection. Sunday celebrates Christ's resurrection, making it inappropriate for **"mourning and wailing."**⁴¹

**Sound like hairsplitting?** That's exactly what most people thought.

### The Escalating Persecution: Sound Familiar?

**The Orthodox hierarchy's response escalated dramatically**:

**1773**: Patriarch Samuel I issued a Synodal Encyclical declaring monks must follow local customs⁴²

**1774**: A synod at Koutloumousiou Monastery formally anathematized dissenters⁴³

**1776**: The Synod of Constantinople under Patriarch Sophronios II, with **16 hierarchs present**, **officially excommunicated St. Nikodemos** and other Kollyvades leaders, **declaring them "heretics"**⁴⁴

**1773**: Anti-Kollyvades monks **hired Turkish bandits** who **murdered two Kollyvades saints** - Theophanes and Paisios - drowning them **"during the vigil of the Sunday of All Saints"**⁴⁵

### The Accusations: Exactly What You're Hearing Today

The Kollyvades faced charges **identical** to those leveled at modern anti-ecumenical Orthodox:

- **"Rigorists"** - for following ancient canons strictly
- **"Troublemakers"** - for refusing to accept innovations
- **"Causing unnecessary division"** - over "minor" issues
- **"Innovators"** - ironically, for defending tradition

Some even spread rumors they were **"Masonic spies"** - showing how establishment forces demonize traditional opposition.⁴⁶

**Does this sound familiar?** If you've objected to ecumenical activities, you've probably heard identical accusations.

### The Vindication: Who Was Right?

**Here's what happened next**:

**1807**: The Holy Community of Mount Athos **formally vindicated the Kollyvades**⁴⁷

**1819**: A Council at Constantinople under Patriarch Gregory V **endorsed their positions** on frequent communion⁴⁸

**1955**: **St. Nikodemos was canonized** by the Ecumenical Patriarchate⁴⁹

**1995**: **St. Athanasios Parios was canonized**⁵⁰

**Bottom line**: Those **officially excommunicated** in 1776 as "heretics" and "troublemakers" became **canonized saints**. Those calling them "extremists" were proven wrong.

### Connecting This to Contemporary Ecumenism

**Remember what we established in sections 1-3**: When you refuse to attend liturgy where ecumenical bishops are commemorated, **you're following Orthodox canons** that forbid "joining in prayer with heretics."

**Here's the Kollyvades connection**: **Orthodox theologian Fr. George Metallinos** explicitly connects Kollyvades principles to contemporary ecumenical controversies:

> **"If one accepts a heretical baptism as valid in and of itself, he accepts also the priesthood of the clergyman who administers it, and ultimately the Eucharist that such a clergyman celebrates, too. Such is the path of ecumenical dialogue."**⁵¹

The Kollyvades defended the principle that proper Orthodox boundaries must be maintained **even in "minor" liturgical matters**. This directly parallels modern debates over ecumenical participation.

### Your Validation: Following the Kollyvades Pattern

**If you've been called "too strict" for objecting to ecumenism**, you're in excellent historical company:

**St. Nikodemos** was **officially excommunicated** for defending Orthodox tradition against **what seemed like minor innovations**. **He's now a canonized saint.**

**You're being criticized** for defending Orthodox tradition against **ecumenical innovations** that are objectively **much worse** than Saturday vs. Sunday memorial services.

**The pattern is identical**:
1. **Orthodox faithful** notice departures from tradition
2. **Hierarchy condemns them** as "extremists" and "troublemakers"
3. **Time passes** and the Church recognizes they were correct
4. **Official vindication** follows, often including canonization

### Why the Kollyvades Precedent Matters for You

**Metropolitan Kallistos Ware** called the Philokalia (compiled by the condemned-then-canonized Kollyvades) a spiritual **"time bomb"** whose influence came **"not at the moment of its first publication... but two hundred years later."**⁵²

**Similarly**: Those condemned today for "extremism" in opposing ecumenism **may be tomorrow's vindicated saints**.

**Here's what this means practically**: **Canon 15 of the First-Second Council** (which we showed in sections 2-3) protects your decision to separate from heretical bishops. **The Kollyvades vindication shows** that the Church consistently recognizes this canonical protection **even when contemporary hierarchy doesn't**.

### The Medical Analogy

Imagine two patients visiting different doctors:

**Patient A** visits a doctor who prescribes medicine slightly different from standard protocol. Other doctors call Patient A "too picky" for seeking a second opinion.

**Patient B** visits a doctor who openly mixes legitimate medicine with witch doctor remedies, insisting all approaches are equally valid. Other doctors call Patient B "too picky" for refusing treatment.

**Fifty years later**: Patient A's "pickiness" is proven justified - the protocol change was harmful. Patient B's "pickiness" is proven essential - mixing legitimate medicine with quackery was deadly.

**The Kollyvades were Patient A** - criticized for being "too strict" about what seemed minor. **You are Patient B** - being criticized for refusing something objectively worse.

**If the Church vindicated Patient A**, how much more will it vindicate Patient B?

### Connecting This to Your Canonical Authority

**As we showed in sections 1-3**: You have **canonical authority** under **Apostolic Canons 45 and 65** and **Canon 15 of the First-Second Council** to separate from bishops who **"openly declare heresy."**

**The Kollyvades precedent proves**: Even when contemporary hierarchy **doesn't recognize this canonical authority**, **the Church eventually vindicates those who exercise it faithfully**.

**St. Nikodemos** was **officially excommunicated** for following Orthodox tradition. **The Church later canonized him**. This shows that **canonical authority transcends contemporary hierarchical opinion**.

### Why "Rigorism" Usually Means "Faithfulness"

**Orthodox history reveals a consistent pattern**: Those initially condemned as **"rigorists"** for maintaining strict Orthodox positions are **later vindicated** as faithful defenders of tradition.

**Examples beyond the Kollyvades**:
- **St. Maximus the Confessor** - condemned as "stubborn" for opposing Monothelitism, later vindicated
- **St. Theodore the Studite** - persecuted as "troublemaker" for opposing iconoclasm, later vindicated
- **St. Photios** - deposed as "schismatic" for opposing papal supremacy, later vindicated

**The pattern**: **"Orthodoxy often appears as extremism to those who have drifted from tradition, but time and providence vindicate those who hold fast to the apostolic deposit."**⁵³

### What This Means for Your Decision

**When people tell you "You're being too strict" for refusing to attend liturgy where ecumenical bishops are commemorated**, remember:

1. **You're following Orthodox canons** (sections 1-3 established this)
2. **You're following heroic Orthodox precedent** (section 4 established this)
3. **You're following the pattern** that consistently leads to vindication (section 5 establishes this)

**The burden of proof isn't on you** to justify following Orthodox canons. **The burden is on those asking you to violate them** to explain why this time is different from every other time in Orthodox history.

### Your Historical Validation

**As we established in sections 1-5**: Your refusal to attend liturgy where ecumenical bishops are commemorated follows:
- **Orthodox canonical requirements** (sections 1-2)
- **Proportional response to pan-heresy** (section 3)
- **1700 years of Orthodox precedent** (section 4)

**The Kollyvades precedent adds**: **Even if contemporary hierarchy condemns your decision, Orthodox history shows such condemnation often signals that you're defending authentic tradition**.

**You're not causing division** - you're **preserving Orthodox unity** by refusing to participate in canonical violations.

**You're not being extreme** - you're **being proportionally faithful** to the severity of the crisis.

**You're not abandoning the Church** - you're **following the Church's consistent pattern** of vindication for canonical faithfulness.

### The Choice: Follow Contemporary Opinion or Orthodox Tradition

**Contemporary opinion** says: "Don't be divisive. Support your local priest. Stay in communion for unity."

**Orthodox tradition** says: **"Let any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon that merely joins in prayer with heretics be suspended"** (Apostolic Canon 45) and **"If any cleric or layman enters into a synagogue of Jews, or of heretics, to pray, let the former be deposed and let the latter be excommunicated"** (Apostolic Canon 65).

**The Kollyvades were condemned** for following Orthodox tradition against contemporary opinion. **They were later canonized**.

**The choice is clear**: Follow the pattern that leads to canonization, or follow the pattern that history proves wrong.

**Your decision to separate** from liturgy where ecumenical bishops are commemorated **places you with St. Nikodemos, St. Theodore the Studite, and every Orthodox saint** who chose canonical faithfulness over institutional convenience.

**That's not extremism** - **that's the Orthodox way**.
