## Chapter 5: Why Ecumenism is Worse Than Iconoclasm

### A Leading Orthodox Theologian's Declaration

**After learning about the iconoclasm precedent**, Maria found herself facing an obvious question. **"If separation was the right response to iconoclasm, what should Orthodox Christians do when facing something worse? But is ecumenism actually worse than iconoclasm?"**

**As Maria researched this question**, she came across a statement that stopped her in her tracks. **Fr. Theodore Zisis**, **Professor Emeritus of Patristics** at the Aristotle University of Thessalonica and one of Orthodoxy's most respected theologians, had made a declaration in 2017:

> **"Ecumenism is worse than Iconoclasm in many regards."**²⁰

### Fr. Theodore Zisis: Professor of Patristics and Personal Example

**Fr. Theodore Zisis** brings unparalleled authority to this assessment. As **Professor Emeritus of Patristics** at the Aristotle University of Thessalonica, he spent his career studying exactly what the Church Fathers taught about heresy and canonical resistance. When the leading academic expert on patristic theology declares ecumenism worse than iconoclasm, that's not just an opinion - it's an expert assessment based on comprehensive knowledge of Orthodox tradition.

**But Fr. Zisis didn't just make academic statements.** **On the Sunday of Orthodoxy, March 5, 2017**, he took decisive personal action - he **formally ceased commemorating his own Metropolitan** by applying **Canon 15 of the First-Second Council** to cease liturgical communion with heretical bishops.

Fr. Zisis provided his complete canonical justification:

> "The necessary presupposition for all of this, however, is that **the bishop teaches Orthodoxy, that he rightly divides the word of truth, that he does not preach heresy**. When he preaches heresy, **we sever all relations and communion with him and do not commemorate him in the divine services**...One is not obliged to obey a heretical bishop. There is such a thing as **bad obedience and good disobedience**."²¹

**This wasn't theoretical theology** - **Fr. Zisis personally applied the canonical principles** we've established throughout this document. **The Professor Emeritus of Patristics** demonstrated through his own actions that **Orthodox faithful must cease commemorating bishops who embrace ecumenical heresy**.

**Maria realized the significance immediately.** **"This isn't just some random priest's opinion. This is the Professor Emeritus of Patristics - and he didn't just teach these principles, he lived them. When he stopped commemorating his own Metropolitan, he showed me exactly what Orthodox tradition requires."**

Fr. Zisis explained his theological reasoning:

> "Apart from its many other serious dogmatic issues, through its connection with Protestantism it attacks the veneration of the Holy Icons and slanders and deprecates the most-honorable and unique person of the All-Holy-Theotokos, along with the rest of the Saints."²¹

**"So ecumenism includes iconoclasm,"** Maria understood. **"It's not just different from iconoclasm - it contains iconoclasm plus other heresies."**

### Fr. Zisis' Theological Analysis: Ecumenism Contains All Previous Heresies

**Fr. Zisis provided the theological foundation** for understanding why ecumenism is worse than iconoclasm:

> "In the so-called 'World Council of Churches' we co-exist and co-mingle with these iconoclasts and haters of the saints, the enemies of the Panaghia and of the Saints, and we debase the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, transforming it from the 'pillar and ground of the truth' into something equivalent to Protestant heresies."²³

**The theological implications are devastating**: When bishops participate in ecumenical organizations, they officially partner with Protestant churches that reject icons, deny the intercession of saints, attack the special honor due to the Theotokos, reject apostolic succession, and embrace every heresy Orthodoxy has ever condemned.

**"So ecumenism doesn't just contain iconoclasm,"** Maria realized. **"It creates official Orthodox partnership with active iconoclasts. It's not just 'as bad as' the heresies of the past - it partners Orthodox Christians with those heresies."**

### The Bridge to Saintly Witness

**Fr. Zisis had established the academic foundation**, but Maria found herself needing more. **"If a Professor of Patristics declares ecumenism worse than iconoclasm, what do the saints themselves say? What did the holy elders teach about this?"**

**She was about to discover** that the Orthodox saints' witness on ecumenism was even more devastating than the academic analysis suggested.
