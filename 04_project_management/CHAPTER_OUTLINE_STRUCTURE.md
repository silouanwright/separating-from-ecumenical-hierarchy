*She sees that she's received a voicemal from - Matushka Elena, Fr. Michael's wife.*

**Matushka's Opening:**
*"Christ is Risen! Hello Maria. We all miss you at church! I heard you've been struggling with some church concerns, honey. Forgive me, but if I could offer some advice... I think the saints would tell us that we need to pray more and trust that God will provide. That's what prayer is for dear - we don't have to worry about all these complicated things. Just focus on your beautiful family and let God take care of the rest. Hope to hear from you soon."*

## Why "Just Pray" Contradicts Orthodox Teaching

Picture this: A Catholic person tells you they're spiritually fine because they pray daily. Their pastor says "just pray and trust God - that's all He wants."

Your response? "Prayer without Orthodox faith is lacking. You need to join the body of Christ, which is Orthodoxy."

Now ask yourself: Why do we suddenly forget this principle applies to Orthodox Christians as well?

We tell Catholics that prayer without certain presuppositions is ineffectual. Yet we tell ourselves to "just pray" and ignore the presuppositions as well (theology, heresy).

Either Orthodox theology matters or it doesn't.

The reason Catholics can't receive communion isn't because they don't pray - many pray more than we do. They can't commune because they need catechism and baptism, and this requires them to avow (and traditionally even memorize) the Creed, and their belief in ONE holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.

**So here's the devastating question: When bishops deny Orthodox church is one through ecumenism, and unifying themselves with haters of Orthodoxy, the saints, our Panagia, why do we suddenly say "just pray about it"? Why didn't we tell the Catholic people to just pray instead of converting?

**Either Orthodox exclusivity matters enough to demand conversion, or it doesn't matter at all, if everything only requires prayer, and nothing else.**

Prayer requires Orthodox presuppositions to be spiritually effective. St. Seraphim of Sarov taught that the entire Christian life exists for acquiring grace - the commandments, canons, sacraments, everything serves this purpose.

"Prayer, fasting, vigil and all other Christian activities, however good they may be in themselves, do not constitute the aim of our Christian life, although they serve as the indispensable means of reaching this end. The true aim of our Christian life consists in the acquisition of the Holy Spirit of God. As for fasts, and vigils, and prayer, and almsgiving, and every good deed done for Christ's sake, they are only means of acquiring the Holy Spirit of God." â€” St. Seraphim of Sarov, conversation with Motovilov

**St. Maximus the Confessor** - who literally died rather than compromise with heretical hierarchy - teaches the precise relationship between prayer and obedience:

**"Prayer is a petition for blessings which come from the Word Incarnate... a vow is a decision to keep the commandments, confirmed by a promise on the part of the person making the vow; and a prayer is a petition by one who has kept the commandments that he may be transformed by the commandments he has kept."**

**Translation:** Prayer becomes effective AFTER keeping the commandments, not before. You cannot "just pray" while ignoring canonical commandments and expect spiritual transformation.

**Since the canons explicitly forbid communion with heretics, "just pray while attending compromised liturgies" violates the very prerequisite St. Maximus says prayer requires.**

**St. Theophan the Recluse** teaches what's actually required for prayer to be effective: **"It is, of course, possible for prayer alone to defeat all enemies, but in order to be strong in prayer, one must be successful in faith, hope, truth, righteousness, and all the rest."**

**Notice carefully**: He's not saying weak prayer alone is sufficient - he's teaching the prerequisites for **strong prayer**. To defeat enemies through prayer, you must FIRST achieve success in "truth, righteousness, and all the rest" - including canonical obedience.

**The person who says "just pray" while ignoring these prerequisites proves they don't understand what the saints actually teach about effective prayer.** They're asking you to use prayer as a weak substitute for the very things that make prayer strong. The reason the prayer of our saints was so strong, was that they embraced and called others to these additional virtues, in the pursuit of the acquisition of grace. Those who say otherwise manifestly show they haven't really entered into the mindset of the saints yet.

When you commune with heresy, our saints manifestly say that this repels God and his grace. Repeatedly. Our saints were not legalists. They all understood heresy repels the Holy Spirit. This is why they all, in UNISON, rejected heresy, and all the more so, did they reject the heresy of all heresies, Ecumenism (of which there is an extensive witness in Chapter X).

Therefore, "Just pray" is Protestant thinking. When you align with heretics, you become like Protestants - separated from God, and your prayers unheard. This is not our thinking, but merely what our saints in complete agreement say.

There is another image that can help one understand this.

If one is tending to a garden, and they have a bucket full of tools, a good gardener will use the best tool available for the right job. They might use a shovel in some cases, or a rake in others. They wouldn't say "I can only use the best tool, and no other tool." This doesn't make any sense. And in fact, by not utilizing all the tools available to them, their garden dies, and then the best tool is completely ineffectual. Do you see?

The person who says to "just pray" doesn't understand that we are struggling for an eternal reality, and that this necessitates using every single tool available. The person who says to "just pray" is avoiding the many other things our saints and elders teach us, that we may use all the tools in our bucket, to harvest all the grace that we can.

We as Orthodox Christians are maximalists. We are fighting for eternity. We do not simply just use the best tool, but ALL tools available to us. Using the tool we like, makes us no different from Protestants who think John 3:16 is all they need to know, and can simply discard the rest of the Bible.

If one reads the full lives of the saints, they will manifestly see that they did *not* simply just pray.

The saints demand action combined with prayer. St. Basil the Great faced identical "just pray" arguments during the Arian crisis. His response: **"Those who pretend to confess Orthodox faith but continue to commune with heretics - should not only be excluded from communion, but should not even be called brothers."** St. Basil didn't say "just pray about Arian bishops." He demanded complete separation.

St. Theodore the Studite taught that **"Everyone who resists is a Confessor"** - he called resistance "Orthodox and God-pleasing." St. John Chrysostom declared: **"Not to enable a sinner by silence and inaction is mercy; to enable a sinner by avoiding reproofs is cruelty."** The Apostolic Constitutions command: **"Care must be had to avoid destructive shepherds... that sheep which follows a bad shepherd is exposed to unavoidable death."**

Our saints teach that **following the commandments and the Fathers is the bedrock for establishing prayer.** When you ignore canonical teachings to "just pray about heretical bishops," you've adopted Protestant prayer theology while calling it Orthodox.

**Heresy affects our own acquisition of grace** whether we ourselves are heretics, or we are commemorating them, or we are part of Divine Liturgies where they are commemorated (as established by St. Theodore the Studite in his 3 tier system, explained in chapter 2). When we're spiritually united to heretical bishops through commemoration, **it directly undermines our own prayer life and capacity to receive grace.**

So "just pray while ignoring these teachings" asks you to maintain spiritual practices while participating in the very contamination that undermines those practices. **You cannot separate Orthodox prayer from Orthodox obedience.** When you align with heretics, you become like Protestants - separated from God, your prayers unheard.

**Theological Framework**: The "just pray" manipulation weaponizes Orthodox spiritual concepts against Orthodox tradition, creating false dichotomies between prayer and canonical obedience that contradict 1700 years of patristic teaching.

**Maria's Full Response**:

*"Truly He is Risen! Hello Matushka,"*

*I used to be Protestant many years ago, as you know. My problem was that I took small parts of the Bible - John 3:16 - and made this the focal point of Christianity. I look at my Bible today, which has over 700,000 words... and really, I only cared about 30 words or so. Was this Christianity? Or an idol of my own making?*

*Converting to Orthodoxy and reading the Fathers and saints, I notice that whenever the saints say something we like, we celebrate it. But when they teach something that makes us uncomfortable, we downplay it, even using their own teachings to do it. 'Practice silence.' 'Simply pray.' But isn't it possible to do both? Can we not pray AND follow the other teachings of the saints?*

*I recall a story about St. Paisios the Athonite... When a man came asking him to pray for his son, he said 'I will pray, but you will need to do something as well.' He didn't chastise him for coming. He didn't tell him to just pray. He said this required something in addition. Saints like St. Theodore the Studite, St. John Chrysostom, and St. Maximus the Confessor didn't simply restrict themselves to prayer. They sought to live up to ALL the commandments, canons, and dogmas of the Church.*

*Do we not judge the saints when we do this? Are we not picking and choose what we like, and when someone embraces the challenging teachings of the saints - not just the sweet and comforting parts - we don't like it? Are we not doing what the Protestants do in this way?"*

**Matushka's Response:**

*"Maria, honey... you used to be such a sweet Orthodox mother. What happened to you? This is exactly what happens when people get too into theology instead of just focusing on loving God and their families.*

*You're a mother, not a theologian. This isn't loving behavior toward your priest or your parish family. You've lost all that Christian love and kindness since you started this 'research.' This is what happens when converts try to become theologians instead of just being grateful for what the Church has given them. You used to be so peaceful before you started reading all this stuff.*

*Focus on your beautiful children instead of worrying about bishops you've never even met. This obsession isn't healthy, honey.*

*...I'll be praying for you, Maria."*

### **Chapter 12: "The Church Uses Economia" - Father Michael's Threats**
- **Maria's Encounter**: Father Michael learns she's been "spreading dissent"
- People have been asking her for explanations, she's simply sharing her canonical position
- His accusations: "causing scandal," "disturbing parish peace," "making it impossible to help you"
- Economia manipulation: Using pastoral flexibility to justify ignoring canonical violations
- **Maria's Response**: Economia cannot override fundamental doctrine, proper vs. improper applications
- The threat: "If you continue disturbing the peace..."

### **Chapter 13: "You're Promoting Schism" - The Canon 15 Defense**

**Maria's Inner Monologue**: *It's been two months since I stopped attending Divine Liturgy. Word has gotten around the Orthodox community, and I can feel the judgment when I run into people at the grocery store.*

*My phone buzzes - a text from Dr. Alexis, an Orthodox theologian I met at a conference last year. "Can we talk? I'm concerned about what I'm hearing."*

**Dr. Alexis's Encounter:**
*"Maria, I heard about your... situation with the parish. Look, I understand you have concerns about ecumenism, and some of those concerns might even be valid. But what you're doing - this separating from canonical bishops - this is exactly how schisms start.*

*You're breaking unity with the Church. The Old Calendarists did the same thing in the 1920s - they used Canon 15 to justify their separation, and look where it led them. They became a tiny, irrelevant sect outside the canonical Church.*

*You have no authority to separate from canonical bishops based on your personal interpretation of their actions. These bishops are in canonical communion with the entire Orthodox world. Who are you - a laywoman, a convert - to declare them heretical?*

*This path you're on leads to schism, Maria. You're following the exact same pattern as every group that's broken away from the Church throughout history. Don't become another Old Calendarist.*

*The unity of the Church matters more than your theological concerns. Come back before you make yourself and your family schismatics."*

## The Difference Between Schism and Canonical Separation

**Contemporary Orthodox Theological Validation - Fr. Peter Heers:**

Fr. Peter Heers, respected Orthodox theologian and professor, provides definitive contemporary validation for applying Canon 15 to ecumenical compromise:

**"The person who today ceases commemoration for ecumenism...is right in opposing the heresy."**

This directly validates the canonical position - separation over ecumenism follows proper Orthodox interpretation, not schismatic innovation.

On ecumenical theories: **"All these heretical theories that are trying to...pass off as Orthodox, these things are new. Does that mean that we don't know if they're heresy or not? Of course we know they're heresy."**

Fr. Heers emphasizes the proper framework: **"We need to have people stand up and say, No, this is delusional if their bishop is preaching it. And yet that should not be an end in itself."**

This confirms:
- Ecumenical compromise constitutes heresy requiring Canon 15 separation
- Contemporary Orthodox faithful have the right to resist episcopal delusion
- Such separation is canonically praiseworthy when aimed toward conciliar solution
- Waiting for formal condemnation doesn't negate the duty to separate from active heresy

**The Orthodox Approach to Canon 15:**
- Faithful must separate from bishops actively preaching heretical positions
- Separation aims toward conciliar resolution, not permanent division
- Canon 15 protects those who separate to "protect the church from delusion"
- Orthodox tradition validates such separation as necessary and praiseworthy

**The Critical Distinction: Schism vs. Separation**

**Schism** means departing from Orthodox teaching to create innovation or division.

**Canonical Separation** means maintaining Orthodox teaching by withdrawing from those who have departed from it.

**The Old Calendarist Example - A Case Study:**

Yes, Old Calendarists invoked Canon 15. But the question isn't whether Canon 15 was invoked - it's whether it was invoked **correctly**.

When Metropolitan Sergius compromised with the Soviet state, Metropolitan Cyril and others separated under Canon 15. Metropolitan Sergius accused them of "schism." History vindicated Metropolitan Cyril - he was maintaining Orthodox teaching while Sergius had departed from it.

**The same canonical principle applies differently:**
- **Proper Canon 15 use**: Separating to maintain Orthodox exclusivity against ecumenical heresy
- **Improper Canon 15 use**: Separating over calendar changes that don't constitute heresy

**The canon itself is neutral** - its proper application determines whether separation is Orthodox resistance or schismatic innovation.

**Maria's Full Response:**

*"Truly He is Risen, Dr. Alexis. Thank you for reaching out with your concerns.*

*I understand the Old Calendarist comparison, but I think there's a crucial distinction we need to make. Yes, they invoked Canon 15 - but the question isn't whether Canon 15 was used, but whether it was used correctly.*

*When Metropolitan Sergius compromised with the Soviets, Metropolitan Cyril separated under Canon 15. Sergius called it 'schism.' But history vindicated Cyril - he was maintaining Orthodox teaching while Sergius had departed from it. The canon was applied correctly.*

*The same principle applies today. Ecumenism explicitly denies Orthodox exclusivity - the very principle we demand Catholic converts affirm in the Creed. When bishops embrace the 'branch theory' of Christianity, they're departing from Orthodox teaching.*

*I'm not innovating or creating new doctrine. I'm maintaining the Orthodox position that we are the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church - not one branch among many valid churches. That's what I believed when I converted, what I taught my children, and what the Church has always proclaimed.*

*The Old Calendarists were separating over calendar changes. I'm separating over denial of Orthodox exclusivity. Fr. Peter Heers - a respected Orthodox theologian - explicitly states that 'the person who today ceases commemoration for ecumenism...is right in opposing the heresy.'*

*You say I have no authority as a laywoman and convert. But Canon 15 specifically protects laypeople who separate from heretical bishops. The canon doesn't ask about my gender or conversion status - it asks whether I'm maintaining Orthodox teaching or departing from it.*

*As for unity - true unity is unity in Orthodox truth, not institutional conformity. When bishops deny that Orthodoxy is the exclusive path to salvation, they've already broken unity with 2000 years of Orthodox teaching. I'm not breaking unity - I'm refusing to participate in its violation.*

*The question isn't whether I'm authorized to judge bishops. The question is whether I'm authorized to maintain the Orthodox faith I was taught when I converted. Canon 15 says yes - I am."*

**Dr. Alexis's Response:**

*"Maria, you're rationalizing schismatic behavior with sophisticated theological language. This is exactly what every schismatic group does - they claim they're the ones maintaining 'true' Orthodoxy while everyone else has fallen away.*

*You're making yourself judge and jury over the entire Orthodox Church. These bishops are in communion with Constantinople, Moscow, Antioch - the entire Orthodox world. Are you really claiming that you understand Orthodox teaching better than all of them?*

*This path leads nowhere good. You'll end up like those isolated traditionalist groups - bitter, alone, and irrelevant. Your children will grow up outside the canonical Church because of your theological pride.*

*The Orthodox Church isn't perfect, but it's the Church Christ established. You don't get to declare it apostate and start your own version of Orthodoxy.*

*Come back, Maria. Before it's too late."*

**Theological Framework**: The schism accusation weaponizes institutional loyalty against canonical obedience, creating false equivalence between proper Canon 15 application (maintaining Orthodox teaching) and actual schism (departing from Orthodox teaching). The accusation itself reveals the accuser's prioritization of institutional unity over Orthodox truth.


### **Chapter 14: "This Isn't Loving/Charitable"**
- **Maria's Encounter**: Another Orthodox Mother attacks her stance as unloving
- "Where's the love of Christ in what you're doing?" "You've become cold and unloving"
- "Real Orthodox Christians are known for love, not harsh judgments"

- **Maria's Encounter**: Dismissal of her sources as "internet research"
- "You've been radicalized by online Orthodox extremists," "terminally online orthobros"
- "You're getting theology from memes instead of real priests"

### **Chapter 20: The Homily Attack - Public Destruction**

**The Full Scene**:

*Six weeks after I stopped attending, my friend Sarah called me, clearly uncomfortable. "Maria, I need to tell you something that happened at Divine Liturgy yesterday. I don't know if I should, but... I think you need to know."*

*She described how Father Michael had deviated from his usual homily. Instead of preaching on the Gospel reading, he had positioned himself at the center of the ambo, his voice carrying that particular tone I knew meant this particular homily would be intense.*

*He began...*

*In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.*

*The congregation said "Amen".*

*He paused for a while... talked a little about the Gospel reading and its relevance... and then said this:*

*"....there's a certain individual who used to attend parish," he had announced, his eyes scanning the congregation, "whom many of you know, who unfortunately, thinks they know better than the Church. They've decided that their private interpretation of some obscure canons and out of context citations from the saints, makes them holier than the rest of you."*

*Sarah said the church had gone completely silent. Everyone knew exactly who he meant.*

*"The Gospel reading today, focuses on the Pharisees that Christ condemned. They were so 'correct' that they forgot what it means to be humble... So obsessed with finding fault in others that they can't see the beam in her own eye."*

*The words hit Maria like physical blows, even hearing them secondhand. This was her priest - the man she had trusted with her spiritual formation, who had heard her children's confessions and her own, who had blessed her home.*

*Sarah's voice was barely a whisper as she continued: "He said... that some people become so 'puffed up' with their own knowledge that they lose all Christian love. That they choose theological pride over obedience to the Church. That they become a scandal to simple believers."*

*...tears streamed down Maria's face.*

*But then - Father Michael's voice suddenly became warm and pastoral again. Sarah said he looked out over the congregation with that gentle smile Maria remembered so well and said: "But we, my beloved parishioners, must respond with love. The saints teach us to love even those who persecute us, who cause division among us. We must pray for these people and their families, that God might soften her hardened hearts and restore to them the humility of the Gospel. Amen."*

*Maria asked if anyone said anything to the priest... but she already understood that for many, they agreed with what the priest said about her. For the few that didn't, their stance was that this is the closest Orthodox parish for miles, they live in this area, and so there's no need to rock the boat. "As long as we can confess and commune, let us practice silence, as the saints teach"....*

*Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. (1 Corinthians 11:27)*

*What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? ...When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean...seek justice, correct oppression, bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause. (Isaiah 1:11-17)*

*Maria thanked Sarah, and got off the phone.*

*She felt humiliated, scared, betrayed, and unloved. She felt alone.*

**Analysis**: Public spiritual assassination using the ambo, weaponizing Scripture against Orthodox tradition, community complicity through silence, divine judgment on those who enable spiritual abuse
